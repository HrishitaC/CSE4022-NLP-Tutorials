Our\\xa0community champions work very hard to make sure that all newbies are welcomed when they first post, and we understand that it’s a big step to post for the first time on a forum like this, especially if you aren’t feeling great.\\nIt’s important to remember, though, that these forums are a community of real people, just like you, not a one-on-one support environment like going to see your psychologist. \\xa0\\nTo get the best out of being here, one of the best tips we can offer is give support to receive support.\\nBeing a good community member means:\\n\\n participating in different threads (not just your own), \\nreplying to people who have taken the time to reply to you (even if it’s just to say thank you), and...\\nposting words of emotional support and encouragement when you see others who are hurting and reaching out.\\n\\nYou don’t have to feel obliged to solve the problems of others: that’s not what we’re here for.

Maybe someone has experienced something similar.\\n\\r\\nA few weeks ago I had to do a very difficult thing. I had been feeling for a while that I was being treated without respect by a group of people whom I considered my friends. I really cared about them, and I still do, so it was incredibly hard to realise that I just felt so... uncomfortable. I am afraid of talking about this because I am scared of being harassed online by them if I am found, so I am going to be vague, I hope that's okay and not too confusing.\\n\\r\\nI have had moments of severe depression and occasional anxiety attacks throughout my life, where I cannot cope and needed to speak to my friends for support. I always did my best to offer an ear in return to support them as well, because I have many other friends that have been through some intensely difficult times and really needed an ear, or a shoulder and were occasionally a bit blunt or negative because they were sad. I can completely relate to that position and I have always tried my best to put myself in other people's shoes. \\n\\r\\nFor at least a year though, I felt that something was terribly wrong. Like a gut feeling. I now see in hindsight that there were red flags everywhere, I was spoken to repeatedly in a passive-aggressive manner, blamed for things that were beyond my control and for not doing enough, insulted in front of friends (and my own family!) at a major event and when I asked numerous times what was happening, telling them that our friendship mattered to me and that I was lost... I was accused of being aggressive or confrontational. I felt like I was going crazy and I still feel like I am. I could not support them when I was feeling attacked like this, which they then continued to blame me for.\\n\\r\\nI am so confused and hurt even now. Did I deserve that because I had moments of weakness and needed help? I was constantly apologising, and if they had told me that I was annoying then I would have listened and taken it seriously because they really mattered to me. It's really awful that as soon as I stood up and left I began to receive harassing texts accusing me of being passive-aggressive and a liar. I just felt so crazy hearing that. I stopped to think... did all the times I was trying to be genuine not matter? Was I not doing my best? Had I been making it up?\\n\\r\\nThank you for reading.\\n\", 'Anxiety'], ['\\nHi, first time posting on here (or anywhere for that matter about this stuff)... I have OCD and Bipolar Disorder.\\r\\nAs i sit typing I am aware of every noise in the house and outside being \"They/Them\" coming to get me. My OCD has been leading me down dark rabbit holes of thoughts and images recently (in a self-destructive spiral) and I couldnt take it any more.\\r\\nI chatted with one of the BeyondBlue people who helped me to seek out a positive distraction for the night so I joined this community and started to type.\\r\\nFor me OCD is like a little urge going \"just one more dark thought, just until midnight, then i will let you go....\" but it never stops! It is never satisfied until I feel like giving up and taking one way out or another (neither are good options by the way!).\\r\\nI am a good person with a good heart and I know i would never do these things yet that spiral is so strong, so desperate and so persistent that I fear I may not be strong enough to fight it. Seeing others going through this same process makes me feel like im not alone, yet i fear that \"They/Them\" would have me locked away because of the \"Darkness\" within me.\\r\\nWhen I was younger (18-19 yrs old) I first experienced this dark spiral and it terrified me so much that I contemplated suicide so that I could never hurt anyone like that! Thankfully I am alive but the OCD \"Darkness\" remains and it is a constant battle. How do you fight what you cannot see/touch/destroy?\\r\\nIm sorry for this stream of consciousness post but im really trying to convey my feelings as best as i can. Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you for (hopefully) accepting me as I am.\\r\\n(ps: I am seeing a psych and I am medicated and for those two things i am forever grateful).\\n', 'Anxiety'], [\"\\nI posted in a couple of other threads but I decided to start a new one so I can get my thoughts together.\\nI started my career as an engineer.  I did that for 7 years, then became a project manager of engineering projects.  I have been doing that for 9 years.  I have been in my current job for 1 year.  I started my current job after my company made my previous role redundant in a restructure, and they redeployed me into this role.  I moved from a project manager role in a sector that I had lots of experience in, to a project manager role in a sector I have no experience in.\\nI think I have felt anxiety to some degree during my entire career, but it has been really bad since the start of 2020.  I don't have experience in the sector that I'm now working in, and I'm supposed to manage people doing work that I have no understanding of.  The company restructure that led to me changing sectors stripped the expertise needed to get work done.  Many times I have asked for a resource to do certain tasks, and the response has been 'Joe Bloggs used to do that, but he was made redundant so now it's the the project manager's job.'  I don't have the expertise to do what's required, so I feel like I'm being set up for failure.  My workload is too big for me to manage, and I'm falling further and further behind.  I've spoken to my manager about the issues I'm facing on my projects, said they will take time to resolve, and asked to renegotiate deadlines.  His response has been along the lines of 'Oh, you can still meet the deadline.  It won't take as long as you say to resolve the issue.'  My manager is disconnected from reality and has no appreciation for the effort actually required to get something done, and doesn't want to listen when I try to explain it to him.  So I have been working under immense pressure.\\nI have been having stomach cramps that make me run to the toilet 3-4 times a day, and I often feel like vomiting.\\nI have spoken to a psychologist and she said I don't have mental health issues.  She said I need to find a job that suits my personality.\\n\", 'Anxiety'], ['\\nHey...\\nso, I actually only find myself at these forums when I need comfort. It’s been a little while and I’ve been doing well.\\nI’ve recently lost close to 18kgs - by trying, not because of anything sinister. Was super happy, going great. Im quite big, so any loss is wonderful. I started noticing change sin my body - as you do. Except, I felt a bit too hard and felt a lump kind of on my left side but more just under my rib cages (in that fatty area)\\nRationally I know it’s fat, and there’s some on the right side, but the left side is what I’ve focussed on again. So now, I’m that area, I feel like I can feel something wrong. I’m very gassy - as in, it gurgles and feels like bubbles, rarely any pain but when there’s pain, it’s gas.\\nI’m constantly focussed on it, so hyper aware that I feel things now on the same side but on my back. It tingles, it bubbles, it feels tight and also feels heavy. So when I lay on my tummy, it feels as if there’s something there.\\n \\nUNTIL I DONT THINK OF IT.\\nIf I’m distracted or with friends, 9/10 I feel not a thing. Can go for hours with nothing. I wake up with nothing until my brain tries to see if it’s still there.\\ni straight away go to cancer. Every time.\\ni have pushed so hard on that side to try and feel anything, done it to the other side too, and it all feels exactly the same. \\nif I left my shirt, I feel nothing. Miraculously.\\nits like I’m so hyper aware that I’m feeling every tiny thing.\\ni went away recently, and it felt like it started to go. I came back and I was doing okay and then on Sunday (a week ago) my work bestie/mate passed away, and let me tell you. My anxiety is through the roof.\\nim so scared to see a doctor. The first thing they say is about my weight but then also I’m scared of the testing.\\nit feels like gas. The fat lumps I feel have been there the whole time but now I feel them more because of the weight loss. That’s when it all started. \\n\\r\\nblurgh. I’m so over this. \\n', 'Anxiety']]\n"

I can't stand the isolation and hate the restrictions on my freedoms.  I was isolated before this started and now it's worse.  I feel that the isolation will actually kill me if it goes on for much longer and I am spiralling downwards.  This is made worse by the fact that the reasons for the lock down are no longer in existence.  I know that on 1 June things will get better, but it seems like a lifetime away just now.  Isolation is used as a form of torture in some countries and solitary confinement is a punishment.  I feel that this is being imposed on me, even though I haven't committed any crime.  Some people cope better than others with these sorts of conditions.  You tube videos, baking cakes, and knowing that flowers will eventually bloom doesn't make any difference.

I'm scared, I'm anxious, I'm sad, I can't think straight, I'm in pain at times but have strong medication. I have addictions I need to stop pretty much asap! I pray, I cry, I shake and deeply hurt by hurting others by my diagnosis. I think of chemo all the time, the operation, my life. I'm not coping. I haven't told my father and don't know how to, his old and already lost his wife his brother, 2 sons and grandson in the past ten years. I know you can't do anything about any of this but if just one person could pray for me I would be grateful. I'm sad by what this virus has done to the world, the heartache it has caused for so many people, the personal stories I hear, the depression lockdown is causing. I try make the most of the times I feel okay, both physically and mentally but I just fall to pieces sometimes. I'm trying to be strong and pray the lord will give me the strength I need. I'm not brave, nor do I think I deserve the love I get sometimes for some reason, but please look after each other and help each other, please do something kind for someone because it makes so much of a difference in someone's life.

I\\'m 22, but I\\'m not very functional and I very rarely work since I\\'m in a job with my step-dad who I don\\'t get along with well at times (same with my mum). I\\'m also somewhat autistic (\"highly\" functioning) and that anxiety and depression (non-suicidal) affect me, but my main issue is that I want almost nothing to do with nearly anything Australian due to how much I hate this place and most of them for complying with a subjectively bad system.\\n\\r\\nBut yeah, what I hate about this country and its culture is its authoritarianism (gun laws; coronavirus regulation, beaucracies everywhere, signs warning fines punishment everywhere, so many victimless crimes etc), being treated like convicts, anti-intellectualism, tall-poppy syndrome, entitlement, and almost all Australians happily complying to their masters regardless..\\n\\r\\nHere\\'s an example for authoritarianism, a Tasmanian was seriously arrested for camping out in the middle of nowhere for one night during national Coronavirus lockdowns.. This is how bossy our society is, that would not happen in libertarian parts of America I want to go to.\\n\\r\\nBeing treated like convicts, minorities including myself not being able to have any say in politics due to it being democratic (only cares about majorities) and that our police don\\'t care for oppressed minorities such as gun owners; male domestic violence victims, drug users etc. They only care about helping the state strip their rights due to being legal.\\n\\r\\nAnti-intellectualism, most of us think we should \"just comply\" with coronavirus regulations regardless of others\\' situations and that most Australians are so fearful of less gun control with SO MUCH arrogance.\\n\\r\\nTall-Poppy syndrome, being so arrogant about America everytime they talk about that country despite not knowing much about it and thinking we\\'re the best country when we have so many flaws.\\n\\r\\nEntitlement, most of us forcing others to be like us to have a \"right\" to safety.\\n\\r\\nCompliance, a word you cannot disagree with without harsh criticism from our culture. If something\\'s illegal, our society automatically thinks its taboo.. Even women wanting to defend themselves with tasers.\\n\\r\\nHowever..

I went through the tapering of the medication and then through weeks of withdrawal symptoms I could barely function.\\n\\nOnce the side effects subsidered I initially felt ok but a few weeks of not being on anything I developed a huge knot feeling in my stomach from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed, it was their if I woke up at night even. My moods flattered and and I break down in tears often.. I am trying to exercise more, read positive quotes, spend time with my family but I am trying to think more positive but it usually gets shot down pretty quickly usually by me.\\nI haven't notice a results and can't find enjoyment out of anything or look forward to anything.\\n\\nI had my first session with a psychologist last week tho this first session I don't walk away with anything and now it's another 2 wweeks before I can go again.. At the same time I'm worried and thinking is this the right person for me am I going to get anything out of it? Or am I wasting my time and in 1 month I'm no closer to getting out and then have to start all over again..\\n\\nI'm very lost as I don't know if I should find a different psychiatrist and talk to them while I see a psychologist...

I’m now 6 months into medication and receiving occasional CBT. I think over the last month has been the best time I’ve had in my life. The stress of HSC is still existent, but the medications really have alleviated the low moods. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. My question is: How likely is it that I will experience a relapse of both diagnosis's? Are they really lifelong illnesses I have to acustom to, or will it one day be gone?\\n \\ncheers,\\njonah \\n\", 'Depression']]\n"

She died in 2006 when our kids were 9 and 11. At the time, she and i had been divorced for about 8 years and we had been sharing custody of our kids. I found out through a grandparent that, for the first time, my daughter went to the grave site. I am so pleased that she is acknowledging her grief. This post, though, is selfishly about me. The eldest of the two has not spoken to me in four years and the youngest, although living with me, puts a very clear wall between me and her grief. I have to tell you that I'm trans. I understand how that must complicate things but, there is no doubt in my mind about the love I have for my children and the depth of my desire to reach out and connect. That connection does not occur. I went down the street this morning to get a coffee and I saw a lovely mum playing with her toddler after probably dropping some of her other kids at school. The beautiful little kid was reaching out to their parent and it reminded me of how much things used to be like that with my kids. I am so sad. I don't know what to do with this sadness.

Maybe someone has experienced something similar.\\n\\r\\nA few weeks ago I had to do a very difficult thing. I had been feeling for a while that I was being treated without respect by a group of people whom I considered my friends. I really cared about them, and I still do, so it was incredibly hard to realise that I just felt so... uncomfortable. I am afraid of talking about this because I am scared of being harassed online by them if I am found, so I am going to be vague, I hope that's okay and not too confusing.\\n\\r\\nI have had moments of severe depression and occasional anxiety attacks throughout my life, where I cannot cope and needed to speak to my friends for support. I always did my best to offer an ear in return to support them as well, because I have many other friends that have been through some intensely difficult times and really needed an ear, or a shoulder and were occasionally a bit blunt or negative because they were sad. I can completely relate to that position and I have always tried my best to put myself in other people's shoes. \\n\\r\\nFor at least a year though, I felt that something was terribly wrong. Like a gut feeling. I now see in hindsight that there were red flags everywhere, I was spoken to repeatedly in a passive-aggressive manner, blamed for things that were beyond my control and for not doing enough, insulted in front of friends (and my own family!) at a major event and when I asked numerous times what was happening, telling them that our friendship mattered to me and that I was lost... I was accused of being aggressive or confrontational. I felt like I was going crazy and I still feel like I am. I could not support them when I was feeling attacked like this, which they then continued to blame me for.\\n\\r\\nI am so confused and hurt even now. Did I deserve that because I had moments of weakness and needed help? I was constantly apologising, and if they had told me that I was annoying then I would have listened and taken it seriously because they really mattered to me. It's really awful that as soon as I stood up and left I began to receive harassing texts accusing me of being passive-aggressive and a liar. I just felt so crazy hearing that.
