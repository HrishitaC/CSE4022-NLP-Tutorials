hey there, what physical symptoms of anxiety do you experience? 
I often feel very alone in my experience of having physical chest (what I think are heart) spasms and was wanting to create a space for everyone to list their physical feelings that come hand in hand with anxiety so we can all feel less alone. 
hope everyone is well.

There is a thread under Depression just like this so I thought why not start an anxiety one?

Hi everyone, particularly any new members who may be reading.¬†
From time to time, we get contacted by members who are unhappy that they haven‚Äôt received a lot of replies to their posts. Our¬†community champions work very hard to make sure that all newbies are welcomed when they first post, and we understand that it‚Äôs a big step to post for the first time on a forum like this, especially if you aren‚Äôt feeling great.
It‚Äôs important to remember, though, that these forums are a community of real people, just like you, not a one-on-one support environment like going to see your psychologist. ¬†
To get the best out of being here, one of the best tips we can offer is give support to receive support.
Being a good community member means:

 participating in different threads (not just your own), 
replying to people who have taken the time to reply to you (even if it‚Äôs just to say thank you), and...
posting words of emotional support and encouragement when you see others who are hurting and reaching out.

You don‚Äôt have to feel obliged to solve the problems of others: that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre here for. But you can offer empathy and what you‚Äôve learned from your own life experiences, even if it‚Äôs just a line or two, eg. ‚ÄúI don't know what to say, but I want to give you my support and tell you I care about what is happening to you and hope life will get better soon.‚Äù
Try to develop an interest in the journeys of others here on the forums. You may be surprised at how good being an active, caring member here can make you feel.

Hi there,
As if that wasn't bad enough I also have mild cases of intellectual disability and Asperger‚Äôs syndrome that make those things even tougher and harder to come out.
Until June this year I was dealing with The Corona Virus pretty well even with some adjustments like face masks but got used to them over time which was great.
However I was getting upset worrying about a certain person who I have always put above my own well being before my own , once I found out they were safe and being looked after I had a change of view about things and see things differently now even in a slight change , as my feelings towards them have always stayed pretty much the same but now I have known to change it down to make it more realistic as I have done in another area too.
If you have a clear image in your mind and a positive outlook is it more than likely things will be alright or turn out good?
I also have these dreams where I see the person in a slightly different light even though they are still important to me for example me being a friend and being treated as a friend in her presence and the presence of her family.
For the last four years I changed a few things and eased off in certain areas that the old me would have struggled to know what to do , probably because she still thought I was interested in her more than friends and that is what worries me.
I don't feel I can progress with the fifteen years of internal stuff until I get it said out to her in person and then we can reconcile hopefully and then hopefully can be friends again as I don't deal with loss very well and the thought of death of someone close to me or something happening to me makes me get worried I may never be able to fix this up.
In March 2019 we had bush fires six kilometres from our house and it was one of the most scary things I have ever witnessed , and now with The Corona Virus it reminds me of what is important to me even though I may have not explained certain things clearly to a certain person in the past.
Giving up is not an option but I am scared and worried about doing the wrong thing , I don't know what to do still hence that is why I have sat on the fence for the last four years.

Hi guys, I have been thinking about writing about this for a while and I am still very nervous to write it, but I figure I should at least give it a try. Maybe someone has experienced something similar.

A few weeks ago I had to do a very difficult thing. I had been feeling for a while that I was being treated without respect by a group of people whom I considered my friends. I really cared about them, and I still do, so it was incredibly hard to realise that I just felt so... uncomfortable. I am afraid of talking about this because I am scared of being harassed online by them if I am found, so I am going to be vague, I hope that's okay and not too confusing.

I have had moments of severe depression and occasional anxiety attacks throughout my life, where I cannot cope and needed to speak to my friends for support. I always did my best to offer an ear in return to support them as well, because I have many other friends that have been through some intensely difficult times and really needed an ear, or a shoulder and were occasionally a bit blunt or negative because they were sad. I can completely relate to that position and I have always tried my best to put myself in other people's shoes. 

For at least a year though, I felt that something was terribly wrong. Like a gut feeling. I now see in hindsight that there were red flags everywhere, I was spoken to repeatedly in a passive-aggressive manner, blamed for things that were beyond my control and for not doing enough, insulted in front of friends (and my own family!) at a major event and when I asked numerous times what was happening, telling them that our friendship mattered to me and that I was lost... I was accused of being aggressive or confrontational. I felt like I was going crazy and I still feel like I am. I could not support them when I was feeling attacked like this, which they then continued to blame me for.

I am so confused and hurt even now. Did I deserve that because I had moments of weakness and needed help? I was constantly apologising, and if they had told me that I was annoying then I would have listened and taken it seriously because they really mattered to me. It's really awful that as soon as I stood up and left I began to receive harassing texts accusing me of being passive-aggressive and a liar. I just felt so crazy hearing that. I stopped to think... did all the times I was trying to be genuine not matter? Was I not doing my best? Had I been making it up?

Thank you for reading.

Hi, first time posting on here (or anywhere for that matter about this stuff)... I have OCD and Bipolar Disorder.
As i sit typing I am aware of every noise in the house and outside being ""They/Them"" coming to get me. My OCD has been leading me down dark rabbit holes of thoughts and images recently (in a self-destructive spiral) and I couldnt take it any more.
I chatted with one of the BeyondBlue people who helped me to seek out a positive distraction for the night so I joined this community and started to type.
For me OCD is like a little urge going ""just one more dark thought, just until midnight, then i will let you go...."" but it never stops! It is never satisfied until I feel like giving up and taking one way out or another (neither are good options by the way!).
I am a good person with a good heart and I know i would never do these things yet that spiral is so strong, so desperate and so persistent that I fear I may not be strong enough to fight it. Seeing others going through this same process makes me feel like im not alone, yet i fear that ""They/Them"" would have me locked away because of the ""Darkness"" within me.
When I was younger (18-19 yrs old) I first experienced this dark spiral and it terrified me so much that I contemplated suicide so that I could never hurt anyone like that! Thankfully I am alive but the OCD ""Darkness"" remains and it is a constant battle. How do you fight what you cannot see/touch/destroy?
Im sorry for this stream of consciousness post but im really trying to convey my feelings as best as i can. Thank you for taking the time to read this and thank you for (hopefully) accepting me as I am.
(ps: I am seeing a psych and I am medicated and for those two things i am forever grateful).

I posted in a couple of other threads but I decided to start a new one so I can get my thoughts together.
I started my career as an engineer.  I did that for 7 years, then became a project manager of engineering projects.  I have been doing that for 9 years.  I have been in my current job for 1 year.  I started my current job after my company made my previous role redundant in a restructure, and they redeployed me into this role.  I moved from a project manager role in a sector that I had lots of experience in, to a project manager role in a sector I have no experience in.
I think I have felt anxiety to some degree during my entire career, but it has been really bad since the start of 2020.  I don't have experience in the sector that I'm now working in, and I'm supposed to manage people doing work that I have no understanding of.  The company restructure that led to me changing sectors stripped the expertise needed to get work done.  Many times I have asked for a resource to do certain tasks, and the response has been 'Joe Bloggs used to do that, but he was made redundant so now it's the the project manager's job.'  I don't have the expertise to do what's required, so I feel like I'm being set up for failure.  My workload is too big for me to manage, and I'm falling further and further behind.  I've spoken to my manager about the issues I'm facing on my projects, said they will take time to resolve, and asked to renegotiate deadlines.  His response has been along the lines of 'Oh, you can still meet the deadline.  It won't take as long as you say to resolve the issue.'  My manager is disconnected from reality and has no appreciation for the effort actually required to get something done, and doesn't want to listen when I try to explain it to him.  So I have been working under immense pressure.
I have been having stomach cramps that make me run to the toilet 3-4 times a day, and I often feel like vomiting.
I have spoken to a psychologist and she said I don't have mental health issues.  She said I need to find a job that suits my personality.

Hey...
so, I actually only find myself at these forums when I need comfort. It‚Äôs been a little while and I‚Äôve been doing well.
I‚Äôve recently lost close to 18kgs - by trying, not because of anything sinister. Was super happy, going great. Im quite big, so any loss is wonderful. I started noticing change sin my body - as you do. Except, I felt a bit too hard and felt a lump kind of on my left side but more just under my rib cages (in that fatty area)
Rationally I know it‚Äôs fat, and there‚Äôs some on the right side, but the left side is what I‚Äôve focussed on again. So now, I‚Äôm that area, I feel like I can feel something wrong. I‚Äôm very gassy - as in, it gurgles and feels like bubbles, rarely any pain but when there‚Äôs pain, it‚Äôs gas.
I‚Äôm constantly focussed on it, so hyper aware that I feel things now on the same side but on my back. It tingles, it bubbles, it feels tight and also feels heavy. So when I lay on my tummy, it feels as if there‚Äôs something there.
 
UNTIL I DONT THINK OF IT.
If I‚Äôm distracted or with friends, 9/10 I feel not a thing. Can go for hours with nothing. I wake up with nothing until my brain tries to see if it‚Äôs still there.
i straight away go to cancer. Every time.
i have pushed so hard on that side to try and feel anything, done it to the other side too, and it all feels exactly the same. 
if I left my shirt, I feel nothing. Miraculously.
its like I‚Äôm so hyper aware that I‚Äôm feeling every tiny thing.
i went away recently, and it felt like it started to go. I came back and I was doing okay and then on Sunday (a week ago) my work bestie/mate passed away, and let me tell you. My anxiety is through the roof.
im so scared to see a doctor. The first thing they say is about my weight but then also I‚Äôm scared of the testing.
it feels like gas. The fat lumps I feel have been there the whole time but now I feel them more because of the weight loss. That‚Äôs when it all started. 

blurgh. I‚Äôm so over this.

Hi guys, 
I'm posting on here because my previous posts received support and I've found posting in here has helped me feel more connected to others. I was recently diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder and Generalised Anxiety Disorder. I'm seeing a psychologist for both and am dealing with ongoing pain due to tight muscles causing headaches etc.This pain and anxiety due to the pain has caused me to be getting 1-2 hours of sleep per night over the past week.
These headaches/pain tends to get worse at work as i have a high stress job (teacher) and i think i have begun associating my workplace with this pain. This morning was my first day back at work this term (Week 2) and I was so anxious that I was not able to go to sleep at all last night. I had constant tingling in my stomach/bum and legs plus racing thoughts. I did everything under the sun to go to sleep but I just couldn't (obviously this fueled my anxiety because imagine teaching a bunch of rowdy teens on an hours sleep). I've been awake since 9 o'clock yesterday and on my way to work this more i was in hysterics crying (I have never been this person so I was completely baffled to be so worked up). 
What I guess I'm asking is, how do I go about asking my psychologist to give me something for sleep/this anxiety as I cannot go through another sleepless night. I know psychologists can't prescribe medication but can she do anything? Is medication the right call? I feel like i've lost this battle that everyone seems to be doing just fine in and I'm somehow disappointed in myself for not being strong enough. I preach all day about how it's not weak to speak up but why the hell do I feel like a failure. 
Forever thankful for the support and feedback I receive here.

hello first time poster. Ive bee to the doc to get a mental health plan but im onto week 3 in waiting for the psychologist to ring me. We decided against medication but i didnt think id have to wait this long. Im so ready to deal with what im dealing with but i just cant on my own anymore.
We are in a very long process of renovating an old house. We have been living here 3 years now and i have got some fibro board tested for asbestos which came back positive. I have been having deliberating anxiety over how much we have been exposed to. For the past 3 years we have been living without care with fluffy raw edges of it right at our main door which gets slammed onto it, picked at, rubbed where we tuck a towel between the gaps to stop drafts. I have 3 small kids and i am petrified that we have been exposed to so many of those fibres. 
Since i have taken measures to seal the edges but that doesn't help the 3 years we have been exposed to it... i did some research on asbestos which has made my anxiety 10000 times worse coz no level of asbestos exposure is safe... i can't live the next 20 years worrying about getting a related disease. I cant eat properly, i cant sleep and my poor kids don't know what's wrong with me. I feel so stupid about it... any tips???

I just wanted to open up about how I‚Äôve feeling but I had no idea where to go. I‚Äôve never fully talked to anyone about how I feel. When I‚Äôve tried to people don‚Äôt seem to understand or I feel so damn judged. For example, I tried to open up to my really boyfriend but he decided he was entitled to tell all my other friends, proceeded to create a group chat after which I had a confrontation by two friends. So Ive convinced myself for the past few years that I am ok or whatever I‚Äôm feeling isn‚Äôt internalised, just a rough patch. Recently I‚Äôve been feeling so run down and upset, I don‚Äôt  know why. School is tough but that doesn‚Äôt account for why I just start crying or feeling insecure all of a sudden. I have always had an overthinking issue but it‚Äôs been taking over all my thoughts these past few months. Sometimes I genuinely just hate myself and feel like I have no purpose in life which scares the crap out of me. I constantly get annoyed or frustrated at the most small things. I‚Äôve held a lot in and been secretive, like coming out to my parents, my boyfriend which my parents don‚Äôt know about, my own insecurities- why I‚Äôve been eating less. I genuinely just feel tired of life and I‚Äôm only 16...
this all feels a little silly and scary since I‚Äôm not used to opening up but thank god it‚Äôs anonymous :)

I‚Äôve recently been diagnosed with adjustment disorder accompanied by anxiety. This all came about due to have tension headaches every day during work and the feeling of not being able to support my own head as my neck felt weak and sore. I didn‚Äôt think I was stressed about after talking to my doctors who referred me to a psychologist it seems that is the case due to ongoing trauma since I was a teen (I thought it was handling it). 
What I‚Äôm asking is, can anyone who has had a first hand experience with this disorder please let me know how you went about minimising the effects of the pain associated with it and what you did to help yourself feel better. 
I am going to a psychologist and she‚Äôs given me a sleep diary (I don‚Äôt sleep well, waking up 5-6 times a night) as well as given me some breathing techniques. These were all well and good while I was away from work but now that I‚Äôm back at work I‚Äôm worried the pain and headaches will come back. My doctor has given me pain medication but it makes me so tired I can‚Äôt function with it. 
Any advice would be great at this point, thank you.

Hi, my name is Jun, I'm one of those sensitive type. Sometimes I feel so alone cause I see and feel a lot, but no one really understands how I'm feeling and why I'm feeling this way. sometime when I'm alone by myself I would have some panic attacks and when I'm around people I feel like I'm being someone else.

I have come to the realisation that anxiety will always be part of my life whether I like it or not. No matter what I try and do to make it better it will be there like an old friend. The hardest part is accepting this and managing it. So at the moment I am trying everything I can therapy, exercise, medication. I guess trying to find what works. My question is what works for you and how do manage anxiety long term?

Hi All
I have suffered from the dreaded Health Anxiety since I was a young child.  I have had so many diseases; mostly terminal...that haven't actually eventuated to anything.  However; I have really suffered in the last two years.  It all began after losing my job due to severe shoulder injury.  In that time I have had tongue cancer, throat cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, bowel cancer, ovarian cancer........had numerous tests etc all ruled out any pathology.
I do realise that major stress in my life brings this on.  Five weeks ago I began a new job.  It was full on; 9 hour days of skype training....within two days I had severe thoracic and chest pain and decided I had lung or pancreatic cancer.  I spent three weeks doing this job with the constant fear gnawing away at me and making the symptoms so much worse.  I had a thoracic spine and chest xray two weeks ago which ruled out cancer of lung but did show a herniated disc...which is now being managed by physio etc.  Deep down I still think there is something more sinister going on...and of course that makes the pain worse.
I thought that was bad enough.  But then I heard about Van Halen dying from throat cancer and almost immediately my throat began to hurt.  I absolutely loved him....I was so gutted to hear of his death.  This throat business started four days ago.  I took a torch and had a look and almost fainted when I saw one tonsil is huge and red and the other side has a yellow spot and looks so weird.  I am now convinced I have tonsil cancer.  It hurts constantly;  my ear hurts...I am so terrified and so convinced it is cancer.  I know....I went through all of this a year ago.  My horrible mind is now saying ""cancer can sneak upon one; regardless of clear mri 13 months ago""....I am now back on that rollercoaster from hell...of googling and rechecking and rewriting my will....I seriously cannot live like this.  I hide it from my beloved teenage son as much as I can.  My fear is all about him; not me.  I cannot leave him until he is at least 18!
I cry all the time; I have panic attacks; I google stuff and almost faint...I cannot sleep or eat.  I KNOW what I am doing is totally nuts.  I have been doing this shite since forever...I feel a prisoner of my own mind.  I have seen so many professionals and had so many medications thrown at me.  Nothing works.  I am truly at my wits end.  
I have made an appointment to see my gp tomorrow and am terrified. 
thanks :(

Hi all,
I work in technology sales and have struggled with debilitating anxiety for over 15 years. It's a field where you are expected to be fearless, confident and tackle challenges. I recently started a new job which is intense and everyone is extremely confident and extroverted. The company is all about raising the bar, and getting comfortable with being uncomfortable. I have always had an overwhelming sense of dread when it comes to my job. I don't fit the sales mould - I am introvert, hate networking, hate social events, and like to stay in my comfort zone. 
A few years ago when I came out of university I landed in tech sales and was asked to do a presentation at a conference in my first 2 months. I suffocated with fear, had sleepless for weeks in the lead up. On the day my mouth was dry, I felt dizzy with fear, felt like I couldn't breathe and rushed through my 1 hour long presentation in 15 minutes. It was one of the most humiliating days of my life. 
Today, I still think back to that incident. I still suffer from debilitating anxiety and with my new job I have training coming up next week. Part of that training is the most dreaded thing I have encountered in my life ""Sales Role Plays"" which are done in front of a group. I have been losing sleep over this, neglecting my 12 week old child, and feeling overwhelmed with what I will be faced with next week. I have low confidence, and everyone else makes these things look easy with their confidence. In the past I have avoided things like this by pretending I was sick, or simply not showing up to activities that involve presenting or role playing. 
I am struggling to cope. I am having thoughts about quitting my new job already and am feeling overwhelmed, stressed and anxious beyond belief. This weekend is going to be a nightmare for me as I count down to the dreaded training starting on Monday as if I am counting down my last days on death row. 
Is there anyone who can help?

I‚Äôm just not me......I‚Äôm so bloody scared that I‚Äôm dying.  I try to get out of bed and get on with it however I‚Äôm really struggling ATM. I know I should try to focus on something else‚Äôs but I just seem to do that ATM.  I know many people who have had/have cancer and it really scares me.  I have tried counselling but never seem to click with anyone that understands me.  I have that horrible  knot in my stomach all day and often through up!  The only time I feel relaxed is if I have a couple of wines in the evening and funny enough the knot disappears.  I actually sleep ok but every morning  wake up with that anxious knot every morning  this does not go away until I get back my results.  I have a wonderful Mum, and girlfriend I discuss this with but I‚Äôm sure at times they are saying come on girl get your  self together.  My husband is not so supportive he just says you will be fine as always.  I just need someone to hold me tight and tell me all will be ok.  Cannot type anymore as I cannot see through the teats.  Thanks for  listening

Hello BB community.
So im posting to try and understand myself a bit more. 
I get very anxious and saddened when i hear about the abuse or exploitation of children. To the point where i feel almost uncontrollably edgy, and depressed.
most cases its watching movies. 
In artificial intelligence the robot child is Deliberately left behind in the forrest by his ‚Äòfamily‚Äô.
i cannot even bring myself to watch one of my kids movies - Onward.
most recently was a thriller called ‚ÄòTrue Story‚Äô which is based on a guy that murders his 3 children. I cried a bit, well maybe more than i care to admit.
other times its watching the news. I remember a segment that was presented by nuala hafner, where she broke into tears as i did about the segment. Just horrifying.
just today i learned of a person, that i have never met, that was sexually abused Almost daily from the age of 5 to her mid teens. I felt an instant pain in my chest and a sickening feeling in my stomach. 
Having not been a victim of abuse or exploitation, where does the feeling come from, and how is it best to deal with this?

Hello, I am a 22 year old male.  Recently after a tough time in life, I was diagnosed with GAD.  Been getting headaches for a few weeks already, went to get a CT scan done and a full physical examination with the results being negative for anything serious.  I am aware that anxiety can cause headaches, but is it normal to feel them even on days that you don't feel anxious?  And is it normal to get them so often daily? Recently these headaches has been causing me even more anxiety, because I am pretty worried that what if the Doctor missed something, or what if the tumours somehow grew after I had the CT etc and other thoughts like these.  
The headaches themselves are not terrible, definitely not ass bad as what I make them out to be, but they have been causing me a huge inconvenience in my daily life with how annoying and frequent they are.  Cannot really think or do much except worry if it is something serious.  Been adjusting my whole schedule and activity based on how bad the headaches could possibly get.  Tried to exercise and lead a healthier life, but the discomfort still doesn't seem to go away.  Been also feeling pretty down because my appointment with the psychologist won't be until a month later, and any further tests like MRI would need to be ordered, take more time to find an appoint and would cost a lot of money too.  
 
Im sorry if my structure is all over the place, but its been so frustrating.  I know deep inside that I could probably undergo every single test under the sun, and nothing would come up, but I cannot seem to convince myself that everything is okay and fine with me.  It is like the headaches are demanding to be felt.
 
Anyone has any experience with this? Thank you very much.

Hey everyone, 
bit of a back story for you to get an idea of my situation! I‚Äôve suffered severe anxiety for 8 years it first because me apparent during a very toxic relationship! I became so anxious that suicide cane to mind! I came out of that state with finding my own calmness for my anxiety! 
last week my anxiety became so bad that I convinced myself that everyone is out to get me this all occurred due to an argument with my partners family which might I add his brother and partner attacked me out of pure guilt deflection, as in they won‚Äôt blame themselves so they found the next best and it happened to be me! Since this has happened my anxiety is to the point where I cannot go to work, I have the anxiety feeling in my chest of tightness and heaviness, I cry all of the time, and I shake at times! 
cleaning and organising was my calming before but now even that‚Äôs not working! Would really love to hear some tips because getting a psychologist appointment soon is not happening!

Hi guys, about few months ago I went to get a diagnosis. The doctor told me I have depression and anxiety that has been ongoing and gotten worse now. He also made me a Medicare plan thing to see a phych. 
When I had my first session with the psych. She was really nice though I felt she downplayed my condition abit as I told her many days I am unable to keep up with daily appointments and do activities as I cannot get out of bed and always locked up in a room.
Now during this hard COVID times my Centrelink job provider has been very rude and pushy even when I told them I cannot work. They told me to see a doctor. 
I am able to see the doctor but I don‚Äôt know how to start the conversation on what I need. Could someone please help me on what I should bring up and what to ask the doctor for?
 
Thanks

I have been having anxiety for the past 10+ years. Usually comes and goes. However for the past 2 months my anxiety and worry thoughts have escalated and I feel like i am out of control. I lost my appetite so only eat because it is ‚Äònecessary‚Äô, i keep waking up every night at 3/4am with panic attacks or anxiety/thoughts, i cant focus and feel like i am not completely present.  
I have been on unpaid maternity leave for past 10months and due to Covid i had to start looking for new job. I was lucky to have found a job which I am meant to start in couple of weeks time. I should be happy but instead I feel like a failure, feel not good enough, questioning my decisions, feel like im incompetent, etc. in addition to that, I worry about my baby and how he will be without me. Mum will look after him but he hasnt seen her that often due to Covid restrictions so is not relaxed with her, plus im not sure if she will feel anxious too. I was hoping to do only 3days but due to finances and the type of job i need to do 4 full days instead. This means i probably wont see my baby at all for whole 4 days! Im anxious that we will loose the bond and that he wont be happy or that i wont be happy. I feel like a terrible mother. Plus I worry about the new job and learning new things with my current mental state. Additionally, i will work in health field so i worry i will catch the virus and spread it to my family! 
I really dont know what to do, i feel like i am being dramatic and ungrateful especially at this time but I just cant help my anxiety. It is killing me inside.

I have suffered with anxiety on/off for most of my teenage/young adult life. 
I often to get the usual symptoms when my anxiety is heightened - trouble sleeping, nausea, feeling on edge etc.
My partner & I had sex, after this happened, a rush of emotion hit me and I burst into tears and was convinced that I didn't love him anymore which was making me feel 10x worse because I really do!
I went to sleep feeling shitty but woke up a few hours later feeling very suicidal - which has never happened before. My head felt heavy and I didn't feel like I was in control of myself. I managed to get through this and went back to sleep. When I woke up, the feeling had subsided to the normal feelings of my anxiety. As well as this, the feeling of not feeling any emotions to my partner will not go away. He is trying to comfort me but I feel nothing. It's making me feel worse & I'm scared the feeling won't go away.
Is this a normal symptom of anxiety? 
Any advice or thoughts would be much appreciated

Hello everyone,
I‚Äôm currently 20 years old and haven‚Äôt had any paid employment (main source of my worries). I‚Äôm also a carer for both my grandparents and brother, as well as being a full-time student studying a double major in History and Anthropology/Sociology. At the moment I‚Äôve managed to commit myself to seven volunteer programs, two involving education for disadvantaged children, three museum/heritage programs and another two for cancer charities. Next year I‚Äôm going to study part-time while taking a Cert 3 in Health Administration to secure a temporary backup plan as a medical receptionist until I can (hopefully) secure a career in the museum sector.
Despite my volunteer experience for the previous three years, I can‚Äôt find a job. I keep applying for many on Seek and Indeed, however, I either receive no response or told my family obligations are impractical for employment (quite understandable, I suppose).
Anyhow, it just makes me feel completely inadequate that I can‚Äôt secure any form of employment and quite despondent when looking towards the future. I‚Äôm just so anxious about never getting a job and feeling as though I‚Äôm so hopeless at everything.
Sincerely,
Courtney D.

Hi everyone,
I'm having a horrible week, so just thought I would post to see how everyone else is going?
I'm having a hard time getting out of the shame spiral this week, but trying to remember this is only temporary. 
Anyway, hope others are well, happy to chat about anything.

Hi,

My boss's boss called me out at work in front of a small forum of colleagues. 
And this has triggered anxiety in me and a real loss of self confidence in anything work related - regardless of whether it has something to do with him or not.

But it gets real bad whenever it has something directly to do with him - a meeting, an email etc. I can't properly sleep in the days leading up to knowing I have a meeting where he will be in it as well. And even worse the meeting he called me out in with the same forum of people happens on a semi regular basis.

I keep telling myself I have to learn how to work under difficult bosses - not all are or will be the more ""people people"" kinda bosses, but finding it real hard to cope as the anxiety just rises so high at the thought of him.

Wondering if anyone else has been in this position? What did you do?

Apologies for this post. It might seem like a small thing, but it causes me lots of other worries like too much food, not having something defrosted to cook, not having any good ideas for meals, eating too much, food going bad in the fridge, too much leftovers, wasting food, too many dishes to wash, kitchen getting untidy, house getting untidy because of too much time spent in kitchen etc. etc.
I was born in the 70s to a Scottish born mum and an 1st generation Australian father. I grew up in an anglo centric family. 
I married an Italian lady. We have 2 daughters. We do a few things different to what a lot of Anglo Australian families would have done. For example, lunch is the main meal of the day for us. This means during the week we have a big pasta dish as soon as the wife and daughters get home from school (wife is a teacher). This will be around 3:30-4:00. This is considered to be lunch. It might sound strange to you, but in Italy lunch is the main meal of the day. It is also the same in a lot of European countries. In Italy shops and businesses will close in the afternoon for everyone to go home for lunch and siesta. Then for some jobs you go back to work after siesta. 
Anyways after the lunch meal at 3:30-4:00 we will then have dinner at around 7:00. This is often meat and vegetables or meat and salad. It is a more low key meal than the lunch. 
It means more cooking, more dirty dishes and more tidying up because of two big meals we have prepared. It probably sounds strange to some people? Especially those who grew up in anglo centric homes where you have a hot dinner as a main meal? Thoughts?

In 2017, the stress of my final year of secondary school twisted my anxiety into Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). My anxiety was originally stomach pains on varying levels, but IBS feels so much worse. Today, I still struggle with anxiety in combination with IBS and seeking various treatments such as the low FODMAP Diet. Has this happened to anyone else? How do you cope with having anxiety and something so uncontrollable as IBS?

This is my first post so Thankyou for reading. 11 years ago I lost my dad to a car accident, where his car ran into a tree after coming home from a nearby town. I live in a small town of roughly 3000ppl and if anyone knows living in a small town, when you hear those sirens tearing out of town you know something disastrous has happened. I remember this day as it happened yesterday. I heard those sirens tearing out of town, and knowing my dad was on the roads, my heart just sank and I had the most horrible gut feeling I‚Äôve ever experienced. This has caused major anxiety issues and to this day, every time I hear sirens around town I always go into a silent panic. Now days when siren go off people all over Facebook etc, post ‚Äòwhere are those sirens going‚Äô ‚Äòwhat‚Äôs happened around town‚Äô etc and as I don‚Äôt always read them, but I want people to understand that anytime they hear them, sometimes there is a family that‚Äôs about to be given disastrous news. And that to some people there is an anxiety attack associated with the sound. I know that it‚Äôs a way for as towns to stay connected but I also want people to understand that there is also another side to just ‚Äòkeeping in the know‚Äô Please help me I understand as I don‚Äôt know how to control my anxiety. As the anniversary of my dads passing  is near id like to bring this up, but im in two minds as I also do understand that it‚Äôs a way the town stays connected but it‚Äôs also people just being insensitive and stickybeaks.

I think I may be suffering anxiety. 12 months ago my son committed a minor offence through sending a 'sext'.  Police visited our house as a result. At the same time i was dealing with a very stressful work environment and had ongoing issues with recurring shingles. While my sons offence was dealt with as a warning and I felt like I dealt with the situation at the time, 12 months later I can not get the experience out of my head. I relive it daily. I feel like the whole situation has ruined our relationship as I just can not let it go. How long is normal for overcoming a stressful event?While the offence was minor compared to other people's experiences, it was not something I was prepared for. I have done a lot of soul searching the last year and want to find strategies to ensure the past becomes the past.

I just failed my first exams at univeristy. I get to sit a supplementary exam, but I set really high standards for myself, and I have never done this badly before. I feel like a complete failure - being smart is the only feature about myself I like. I want an excuse, someone to blame, but there are none. 
And I don't know anyone to talk to. I have given up on being honest with my parents, because it always ends with my parents talking about my problems to their friends and family without my consent. I then have to face these people, find out that they know things about me that I consider very private, and I feel awful and embarrassed, which I hate. I tell my family I haven't made many friends here because of COVID, but fact is I have never been good at making friends. I feel like I have nothing in common with other girls my age, and I just have no interests. 
I feel empty. And if these years are meant to be the best years of my life, I dread the future.
Wondering if anyone else has felt this way, and has any tips?

I was diagnosed with anxiety about 6 years ago (when I was 11 maybe?) and stopped seeing someone after I could sleep easily. I think I still have it and mild depression but I wouldnt want to see anyone because I never talk to my parents about personal stuff. 
Ive been dating someone for 8 months now and he lives close, has same interests as me, same personality type as me and super caring and kind etc. Ive had a few flings/relationships in the past (just high school ones I guess) and I was always the one that got dumped and that lead to really bad depression and thoughts like Im not good enough etc. Whenever I ask my now bf for reassurance he was always like ""you have to trust me, Im not going anywhere"" but recently he said we need to talk (Our communication is always good) but then said actually I dont want to because I know youll (me) get sad. I insisted he told me whats up and he said he never has really felt 100% with our relationship and that the relationship isnt as important and meaningful to him as me. 
I have final high school exams in about two weeks and I know from the past if someone really bad emotionally happens to me, I just go numb and can't do anything (which he knows about). I then freaked out and said can we wait until after my exams to talk about this in case we talk and things go bad and he said of course but he then said he never ever wants to break up and he loves me etc just his emotions are hard to figure out (he has pretty bad undiagnosed depression and was told by a professional his mind tells him he isnt worthy of happiness which is what I think caused him to think he doesnt feel 100% about the relationship). Also, Im the type of person to rely heavily on those close to me where as he is someone who keeps everything to themselves so I come off as extremely clingy which I think he has compared his emotions to (eg she misses me 24/7 and i dont). I want to talk about how hes feeling now because its caused my anxiety to get really bad and now Im more stressed about him than my finals but I also dont want to talk until after my exams in case the outcome is bad and I go numb? 
I asked him again today if he still likes me, wants to be with me etc and he said ""yes"" kind of bluntly. I told him my anxiety is getting really bad because my brains saying he doesnt but he just said ""you have to trust me"" like he usually does. I dont know what to do or how to cope with the stress of this and my exams.

Hi
im not sure what I‚Äôm feeling but it‚Äôs really starting to freak me out. Recently I have experienced the feeling of just freaking out . I would lay in bed ready to go to sleep as I slowly fall asleep I feel like my breathing is going slower and my head feels like it‚Äôs racing. I then just suddenly wake up and get myself up and I freak out . I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm freaking out about. I literally haven‚Äôt even closed my eyes for about 1 min and I feel it. I would reach for my phone as I need to see light . I stay up and I‚Äôm fine I then go back down and it happens again. As in sitting up both ears are hurting and my head a little. I have never had anxiety or panic attacks before so I‚Äôm really not understanding what‚Äôs going on. 
mum just worried as I can barely get any sleep cause I get scared of what can happen . I feel nothing but fine throughout the day it‚Äôs only as I lay down to sleep . Has anyone experienced this ?

I feel so lost and panicky and sad all the time. I recently moved out of my family home and suddenly have been overcome with so much sadness and anxiety and depression.

Hi, I'm new here and hoping to receive some good workable advise. I'm a 50 year old woman who has up until recently managed to play cool and hide in front of my anxiety and depression, until a few months ago i dropped my 'bundle' at a GP visit . I have been receiving help but.....I'm missing something
See life has to go on. I cant seem to be able to manage myself in public / work very well. I tend to be overcome by a wave of panic/ fear (something new to me) when I cant cope with something or a situation. Afterword when i reflect it seems easy to say walk away, but I kind of freeze. Does anyone have any tips for me to learn to manage to cope better? Thanks in advance

One of the things that causes me much anxiety is this guilt complex I have. I have this overarching sense of guilt about everything, even implausible things. A small example of this is if say, my housemate comes along and says they can not find their keys, my first reaction is to check my pockets and then go into my bedroom, I will feel like I must have taken them, even though I know I haven't. Another example of this is if someone is sick I will feel like it is my fault they are sick, even when I know that is irrational. When the news came out that the POTUS and his wife have COVID-19, I felt like me saying I hope he gets COVID might have caused them to contract the virus. Then I realised that is silly. I sometimes have anxiety attacks where I come up with thoughts that I have done something really horrible in the past and I will ring random people to ask them questions about some kind of event that I think has happened, and get frustrated when the person says that as far as they are aware that thing never happened.

So I have had severe health anxiety my whole life, but really ramped up since I had my daughter 16 months ago.
I have spent the majority of this year in a bad panic about various diseases (really far fetched) and just had a specialist appointment which confirmed I definitely do not have any of those diseases. 
My wife is getting fed up, and I was so hopeful that having the specialist confirmation would ease my mind, but I literally don't feel any better, just the thoughts are ""what if they're wrong"". 
 
I've been through soo many GPs and specialists etc all to be told im perfectly fine and it is somatic/mental health issues causing my repeat hypochondria.
 
Does anyone have any advice? Anyone been in the same boat and had any luck managing it? Really at my wits end here..

Hi everyone !! 
So let me give you some background info, I am in a very happy and healthy relationship with my boyfriend of 2 years and I honestly couldn't be happier. So backtrack a month when Stage 4 restrictions in Melbourne were announced, my mental health went way way way down hill. I was casually sitting there with my partner and the sudden thought came to my mind, ""Do you love him?"", I immediately felt anxious and became so distressed!! These thoughts have kept me up at night, has suppressed my appetite. I found myself constantly worrying about the thought even though I KNEW THE TRUTH!! I LOVE MY BOYFRIEND, it's as simple as that! But my mind, would find the smallest things to feed the intrusive thought! which definitely made it worse. In the first week I would constantly try to reassure myself, try to look up online ""Signs you are in love"", ""signs you are falling out of love"", ""are you in love quiz?"" EVERYTHING YOU CAN NAME, I DID HAHA. Within the first week I wasn't eating, I had lost 5 kilos due to this, which was crazy! I even vomited twice to due severe high levels of anxiousness. Like how can this one thought get stuck in your mind for a month!! But now this is where things get unbelievably hilarious and even crazier! I had made myself so sick with the thought if I love my boyfriend, that I even had the thought ""Am I thinking this because I am not even into guys?"" Bear with me, I know it sounds crazy. I know that these thoughts are literally just made up in my brain because I have no desire to be with women, I have nothing against lesbians or anything, everyone is free to do what they want, It's just not who I am. But it's so funny because my brain would then pinpoint every little thing out and just find reasons to back up the intrusive thought. I even thought about the times to when I was little and your family members, like idk Auntie or Mum would think a kiss on the lips to your girl cousin at the age of 4 is cute. Stuff like that would convince me that I could maybe be lesbian, in which I am not. I had never had this thought before this period of time and never second guessed my sexuality. I just knew and know that I like guys.
I don't know if it's OCD because I am obsessing over the thought and finding compulsions like looking up stuff online to help relieve me of the distressed and upsetting feeling! I did also have a rough family upbringing due to family violence. 
PLS TALK UP EVERYONE! I AM NOT ONE TO JUDGE
lets support eachother !! xx

Recently I‚Äôve been feeling really sad and lonely when I‚Äôm alone. I feel sad about how few friends I have, how that there must be something wrong with me because I can‚Äôt make more friends and can‚Äôt find a healthy, reciprocal relationship/boyfriend. I compare myself to every other girl seeing them as really fun to be around and interesting, and that I have no personality and no fun traits. 
I can‚Äôt seem to stop anxious thoughts about the future that I‚Äôll never find anyone and continue to be lonely for a long long time. Even when my housemates are out and I‚Äôm at home alone, I always find myself crying and feeling so lonely that I don‚Äôt have friends/boyfriend to see like they have.

Hi I am wondering if anyone can help me understand what is happening to me. This last 12 months has been a difficult with lots of home conflict mainly due to us both being exhausted by our jobs, family tradgedy and limited spare time. Communication started to break down some months ago. I find myself always worrying, then 2 months ago I ended up in ER with vertigo that lasted 7 hours. I was told it was inflammation in the eustachian tubes and given stemitil. A couple weeks after this I started having daily, up to 10 times a day lightheaded and dizzy feelings. I copied ok for the first week but now everytime it happens my heart pounds, my legs shake, my mouth is dry and it comes at anytime without warning. In the shops , at home, at work. I'm really feeling panicky and drained. I am scared when it happens. I wake with butterflies in my stomach and they come and go throughout the day. My heart, blood pressure have been checked and are ok. I am desperate to cope with the symptoms as I love life and doing different things. I feel this is making it so hard to relax and do the things I used to do.Thankyou for reading x

The past week or two I‚Äôve been totally ruled by my health anxiety. I started having a weak feeling in my left hand and arm and something about MND came on TV and now of course I have MND. I‚Äôve been experiencing muscle twitches and cramps/sore muscles, mainly in my calves and forearms. I saw my Dr in relation to this and he tested my reflexes, strength and pulses and all was fine. I keep trying to reason with myself but I just can‚Äôt shake this MND idea. It‚Äôs ridiculous. My Dr only prescribed medication to take when I‚Äôm having a really bad moment but the problem is I‚Äôm having these every day for most of the day.
Is anyone else experiencing this type of physical anxiety symptoms? This is all new to me as I‚Äôve never experienced this type of anxiety before.

In 2016 I felt the creep of what was later diagnosed as Generalized anxiety disorder cover my entire body. It was BAD. Poor sleep, weight loss, dry retching,  catastrophising, poor concentration, terrified I was going mad. My GP started me on medication and I attended counselling and slowly I started to feel normal again. The it happened again around the same time the following year. Not quite as violently this time but I felt I was back to square one. 2018 was a good year as it didnt happen. I had about a week of feeling pretty low and that was it. 2019 around the same time and it was back! Not as bad as 2016, but worse than 2017. I coped with counselling and an increase in  medications. By now I knew the nature of the beast and that I had to do whatever I needed to do to cope until it resolved. This year I had a couple of days where I thought it was going to come back, but then I was ok. Now though, there has been a change in my youngest sons life and I realize that I have probably had Situational anxiety all along because it is back. What scares me is that a lot of the counselling focuses on whether you have control over a situation or not or trying to remove triggers from your life. I can't remove the trigger and I have no control over the situation so I find it hard to think I can beat this again. I am using all my usual coping methods but worry that these aren't working. Anyone else have similar situation?

Hey all,
I've had this problem for maybe 3 years, although it seems to have gotten worse. It has its peaks and lows but it is extremely inconsistent.
The issue is, eating (or even if I don't eat) before going into a public space in which there is no escape, eg going on a long bus trip, going for a haircut, going to work ect. In these situations I feel as I loose control of the digestion of food, and that my stomach starts working in the opposite direction (sending food or whatever up) causing panic which in-turn increases the severity. This is a huge issue when I have to be at a specific place at a specific time, because I hate being late for work ect, but it is only minor if I am on no particular schedule. It makes it extremely hard to eat in public (at restaurants ect) and socialise and commit to things (ie if a manager asks me to work, and as soon as I agree the anxiety and nausea show up, if I just show up it will be only minor). The worst part is that it is unpredictable, and scenarios or techniques I use which seem to help it sometimes seem to work; don't work (eg, before getting on a bus to go drinking at a friends house, before getting on said bus it is quite bad, but generally when I get on the bus I goes away, but last time this didn't happen, even with breathing techniques and listening to music). 
When this anxiety first started, I could eat 30 mins before doing the things listed above, but now even if I don't eat I have this fear. I believe when I learned I can feel nausea and gag as if I'm about to vomit even if I haven't eaten for a while, or anything at all created this monster. 
Any advice? I took some sessions with a therapist a while ago, it didn't help that much. 
Thanks in advance! I'll add anything if I've missed it. I've been meaning to make this post for weeks.

Over the past 3 months I have been struggling with my mental health, resulting in constant low performance at work. I fear that I will soon be asked to resign or fired due to this.
Anxiety/depression symptoms are not new to me, I have been taking mild medication for this for a few years (no regular counseling), and it is not usually a problem. However a few recent events/circumstances seemed to have triggered a spiral that I am having trouble coping with.
I have been as open as possible with my manager as to my circumstances and why this is affecting my work. As my own efforts to deal with this was not improving my performance - I reached out to receive counselling.

I feel so scared of losing my job. My managers say they are supportive, and acknowledge that I am making steps to get better. But lately they have been very short with me, and haven't responded to the mental health updates they request. I have been in this job for almost a year, and I do enjoy it, but I am questioning if I should continue. I have a very strong sense that my managers are frustrated with my performance, or that they don't believe me. 

I don't know what to do.

Hi again everyone,

I'm having a pretty rough time tonight, but if I'm honest I've been struggling for close to 2 months.

I quick background is ive had anxiety offically for about 10 years or so, I see a psych on and off and am on anti depressants.

I live in regional vic, so lock down isn't helping, plus we are building a house and expecting our second child. Just to put some pressure on!

A fear ive always had is ill lose my job for one reason or another and now with my wife off work and taking on a lot of debt its compounding.

I know most of my triggers and I generally just avoid them and of i am triggered I can bounce back relatively quick. I had a server panic attack close to 2 months ago and am yet to bouncw back. I have small triggers that ruin my day, like today.

My psychologist has suggested I talk to my GP and and psychiatrist to potentially increase my dosage during this stressful time and look into if I have OCD.

Ironically enough the idea of another diagnosis and increasing meds is making me.anxious, but I'm keen to get on top of this for my son, my unborn child, my wife and also myself.

Thanks for reading, I just needed a rant.

Hello,
 
I have just signed up for this group! thought i'd talk about my struggles maybe someone can give me some in sight. Ever since I can remember ive had this huuuge fear of death. I am terrified to die to the point where 10 years ago it was making me have suicidal thoughts. 10 years later im still her thankfully, lived through the death of my pop and father in a span of a year. I always think that there is something wrong with me from skin cancer, to cancer caused by heartburn, cervical cancer, colon / bowel cancer every ache and pain oh must be cancer .. have a headache must be a brain tumor (thats is what my dad died of). I am 34 years old currently and have been suffering from this since I have been 20. And i feel its getting worse I just dont know how to deal with it. My partner is getting annoyed im always worried about my health, my mother doesnt like me talking about this kind of stuff with her and I dont really have any friends I can confide in. I have been putting off going to the doctor as I am terrified they will confirm what I am worried about. Is there anything I can do to alleviate this? Do I need to get medication or go see a physiologist? Can someone overcome health anxiety, i just want to live my life without a giant cloud hovering me all the time!
 
Thanks for reading my story, i know i'm not alone in this.

Hi all, this is my first time posting and I suffer from noise anxiety.
My noise anxiety only exists in my own home, I work in a noisy office environment and this is not a trigger at all. In the past we have had noisy neighbours, air-con units, loud music etc all causing me to think about when the noise will happen again and this causes me to worry about constantly. Even to the point of missing out on enjoying things because I need to try and control situations.
At the moment we are in our own house and the neighbours have a dog that barks ALL THE TIME. It‚Äôs sensitive to everything and anything and is causing me anxiety because we cant go out to our backyard without being aggressively barked at. The issue has been brought up with the neighbours and they are aware that the barking is disturbing me and my family but not a lot has been done. 
I'm tired of worrying and thinking the worst of what ‚Äòmight‚Äô happen. 
I'd like to hear from anyone that suffers the same type of anxiety and if they have tips on how to deal with it.
Thank you.

Hi all , I‚Äôm new here .
ive had anxiety for a while Now but usually keep it under control with a few bad days here and there. My main problem usually is sleeping, especially when I have to get up early. 
My job  is mainly afternoon work so this usually Isn‚Äôt a problem. Recently I got a promotion that required me to do early morning work and my anxiety blew up to the point I pulled out of the promotion because I wasn‚Äôt sleeping.
i went back to my afternoon work and everything was going ok until I was involved in a traumatic incident.
im now not sleeping anytime, the anxiety around sleep is killing me . I‚Äôm laying awake all night worrying about my job and the fact I‚Äôm not sleeping at all. I‚Äôve been off work for over a week and the dr said I need more time off. I‚Äôve got butterflies in my stomach all day .
im getting professional help but just needed to post somewhere and talk. I feel like there is no way out here and it‚Äôs never going to end .

Hi, so this is my first time posting and I see it‚Äôs about anxiety so I want to tell you how it feels for me to me.
My anxiety makes me feel like I‚Äôm trapped inside my mind, I wanna say things but yet can‚Äôt, I just want to be free.
I cannot see my friends, which causes everyone to get up and leaves
I cannot drive to the small shops down the road nor walk up a main road of a smaller town to an ATM just to get money out.
And whenever I go to reach my handout... all that I‚Äôm left with is a mindful of self-doubt.
Don't get me wrong I have other conditions, but anxiety is that one that I cannot learn to deal with. It‚Äôs subconscious, it‚Äôs never ending in my head, even when I know that I am safe, no matter what place.
I‚Äôve shed tears sitting in a car surrounded by pretty sparking trees covered in amazing glowing lights.
I cried because I wanted to be normal, I wanted win, I‚Äôm sick of having these fights with my anxiety, but I never win. I wanted to get out and look at these beautiful things but I couldn‚Äôt, it was crowded and I felt so left out within.
I wish I could explain my anxiety to people who either can cope fine, or do not have it.
as it‚Äôs not something I can shake, I am not weak, I am quite thick-skinned but anxiety is a disorder unlike my mother would tell me, alongside my other disorders.
But I look at her constantly with tears in my eyes, see she knows her and my father brought out one of my other disorders but all that they expect me to do is take their orders.
Not realising they‚Äôve ruined their child, not taking the time to educate themselves.
¬†
Not only is it ME that suffers from this, but also Borderline Personality.
I need help to cope, but it‚Äôs nowhere I can find.
- Anxiety is not pretty nor is it fun, I cannot take phone calls, I cannot work jobs around lots of people. I can‚Äôt do normal things. If anyone has been in this situation, I feel for you; as I‚Äôm still unsure what I can do.

Hi everyone, this is my first post and I‚Äôm very nervous sharing this but wanted to give it ago.
Since 2016, I had been with my partner who I love very much. We were only young when we got together I was 19 and he was 20. The beginning of our relationship was fun and great but then stressful times started arising as I felt like the weight was always on my shoulders to support him! He broke up with me just over a year into our relationship because another opportunity had arise and we got back together a week later. Since then I‚Äôve always felt like I haven‚Äôt been good enough and there‚Äôs always someone he‚Äôs talking to better than me which causes me believe  but I‚Äôm not good enough!
Then at the start of this year he was acting very distant! He said goodnight but from the bottom of my heart I could tell something was up. I tried calling multiple times texting and he was ignoring my calls and messages everything and he wasn‚Äôt home. To this day he still says he was ‚Äòjust thinking about us driving around‚Äô at 11.30pm for two hours. I then had no trust in him and was so scared of being hurt I ended it and regretted it the next day but he didn‚Äôt fight for us, he just walked away. 

 I was so upset and angry at myself and believe that what he says is true, that I argue too much and I‚Äôm never happy with anything
A few months ago he said he wants to work things out and fight for what he wants (me apparently). This whole time I‚Äôve been very hesitant I had my walls up because I didn‚Äôt want to go through it all again and be hurt and have someone walk away for the third time. This year I have achieved so much independently like moving out of home and buying my own brand-new house but still feel like I‚Äôm not worth anything and will never be good enough. 

We had an argument just over a week ago because I felt like he had stopped putting in effort which caused my anxiety to kick in and run for saftey - i had gotten back to my old self of not trusting him, starting arguements, picking at little things etc.
And again he walked away and said he doesnt want to keep going round in circles and its not going to work.
- I asked him to come over because i needed to show him something (my script) as he made a comment about my anxiety being ‚Äòself diagnosed‚Äô. I probably should have told him when we started talking again but i didnt want to be a burden or for him to think less of me - 
Now he feels responsible for everything, doesnt want to be with me but feels bad leaving me

Hi had shoulder pain for almost 3 weeks and because it's in my left shoulder and left forearm I worry it's heart related. I more my shoulder and it doesn't hurt so I don't know where the pain comes from I'm worried it's referred pain.

When you were growing up, what would happen to you if you didn‚Äôt do as you were told, or just totally ignored your parent‚Äôs orders? Did your parents punish you severely?

Hey everyone, I have never reached out before as I have always felt I could handle it on my own. However lately I have been struggling to deal with the anxiousness. Long story short. I am a female in a same sex relationship, around a year ago I was cheated on. 
Ever since then, at random times I will get flashbacks of the moment going through my mind and I will get really upset or down. I feel like I can‚Äôt control when this happens but it could be at anytime, I start to doubt everything and then think did I make the right choice by trying to keep on with the relationship. 
My partner has recently become more busier with work and is staying out really late or spending all weekends. 12-14 hours a day not home, I will be at home trying to keep busy (doing the housework, walking the dog, watching sport) trying to do what I like to keep busy. But with doing all of that, I still lay in bed and feel concerned. I start biting my nails, get a huge headache and the biggest one of all is the stomach cramps and churning of the stomach (grumbling). On a normal day I will be knackered and fall asleep 10:30pm ish, but on nights where I am on my own I am up until all hours of the morning just constantly stressed and mind running. The last time this happened I woke up to a completely different story. I think this is why I‚Äôm too stressed to fall asleep on my own. 
I‚Äôm not sure if this is common or if I am just overthinking it, but I‚Äôm starting to realise that it may be worth talking to someone or seeing a GP to sort out a mental health plan. I just don‚Äôt want to sound stupid or feel like my situation isn‚Äôt worth it.
I appreciate the time and effort you take to read this, and any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 
Ta,

Hi,

I'm new to this and not sure where I even start, I have never spoke openly about my struggles and just stay in my own head,. It's like I am wearing a daily facade. I'm a man in my 30s and feel like I'm not where I should be. Lately I've been getting headaches in the back of my head like a pressing feeling. I get headaches but nothing like this, when I'm feeling over whelmed my heart rates kicks up and I get tight feeling in my chest. Is this a panic attack?

I'm not even sure where I start, I've done mental health course for my work and find myself trying to treat my self in my mind. I have solutions, but I have barriers. I feel stuck in my position where I am for a certian time frame. 

How do I start this journey, I don't feel my doctor would be private as at times I feel controlled. 

I feel I'm being criptic. But I feel this is a start. 

I'm struggling and don't know where to from here.  I need guidance.  I'm not ready for professionals yet

Hi everyone,

I was hoping to get some advice on whether or not having it on your health record that you've seen a psychologist/psychiatrist would affect future job opportunities?
A lot of companies these days have you sit a full medical exam before offering employment, and this often asks about mental health history.
My partner is struggling with anxiety and depression, but is hesitant to seek professional help, as she doesn't want it to affect her chances for future employment opportunities.

I would be very grateful if anyone has any information or advice.

I have been working the last 2 years as a medical receptionist for a small business. Recently I decided that I couldn't survive any longer on part time pay and took a new job in the exact same field, just a different company. 

To say this has put my old job in perspective is an understatement. My old boss started their business with no prior knowledge of the industry. It is clear that policies and procedures that should legally be put in place, have not been at my old job. Therefore at this new job I am feeling very overwhelmed. They are expecting me to know a lot of these policies and procedures for privacy and billing etc that I've never had to use before, as clearly my old work was doing some things a bit off-book. Also this new company does so many more extra steps and I'm feeling like I'll never remember all this info. 

I'm slightly regretting the move even though its only my first week and I'm going to be better off money-wise. I know it will feel uncomfortable for a while as I don't really fit in and don't know the work but I'm wondering how long its going to take. I have given myself a coldsore from the stress, and when I get home from work, I can't stop going over what mistakes I may have made that day no matter how minimal it is.

All the staff have been lovely and helpful but I just feel so out of sorts and so uncomfortable not knowing my role!
My family keep telling me to stop overthinking because I obviously got the job for a reason, and I'm not expected to know everything straight away, but I put a lot of pressure on myself.

How do you cope with health anxiety? I‚Äôve had so many tests and have all come back normal, yet I‚Äôm constantly feeling light headed..  I have so many symptoms with it and it doesn‚Äôt make it any better because then I‚Äôm just making up crazy scenarios which leads to panic attacks which leads to me feeling even more crappy.. it‚Äôs just one vicious cycle. 
I‚Äôm constantly thinking about what my kids would do all day if I died, who would find them? Who would feed my 8 month old? 
I haven‚Äôt felt normal in 3 years since this all started. 
I want to feel normal again. I feel if this keeps going on I‚Äôm going to lose my battle.

Hi guys, i am trying to be kind to myself and acknowledge that this is a problem I should talk about, even though I know this may not be as serious as others are experiencing.


I am a 32 year old Sydney resident for at least 5 or so years now. I have frequently experienced loneliness throughout my life, as well as GAD and some minor depression, and have had few relationships and/or encounters. The last serious relationship I was in was 2 years ago and I have not dated or indeed been intimate with anyone since that time until very recently. 


For all intents and purposes I have a good life. I live in a nice suburb, in a nice apartment, have kept my job as a legal adviser during COVID and otherwise am comfortable. 


Logically I have a good thing going, yet I constantly battle with loneliness and isolation. I have very few friends in the city, and tend to get very nervous and/or fatigued trying to find/engage in new activities.


Recently, I became friends with an amazing girl who has some of her own mental health problems. We became close friends and have been intimate at least twice. However she has since expressed that whilst she loves me as a friend, she is not interested in pursuing a relationship. I knew this when we were intimate and had resigned myself to this, but through helping her through an episode recently and through not having much in the way of other close relationships, I have fallen for this girl. I have expressed this to her, and she has let me down gently. I obviously don‚Äôt blame her, and do not expect that she will reciprocate my feelings simply because I have them, but nevertheless it has triggered me to have a strong bout of loneliness, which is bordering on depression.


Most importantly, my inner critical voice has stirred up as a result, and I am becoming very unkind to myself about my perceived failings in my romantic life. 


Recently I have been taking steps to try and recognise these negative thought patterns, but every time I think about this girl, and the fact she has started dating others, I feel an immense sadness, which sometimes triggers off these thoughts.


I guess my question is: should I do something within these sad moments, or should I continue to allow myself to feel these sad moments to help process the pain. I‚Äôm concerned that whilst I should allow myself to feel sad without judgement, if I don‚Äôt actively take steps to combat these moments, that it may turn into a cycle of self pity.
Thanks

Hi, 
Just wanted to ask for some advice from someone who might have some experience with this or have been in a similar situation. 
Over the past few months, I have rigorously applied for internships to a variety of different companies/businesses in the hope of gaining some experience during my university degree. I'm graduating in a years time and ever since COVID hit, this has brought me a great deal of anxiety. I was so scared of graduating without any practical experience, especially in a time with low employment prospects. 
I recently did an interview for an unpaid internship which was advertised as 3 months in duration. The job advert requested someone that could commit to around 25 hours a week. This unpaid internship is not part of my degree, just something I wanted to do on the side for experience. 
Today the man called me and offered me the position, however expressed that he is changing the role to 6 months unpaid. I financially can not afford this and the fact that I will have to commit over 600 hours unpaid is making me extremely stressed and sick. I know I will  regret turning down the opportunity, especially if I don't get an offer from anywhere else. My parents have told me to express this to the recruiter, but I'm scared he will replace me. I'm considering telling him later on down the track, but I don't wan't want to disappoint or inconvenience anyone, let alone jeopardise using this experience for my resume when I finish. 
Any advice? 
Thanks

Hi everyone,
I was very hesitant to post anything here because even the idea of discussing my problems is giving me anxiety. I have been suffering severe anxiety for several months (I have had anxiety and depression for most of my life) including anxiety attacks and strong, intrusive thoughts. I was bullied for most of high school and in year 9 when I was pushed by one of these bullies I snapped and assaulted him with a weapon. Afterwards I was sent from the police station to mental health suicide watch for 3 days. I have been able to move on with my life more or less but my anxiety over the event has resurfaced recently.
I was sentenced to probation and counselling but I could never reconcile the event or how I really feel about what happened. I wish I could of sworn at him or stood up for myself, anything other than attacking him. I have anxiety about thinking about how I SHOULD think about the incident. The event was mentioned in the local paper and a news article is still online. I have intrusive thoughts and compulsions about reading the article or otherwise searching for information about the event. I tell myself that I shouldnt feed my compulsion but another part tells me I should read it. Which gives me more anxiety.
I have suffered with anxiety, depression, autism and suicide attempts my entire life. In a perfect world I would like to seek treatment, but I have had bad experiences with useless psychologist and medication that has given me side affects. I have no support network, my father is suffering bad PTSD and my mother has anxiety, I feel like telling them about my problems will only exacerbate theirs, and that's the last thing they need. 
Thank You for reading, I hope that any answers given in this page could also help others.

I had a week off work on sick leave due to depression. I came back to work for a week and felt great. Then I had a tough time again mentally and am now on another week of sick leave.

Does anyone else experience debilitating physical symptoms of anxiety? One night I ended up in the hospital due to constant heart palpitations and tachycardia. I had bloods and numerous ECGs done and was told it must just be anxiety since nothing came back. But I can't shake the feeling that something is seriously wrong. I get intense palpitations where it feels like my heart stops and restarts over and over again. This sends me into a panic and my heart races, I feel sick, I tremble and just can't calm down. The fear of getting heart palpitations and the associated panic has meant that I literally can't focus on anything else besides how I'm feeling. I don't even like to go for a 10 minute walk because as soon as I feel my heart rate increasing, I freak out. I can't sleep, I can't study, I can't do anything. At night especially I get this really weird sensation in my stomach, that feels like its full of air/ churning like I'm hungry even though I'm not. It makes it feel like its difficult to breathe and it makes my heart beat more obvious. All I want to do is sleep and I can't even do that. I am seeing a psychologist and I have gone back to the Drs numerous times because I'm not convinced something isn't wrong. I'm getting more blood work, another ECG, and am going to see a cardiologist hopefully for peace of mind. This is controlling my life and I don't know how to go on.

Hi everyone I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôm not alone but I could do with some advice & support.
anxiety has been a problem on and off all my life but I always managed to pull myself together, now days I‚Äôm anxious, nervous all day and ride the waves of panic but it‚Äôs getting harder to pull myself together with natural ways, I‚Äôm calling my doctor few times a week, had blood tests and ECG that all came back normal and my doctor is wanting me to take two different medictions, I‚Äôm just too scared, scared of all the what if‚Äôs, scared it will make me worse, I don‚Äôt drink, don‚Äôt do drugs I don‚Äôt like that ‚Äúout of body‚Äù feeling. I‚Äôm always on edge waiting for something bad to happen, always thinking the worse (heart attack, stroke, Brain aneurysm, cancer)
I have a good support around me but they are getting tired and abit frustrated with me.
I have a canceller who I was seeing regularly for more depression and I‚Äôve just made a appointment to speak with her now with the anxiety
Sorry it‚Äôs long but I guess what I‚Äôm asking is anyone else have health anxiety but scared to take medication and nothing else seems to be helping?
I‚Äôm feeling alone,lost and like this will never get better I‚Äôm losing hope and feeling crazy

Hello all,

I havent been on here for a couple of years now. I suffered quite bad GAD for around 2 years and thankfully through different techniques- seeing a psychologist and getting into healthier lifestyle patterns I managed to get pretty on top of it for the last couple of years. 

However, I recently found out I am pregnant and my anxiety has come back in FULL FORCE. This was a planned pregnancy but it happened a lot quicker than I thought it would. I am very grateful we have had no issues but I just cant believe how bad my anxiety has spiked since finding out. 

I have Emetophobia (fear of vomit) and I always knew there would be the chance of morning sickness but in my na√Øve self thought ""ah I will deal with it when it comes"". Now I am pregnant its an ALL consuming thought day in day out. I am halfway through 6 weeks - which is meant to be the week morning sickness starts and, although I havent really felt nauseous, I cannot stop thinking about it. I have also been really tired, which I know is a normal symptom, but again can't help this making me feel anxious as well!

I am constantly on edge, my body is shaking every time I try to relax and my thoughts are all consuming. I keep googling numerous things online, which I know is bad, and that also has made things worse. I have been breaking down the last few nights thinking things like ""maybe I shouldn't of done this"" or ""I am not ready for this but I can't get out of it now"". This is all to do with control and its made me realize the way I dealt with my anxiety a couple of years ago was probably a form of taking control of my life and now its come back to bite me as I feel totally out of control now and its  reared its ugly head again.

I just wondered if anyone else had these feelings during pregnancy and what you did to overcome them? I keep thinking oh hopefully this will pass when I get into the second trimester, but thats not for another 6 weeks and I do not know how I will cope day in day out when I can barely function and its only been a week! At work its the worst because no one knows and I just dont want to talk to anyone. Then on the weekend I just want to hide away at home and not leave the house but I also know this isnt healthy :( :( :(

Hi everyone, this is my first post on here. Ive been struggling with anxiety for about 8 months.

I needed help so I started therapy about 6 months ago and started taking medication around 3 months ago. I‚Äôm still struggling and lately it‚Äôs most days I feel like anxiety is winning, not me. 
ive tried all the breathing techniques, I‚Äôve even tried yoga and am currently trying to be motor physically active because I really used to enjoy that. 
does anyone have any tips to help control anxiety? Any help would be appreciated. I guess it helps to know that I‚Äôm not alone

My Pandemic VS Social Anxiety Opinion 
I will be honest that during the corona virus pandemic it has really shown me that isolating at home hasn't bothered me because before this, I have always been a home body and I have made no effort before this pandemic to socialise with people for my own lifestyle due to, what I now believe is because of social anxiety, and the mask wearing has been surprisingly comfortable to talk with as it disguises any embarrassment or awkwardness I would feel. Now, this just means that when restrictions ease again I feel I have alot of work ahead of me to try and open myself up to social opportunities with others. By this I mean to hopefully be willing to chat about peoples days and get to know them on a more personal life basis. What do you guys think on the mask wearing and isolation restrictions in 2020?

Hey everyone,
Just wondering if anyone has some ideas or suggestions to help me out.
I'm a 30 year old woman, currently staying with my parents while I'm stuck here during the pandemic. Since the start of the year I've fallen back into old eating disorder patterns. I've been well for the past 8 years, though admittedly the past 2 years have been up and down with restricting. I'm on a mental health care plan for depression, and have been working through things a bit with my psychologist, however a couple of weeks ago we decided it was best to get my GP involved as things haven't been improving.
I saw my GP, and he wanted me to make a commitment to stop purging (such a shitty behaviour that I hate), and to make a partial disclosure about the issues I have with eating, so that I don't have to 'put on a show' in front of my parents that I am eating normally. 
So basically, I am seeing my GP again on Friday, and I have managed to achieve neither of these things I committed to. I am worried about what he will say/do next, and also just feeling really physically exhausted and tired of everything.
Does anyone have any suggestions for how to talk to family about eating issues without feeling like you're a massive disappointment to them? Or just general words or reassurance?

First time posting,
I've just been diagnosed with anxiety and am seeing a mental health worker next week. For the last week I've been paying heaps of attention to my swallowing and it feels like I think so much about it I forget how to do it and then it feels like I can't swallow and I might choke. That triggers my anxiety even more and then it starts to feel like something is trying to come up almost like I might be sick but without actually feeling sick. Then it all flows from there and I get an even worse choking/something coming up feeling and the trembling hands and light headed ness kicks in. Does anyone else experience this and have any tips on combating it?
Thanks :)

Hi all
I started a thread a when I first came on here called 'can't relax' but even then I didn't mention one of my biggest issues. I have a phobia around blood pressure. I don't even like saying it or seeing it written! but I had to put it in this thread title to see if anyone can relate / advise.
I get so anxious when the dr is going to take it that it's always high and so it got to a point last year where she encouraged me to take it myself at home, and by doing that we were able to decrease the meds I was on for high bp. (dr says I have 'significant white coat syndrome)
Anyway I haven't taken it for ages as it still makes me anxious even doing it myself and meanwhile had put on some weight and spend a lot of time worrying about my bp. I am seeing a psychologist and while I mentioned this in my first appointment we haven't really addressed it so I'll bring it up next week cos it's clearly a) obviously not going away by itself (the worry about it) and b) quite a big worry at the moment. 
I know I need to talk to her, lose weight and walk more, and take it more regularly.
Anyone dealt with any like this ridiculous phobia?!?

Hi there,
I‚Äôve suffered anxiety all of my life, but the past month it has gotten out of control. I have seen my dr and my meds increased and am seeing a psychologist.
Sometimes I just need to hear it from people that know what it feels like, that I will get through this, and I will feel myself again. It‚Äôs not always easy to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 
Will I get through this?
Will I be ok again?
I really need hope that life will be sunny once again.

Hey I‚Äôll try make this brief.
ive suffered from an anxiety disorder for some years now, and for a large period of that time I suffered from some insomnia too.
some nights were better then others, some were terrible, but it was always there. I tried all sorts of techniques, some could be helpful. I know for a fact the only thing keeping me up was my anxiety about being able to fall asleep. It was rarely other general anxiety keeping me up. I found what worked best for me was just resting and telling myself ‚Äúrest and better then nothing ‚Äú I‚Äôd feel calmer about the situation and fall asleep eventually.
anyway I noticed it had been quite a while since I had these problems. After years of it bringing me down everyday I noticed I don‚Äôt even think about getting to sleep anymore. I‚Äôd gotten past this issue in my life. 
just realising this though sparked my anxiety, the anxious thought of  ‚ÄúCould it start happening again‚Äù it kept eating at me all day. I tried to push it away tell myself it‚Äôs an unhelpful thought but there is where I lose the battle. It was already to late and it happened. It kept me up all lastnight I don‚Äôt know if I slept at all, and all night and now this morning all these worried thoughts come at me ‚Äúwill this be a thing again‚Äù ‚Äúwhat if I can‚Äôt sleep anymore I won‚Äôt be able to go to work‚Äù even just looking at anything now my anxiety will find a way to relate anything to the ‚Äòfact‚Äô that I can‚Äôt sleep anymore. 
I just feel so powerless to the anxiety sometimes. I‚Äôm not in control, I see the problem but I‚Äôm struggling to take that control back. I am currently seeing a psych and that helped with understanding a lot but I‚Äôve clearly got work to do. Just hoping people maybe had an input or some advice?
thanks!

Hello,

I was wondering if anyone could give me some advice.
Recently I have been noticing that I have been finding it harder to control my worried thoughts. I catastrophiser about the future. Since about April or so I have always been worrying about not being able to get a job after I graduate from uni and that all my peers are way better than me. I know that this is irrational and that I am probably at the same standard as my peers but I can't stop thinking about it. I have planned for the future if I don't get a job and constantly think about where I am going to live if I cannot afford to rent or buy a house. I also wonder whether my brothers would take me in if I ended up living on the street.
I also stress that my friends do not actually like me and that they only invite me places because they do not know how to get rid of me.
Can anyone give me some advice please if they have been in a similar situation?
Thanks!

Hi BB crew!
 
Where do I start, I've got OCD coupled with panic disorder and CPTSD. Add to that social phobia, health anxiety and agoraphobia when my anxiety is really bad. I've experienced panic attacks for almost 2 decades. It's exhausting.
There were many periods of time where I went without medication just because I felt like I was ""giving in""... I absolutely know this isn't the case. It's more societies label on antidepressants than anything else.
Anyway I'll try to not draw this out. I finally began one SSRI in 2010 after my father passed away. It gave me pretty full on side effects for the first week but after that, absolutely amazing. I couldn't believe I'd not taken them sooner and got my life back! I had a HUGE reduction in OCD and panic attacks. I eventually stopped these a few years later. Then went without again for a period of time. Started these meds again in early 2016 and didn't quite work the same. In fact I was on a dosage that was far too high.
I've since reduced the dose right down to try another SSRI BUT I'm absolutely terrified of the side effects. I'm so tired of being afraid and knowing it's not exactly LOGICAL to think the way that I do. Yet here I am haha. I think my fear centers around side effects. Then what if it DOESN'T work?! Or better yet what if it does work and I'm so upset with myself for not taking them years earlier. I know it's best not to let the mind wander.
Anyway I'm looking for tips on how to overcome this huge fear of taking meds. I'm even fearful of taking things like vitamins at times. I'm one of those people that I feel has a legitimate chemical imbalance and requires store brought serotonin. So while talk therapy helps, I need to start these meds! Anyone else have an illogical fear of medications? How did you work through it? Did you overcome your fear and find the med actually helped?
 
Thanks in advance :-)

Hello, I need advice on how to cope with anxiety and depression relapse. recently there has just been a bombardment of things in my life (on top of COVID) we're moving house, my custody arrangement is changing, my rabbit died, I have 4 assessments due and my best friend is leaving school. normally this would be manageable however this is all in one week. I have been experiencing physical symptoms of stress and anxiety and a relapse into depression. I was wondering if anyone could have any advice on how to cope with this, I do not want to relapse back into the mental health issues I had in 2019, I get worried about having a nervous breakdown (even though I have never had one, my old therapist thought I could have some slight hypochondriac tendencies, I get worried about any physical symptoms I might have and I associate them with a nervous break and I think I should check myself into a hospital even though it is not that bad). I apologies for the rant-like format of this post, I hope it was readable.

Hi, 

I've been on anxiety medication for about 8months now and I have seen a therapist multiple times. I got to the point where I thought I was going to be ok on my own, but now I'm worried that it's happening again. When I do something wrong at work, with my family or with uni my head gets into these really dark places. All I can think about is the stress I'm feeling for these things. How much better it would be if I wasn't alive anymore, so I can just get out of my head. I have a really supportive family but I feel like they're sick of hearing about the same things over and over again. I feel like my problems are so insignificant. I know what I need to do to feel better, but it's like I don't have any energy. Just the thought of exercising or doing something other than studying or watching mind numbing shows on Netflix is exhausting. I'm feeling numb. Usually I cry a lot, but it's like I've got nothing left in me. 
I don't know why I'm on here, or what I'm asking for. I looked through my contacts and didn't feel comfortable telling anyone this, so I think it's better I do it this way, anonymously. I just want to tell someone.
I know I have so much to be grateful for, but I think I don't deserve any of it. There are people out there who would do so much more with my education, family, friends, privilege than me. It's not fair on them that I have all of that and still think about how nice it would be if I could just shut my brain off, and be done here.

Please can someone give me their perspective or advice of sorts. I am 26 years old and it has only dawned on me once I turned 25 that I may be suffering from Social Anxiety. I hate it. I don't know know who to talk to about it. Today I went to put make up on which feels like such an effort and when I have it on my face, why do i feel that when people talk to me they are looking at my moustache area which gets me realllllyyy self conscious about it and then I end up getting agitated in front of the person and hate them for it because I would never do that to them. And then I am worrying because of my lack of a social life that I have missed out on dating and getting a boyfriend which gets me nervous because when I do get one, I will be thinking that this is my first boyfriend, i have never been kissed and that I am only ever going to have one boyfriend in life. I just hate this all

Does anyone ever constantly hear voices from their past?
I often find my mind wandering back to my childhood or my past.
I hear my parents being angry or unhappy. It was very common when I was growing up. There were lots of arguments about things. Money was a common one. My parents didn't have a lot of money and it caused lots of shouting matches.

Good Morning,
I'm continuing to struggle with the anxiety over a potential HIV incident I had almost 3.5 years ago. It was a very low risk or no risk accident, but I can't seem to move on from it. 
I eventually went against all doctor/parents etc... recommendations and answered my anxieties questions late last year and had a full test done. All negative. This helped move my anxiety for a small period, but it has returned. At the moment - I go through periods of questioning the results, looking for symptons etc... I just can't seem to move on and forget the word and the incident. I am on medication to help, but still that word is in head, and I'm struggling to deal with it every day. 
Is there any suggestions, help, support anyone can give. I guess deep down I believe the results, but my anxiety will not let me move on from the them.
Thanks in advance

Hi I‚Äôm new to all of this and would appreciate any advise. I‚Äôve been suffering from panic attacks on and off since about two years ago when I Randomly  got really sick then my vision started playing up only for me to start googling and thinking I had a brain tumour. I had so many tests done, MRI, brain scans, eyes tested several times and no one could find what was wrong with me. I feared dying and it got to me so much, I found out I have an open valve in my heart, which scares me to think I‚Äôm going to have a heart attack every time my heart races also my neurologist  put me on my first antidepressant after suffering chronic headaches and neck pain which seemed to block the neck pain but after 6 weeks it started to me with my head, I stopped taking the antidepressants then found out I was pregnant. As my pregnancy progressed everything seemed to be starting to ease a little, I was a lot happier, turns out I needed glasses for my eyes even though no one could find that. I‚Äôm now 4 months postpartum, yes I did suffer the baby blues at first then a panic attack here and there, my biggest fear is the heart pulpitations and my body seems to trembling when it happens which makes me think the worst is about to happen. I struggle to sleep when this happens and feel as every time I close my eyes and just get to sleep I‚Äôm going to choke or stop breathing and wake in a panic. I do struggle with this. I recently got the merina put in and since Sunday I have been suffering panic attacks everyday, trembles at least 4 nights and during the day, lightheadedness and crying a lot, it‚Äôs getting taken out on Wednesday, one of the doctors swears it‚Äôs nothing to do with what‚Äôs happening but I think it does. I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind right now and I just want the help to get back to my happy self for my family and my beautiful baby.

When I was growing up, my parents would often call me stupid.
I just seem to remember it so often.
They were very angry people. They said it so much.
It has affected my adult life quite a bit. I have problems making decisions. I often over think things. I can still hear my parents calling me stupid.

Hi there 
I have GAD and usually can manage it pretty well apart from racing heart insomnia and co aren't worrying thoughts but day to day I'm ok. I'm a vet nurse and at my clinic all my team have quit over the last couple of weeks it has been quite a shock,  I have applied for a new nursing role and I got it it's at a specialist clinic so the role is a much bigger one than I have done before and I will be on the surgery tram. I have huge imposter syndrome going on and I am in complete panic mode part of me feels like I should just stay in my sage job where I know the role and can walk to work although we will be getting a whole new team as most staff have left so who knows what that will be like. I am filled with so much anxiety of starting at this new clinic I have even told them I have anxiety and they  have said give it a month and see how you go. I am worried I will start there a d regret leaving my safe comfortable job.... but maybe I should push myself..... I just know where my limits are ..... Maybe safety is best for me. I'm scared of making the wrong decision ....... I can't even think about what's it going to be like on day one of the new job .... it just feels me with dread not excitement....

my social anxiety has become worse during covid, being isolated and being anxious in general seems to have made me feel incredibly overwhelmed at the prospect of leaving the house, and i even feel like keeping up relationships with friends and family a daunting task. 
i can tell the withdrawal is also exacerbating depression/suicidal thoughts.
does anyone have any tips? meds? coping mechanisms? would love some help.

I have anxiety and panic disorder 

I just got transferred in my job and im having almost all day panic attacks

My panic anxiety comes in form of severe nausea and to try and avoid it by creating pain such as digging fingernails into other fingrrnails and into gums

I feel this provides distraction but I think it also feeds the anxiety as fighting it

Do others have similar reactions?

Hello,
I have been struggling a bit lately with catastrophising my future. I am half way through my studies and I constantly am thinking that I will never get a job or that other students are way better than me (which I know I am probably on the same level as everyone else). I have thought about alternatives to if I never get a job after uni and wonder if I will ever be able to get a house or get a job that will support me well enough. Every time my friends joke and stuff about getting married and having kids, I always just think that that is never going to happen to me and that no one would want to be with me.
I also feel as though my friends are only friends with me for the sake of it and that it is just because I am there and they don't actually want to be my friend but they don't know how to cut me off.
I know that these thoughts are irrational but they just flood my mind and its all I can think about and I always turn situations into negatives.
Has anyone else ever thought like this, and if so how did you combat these thoughts?
Thank you!

Hi all
Since late June 2019 I have been experience heart palpitations EVERYDAY, CONSTANTLY!
By palpatations I mean a prominent heart beat- my heart rythm/pulse rate is normal.
i find lying on my right side in bed uncomfortable and it brings about a dizzy feeling. In the last week lying on my left side now leads to a really prominent heart beat in my ribs. 
a few months ago I got check out my a cardiologist, ultrasound, ecg, stress test on treadmill, 24hr holter monitor and everything came back fine. So they say it is anxiety.
Has anyone else experienced non stop palpitations for this long??? 
I really am looking for some suggestions on how to stop them :( but obviously not my heart !

Hi, I'm new here.
I am terrified of asteroids, comets, and anything else space can throw at us. Currently I have been in a slow-burn freakout for weeks, checking the news every hour, feeling like I'm about to die. I've had lifelong OCD but it's only in the past month that my obsessions have become this intense and this apocalyptic, and I am really struggling and don't know what to do.
I'm in a rural area so my options are very limited. I've seen a GP who agrees I need to see a psychologist pretty urgently, but she said there is absolutely no chance of getting in to see anybody - urgently or not - for at least 6-8 weeks. These invasive thoughts are constant, unrelenting, and extremely vivid; nothing can distract me from them, and I am in lockdown, so no option of taking a day trip or seeing friends to take my mind off it. 
I've been trying and trying and trying to find information online about what to do, but nothing seems applicable to my particular situation. Information on panic attacks all seems to assume that the main cause of distress is the panic attack symptoms; I don't care about my racing heart or shortness of breath, I care about what I'm scared is about to happen. Anxiety information is tailored to stuff like ""what if my house gets broken into?"" or ""what if I say something embarrassing in public?"", not obsessions on this terrifying level. Stuff online about dealing with intrusive thoughts gives me conflicting opinions - do I challenge the thought, or try to ignore it? Is it best to push it away, or it that repression that will make it come back stronger? Do I try to distract myself with mental exercises, or is that a compulsion? Breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation used to work, but they don't anymore. I exercise daily and eat well and don't drink. 
Any help or support would be much appreciated. I don't think I can take 6-8 weeks more of this with no help whatsoever.

First and foremost, I have anxiety. Most of the time I can cope, but recently something happened that has made my anxiety worse than usual. A couple of days ago, I was in the city, waiting for a bus when a man pushed me, twice. The second time was just as the bus arrived. I looked at him and started to ask what he was doing, when he informed me that he had a disability and was entitled to get on the bus first. I told him that he still needed to say excuse me and please and he wasn‚Äôt to push people. He then started yelling at me and saying words to the effect of how he didn‚Äôt have to and kept stressing at me that he had a disability. At that point, I saw red and told him he was a wanker.
Everyone on the bus and at the stop started glaring at me, at which point, I apologised to the driver for making a scene, and left.
Since then, my anxiety has flared up. I feel sick and scared that I‚Äôve done something wrong and that everyone thinks I‚Äôm a bad person and that I deserved to be pushed like that. I don‚Äôt want to leave my house in case something like this happens again and my imagination keeps creating scenes where someone filmed the incident and posted it online and people are saying this just proves what a horrible, selfish person I am. 
I don‚Äôt even know where all this fear is coming from‚Äîthe logical part of my mind knows I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, but my mind keeps coming back to it. I just want to forget and move on.

Hi guys. Just thought I'd ask anyone with experience with workplace bullying.
More importantly, I want to access if this could be a form of bullying or am I being too sensitive?
Company I work for, the owner is retired and his oldest son is the General Manager. Nice bloke. Very compromising.

The boss's youngest son has taken on himself to make improvements to the workplace and employees. (Micro Managing)
While we can do with personal growth, there are times where you can cross the line with employees by becoming heavy handed.
While I was discussing ideas about my work area, I found he talked down to me rather than being inspiring. Like everything I do is wrong and not in the interest of the company.

Part of the reason I wanted to talk to him was to grow and to work with other employees with positive steps.

I have various tasks and duties to do, which puts me in a position where I make decisions. The decisions are made to work (negotiate), with other people and to make me an effect part of the team.
However, after my discussions today with JNR boss, I feel as though every decision I make will be scrutinised in a negative way, that I'll eventually be afraid making a decision.

Instead of personal growth in the workplace, I feel like I'll go the other way.
I understand that If I make an error, then I have to take the criticism. (An ass-chewing from the boss)

All afternoon, all I could think about was using violence¬†or at least abuse him.
I feel as though he has taken away my personal peace and at night, my mind festers, which causes some level of anxiety and I lose sleep.

I was looking online to define Workplace Bullying and wondered if what I'm experiencing come under that banner of I'm just being sensitive.
In all other areas in life, I‚Äôm quite happy and positive. I believe a lot of peers will describe me as a friendly person

The thought of spending life at work makes me depressed to the point that I just want to stay in bed all day. I feel like there are so many things to be happy about in my life yet I'm so down all the time and although I love my job, I wish I felt happier.
I feel like everyone can see I'm having problems with my mental health, but very few people ask about it. I'm not the type of person to talk openly about emotions, but my face shows it plain as day. I feel like although I can do my job to a high calibre and I have a lot to offer, I don't feel as appreciated as I should. I put in all this work, even on the weekend and I feel like this.
I don't know what I should do and even though I've been taking time off work, I feel like I need more, but I've already taken so much off. More to this, a lot is due and they need me to help specifically.
 
I don't know what to do and I'm crying at random times of the day. Any advice is appreciated.

Hi my name is Mark and I've been suffering with anxiety for the last few months.

Basically I've been to hospital and has tests done. As well as seeing my GP regularly and have also done tests with them. Fortunately my results have all come back clear with nothing wrong.

There are days where I contemplate going back to hospital to have more tests done.

Being new to anxiety. I constantly question myself if something is seriously wrong with me. Even though I've had multiple tests done.

Ive had a couple of sleepless nights and a few panic attacks here and there. 

Some days are harder then others and I just have to pull through them.
Questioning myself how much longer I can go on feeling the way that I do. No I'm not suicidal, however just find it hard to live the way I'm currently feeling. 

Im off to see a psychologist at the end of the month to see if this will help me.

For me its not just mentally draining but mostly physically draining aswell, with all of my physical symptoms, my body constanly is in pain and aching. 

Please share any comments or tell me about your story. Any help is appreciated

I have been through a rollercoaster of emotions this last 7 months. From the traumatic birth of my first child late Jan to being in lockdown almost his entire life (Melbourne). As if being a first time mum isnt hard enough i have to do it on my own? Ive had no mothers group, no play groups, hes hardly even seen his grandparents. I havent been to a maternal child health nurse since he was 4 weeks old. Hes a terrible sleeper but i cant take him to sleep school or have a consultant come see us.
so essentially im a sleep deprived, social deprived, stimulant deprived mother wishing this nightmare would end.
We go for walks everyday, play in the house, facetime family, rinse and repeat...
i have a partner who is supportive but runs an events business so perpetually stressed due to the loss in business/ income so we are financially stretched to our limit as well.
i feel like im coping well but i have moments where i just snap. Im scared that im just pushing down the feelings to get us all through this and as soon as its over im going to crash and burn. Even though all i want is for it to be over.
any words of support or advice? Basically i want someone to tell me this will all be over soon and we can live our lives and see our family :(

Hi everyone first time posting anything here, and unsure about how it all works. Thought I would reach out and seek some help. So I will give you a little background;
My name is Chris and I have been experiencing all sorts of negative anxieties and even depression for the last ten years. I find it difficult to find the exact words to describe how i feel but this analogy seems to hit the nail on the head so to speak. 
Most days feel like I am in a burning building, the flames get hotter and I start coughing, wheezing and panicking, then i run to another part of the building and I can just about withstand it, but almost inevitably the flames rise again, trap me and the whole process happens again. The only thing that will extinguish the fire is rain, however it hasn't rained in years.
Bringing it back to the real world, panic attacks happen for me every now and again at least once every couple of weeks, it can be the smallest of things that trigger panic and some attacks are more severe than others. I have tried counsellors, psychologists and doctors and nothing seems to work for me yet, so I thought I would give this a go and reach out to people hoping that there are others out there who can empathise with my situation. 
Thanks in advance for listening

Hello,
As I was researching tips on how to deal with my GAD online, I often got the ""tell someone"" advice, but since there was no one, I though I could ask everyone how they manage to cope with anxiety when working on a group assignment.
Just a bit background on my situation: at the moment I'm doing post-grad. I've always been a high-performer in uni and taken the initiative to facilitate group work. I actually do not have any issues dealing with lazy members. So as a result, I've done pretty well for myself and this semester I managed to have myself included with one of the highest performing groups in the class. The people in the group are amazing and I basically can just step down from my usual relentless self who often shouts ""chop chop"" and gets people to work. However, because I've always been dealing with people who are performing at the same level as I do or lower, I immediately feel disorientated as I am no longer in control of the group since everyone's so high-performing and self-sufficient. I trust my group mates, respect their opinions and appreciate the work they do but that makes me feel like I'm the weakest link in the group. I always manage to muster up the confidence to voice my opinions, make suggestions but often afterwards, I feel stupid, I feel like I don't make sense and that other people can see through me. It get even worse when I get pushed back on my ideas - I feel like I could literally flinch every time people disagree with me. I really want to do well as a team member and contribute amazing work but I'm always afraid I'd let everyone down and that I'm not as good as they thought I'd be. 
To make it worse, everyone else in my group is a native English speakers and English is my second language. Usually I can communicate very well and don't have an accent, but during group meeting when my anxiety is high, I tend to make a lot of mistakes in my speech which send me into a vicious cycle of self-blaming and shaming.
I'm just wondering if anyone has experience the same thing and could give me some advice on how to cope with my anxiety better, because I really want to do well and exert more confidence when doing group work.

I just can't take criticism in any form. A while ago I was a victim to online trolls who took my name and tarnished it on a public Facebook group. I've never felt so low before. I was being blamed for something that had nothing to do with me which makes the snowflake feeling worse. I get so easily upset over the smallest things and I absolutely hate it. I don't know how to cope and it's really ruining my life because I just don't know how to build up a think skin to help me block out and ignore comments about me. Is there medication I can take that helps me stop feeling like everything said to/about me offends me? I'm open to anything that can help me right now. I've been to counselling quite a few times and that helped with other things but its never helped with how I feel. Please help me. 

P.S I'm really sorry if I upset anyone by using the term ""snowflake"". Its the only word I could think of to use to describe how I feel all the time. I hope you understand.

i have had (non diagnosed - too anxious to talk to someone lol ) for years and i dealt with my depression pretty well but i struggle with my anxiety. sometimes it‚Äôs not there sometimes it really is. i‚Äôve been manipulated and used and disregarded so much it‚Äôs ruined my ability to have a relationship, i always end up ruining it with my anxiety about being used or not being wanted. i have issues in all relationship in my life including family, friends and romantic partners. I either sabotage myself from something good or i just feel like the person is just lying to me or using me or they like me and get bored / sick of me or don‚Äôt want me anymore which makes me try to cling harder and i can‚Äôt stop it. relationships just become a sad thing to me. i‚Äôm seeing someone now and if i am not with him i feel like he doesn‚Äôt want to be around me or he‚Äôs happy i‚Äôm gone and i just have such intrusive thoughts including some minor suicide thoughts ( i‚Äôd never do it i just sort of imagine what people would think / if they‚Äôd care if i did ) i don‚Äôt know how to deal with this. i‚Äôve never had actual therapy but i‚Äôm very self aware and good at treating my own issues, i‚Äôm self educated in psychology and know the ins and outs of my own issues and emotions and where they stem from and why i have them but i still can‚Äôt get through them so i don‚Äôt think therapy will help me, i want to get anxiety meds but i am too nervous to talk to my doctor, anytime i‚Äôve tried i get embarrassed and downplay it or they suggest something useless and i just pretend like it would help. I don‚Äôt know how else to. my anxiety gets so bad sometimes i can‚Äôt leave my house or worst cases my bed. i just lie there like heart racing picturing being judged or anything. it‚Äôs weird because some days i‚Äôm so confident and fine, that‚Äôs why i think meds would help for those big moments and attacks. Is there any way to get medication prescribed online hopefully and hopefully a bulk billed session or something? i do have a refferal from one of my old doctors for beyond blue counseling but i don‚Äôt go to that doctors anymore and don‚Äôt want them to report back to that doctor. I‚Äôm at a loss because i want to be in a relationship and have friendships but they just make me so anxious that they become sad and i‚Äôm tired of being lonely.

Hey everyone,
I'm really struggling to communicate with my partner about my emotions and how I feel. Whenever he asks me how I am or if I'm okay I have this compulsive response of ""I'm fine"" even if I'm not feeling great. A lot of the time my mind starts to race with thoughts about what the ""right"" thing to say is or just trying to guess myself what exactly I'm feeling. My body just freezes up and I literally can't make words come out of my mouth. It feels like I'm paralysed and my mind goes into overdrive. He gets super frustrated with me and says that I'm not clear in what I say but I just don't know how to talk about feeling anxious or depressed or sad or angry and it just feels so dumb when I say it out loud. He's never judged me when I have talked about my feelings so I don't know why I can't talk to him. 
Does anyone have any advice on how I can get better at communicating how I feel?

Hi there, 
I have recently experienced strong feelings of anxiety when creating unreal scenarios when my partner is going out with his mates. I know I should not be other thinking this and I should completely trust him, although I know that this is more of a self issue and I‚Äôm projecting outwardly to my partner. I ended up ruining my partners night out and now we are trying to give each other space. Although this space is making me feel more anxious than ever, I‚Äôm constantly wanting to talk to him but he doesn‚Äôt quite understand that I may be experiencing anxiety. I‚Äôve tried to speak to him about it but he thinks that this is something that I need to fix myself. I feel like my outbursts of anxiety attacks have pushed him away and I don‚Äôt know if we will every go back to normal. 
has anyone experienced this or is able to assist me and guide me with what‚Äôs the best approach to this situation?

So I have a fear that I have cheated on my partner every time I drink and don‚Äôt remember something. I am in no way a heavy drinker. Maybe a few beers once a month or more on a Friday due to being locked down.
I drank the other night with my housemate while on a zoom video with some of our friends. We were having a great time and I remember majority of the night apart from the end. I woke up in the morning in bed with my partner in my underwear (I like to sleep freely). Automatically I panicked and though ‚Äúshit, what if I kissed our housemate?‚Äù. So I got up, checked our ensuite to see where my clothes were and they were there, I must of had a shower before bed. Even while writing this I‚Äôm automatically thinking ‚ÄúI must have slept with him and he put my clothes in my ensuite to cover it up and put underwear on me. Aaah!
Anyway I got up because I had to work from home and I was nervous to see him because I had convinced myself already that something happened. I don‚Äôt remember anything, don‚Äôt have any flash backs but I found myself looking in his room, sitting on the couch where we had the zoom and even kissing my hand to see if I remembered anything. I have been looking on the internet for the past two weeks trying to find answers there to put my mind at ease. I don‚Äôt think anything is weird between him and I, but it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm trying to find things out sneakily. For example he called me hun and I‚Äôm like why the heck did you call me that?
I know this probably stems from one occasion years ago when I got drunk and according to other people I cheated on my boyfriend and kissed someone and then they said they were tricking me? Who does that?
Or is this just anxiety? I‚Äôve always been an over thinker and think about my past and cringe and wonder what I could have done different. Like the time I was 10 and over thought so much that I thought I was a lesbian because my brother told me I was. Or when I put my dog to bed in the laundry and remember the tap was leaking and it might flood the laundry and he would get hypothermia.
I feel like I have something I‚Äôm hiding from my partner - why do I feel like this? Does it mean I did do something? Help!

After a year and a half of battling OCD (checking things constantly in fear of a catastrophe) general anxiety (just anxious and over worry) health anxiety (severe reactions to everything and convinced im dying) and nocturnal panic attacks, I need help.
I am a single home owner, I have no help, I am low income in a regional area. You cant see a doctor to get a referral without paying for it.  When you see the doctor and get the referral, you cant see a psychologist without paying for it.
We all know that sessions dont just fix you in one or two visits, it takes time.
I have no cash to to get the help i desperately need, have been to local MP's who dont want to help make changes in regional areas for those who have no financial support or family support.
I have tried online courses such as This way up and in the past seen several counsellors and psychiatrists.
Having nocturnal panic attacks night after night only feeds the anxiety and it is now affecting my work.
It is so frustrating when you want to get help, need to get help but you dont have the money to get help.
Life has become so frustrating and overwhelming with all the forms anxiety I have, I live in fear all the time.
Has anyone else been similar situation financially and any suggestions how to be able to get assistance when you are a single home owner on low income?

Hi I have always had anxiety and it has always come in different forms throughout my life but lately I feel like I‚Äôm suffocating everyday all day and I don‚Äôt know how to stop it!! I‚Äôve tried meditating, breathing exercises and more and whilst that stuff does work in the moment, I just go back to suffocating almost immediately after. I lead a very busy life so it‚Äôs majorly inconvenient for this to keep happening and there is only so much time I can put aside for breathing exercises/meditation each day before it becomes an issue üò≠ I have been prescribed medication by my doctor but I really do want to avoid using that daily, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a healthy habit to get into at all so really want to see if anyone else has ever had this problem and how they helped themselves long term?

Hi everyone 

I am feeling so defeated and anxious today I have been suffering with crippling anxiety for about 2 months now. After numerous ER visits and Dr visits I have been told my symptoms are caused from anxiety. 
I mainly get a feeling like I'm going to die all the time and leave my baby son behind. Whenever I get any weird body sensations I assume I'm dying and panic. It is so exhausting. I find it hard to believe anxiety can cause physical symptoms and not convinced I don't have a medical issue. I randomly get adrenaline rushes which lead to sweating , diarrhoea, uncontrollable shaking and weakness of my limbs. This scares me and leads me to believe i am sick. 
The past two weeks I have started meditation, colouring to ease my mind and had my first psychologist session on Friday. I have been good for 3 days  and I had a weird feeling Last night and had a panic attack  for no reason!!! I am feeling so upset I slept so terrible as I was scared. Every time I'm trying to sleep I feel like I can't breathe and gasp for air. I guess I was hoping I wouldn't have anymore once I tried to help myself so I feel like I have been set back. I am just so sick of feeling like this and don't know what to do. 
I don't really know where I'm going with this. Just needed to get it out

Hi everyone 
I've recently been diagnosed with anxiety and suffer with health anxiety. I have started seeing a psychologist and my GP has done lots of tests to rule out a medical condition based on various symptoms I've experienced.  I was feeling pretty good but the past week a couple times i have been relaxing in bed and suddenly my heart starts beating fast (120bpm) and is very strong and I can see it pounding in my chest. This really scares me. Afterwards I get the shakes.. can anyone tell me if this is a common anxiety symptom? Can it occur even if you aren't feeling anxious or thinking about anything in particular? This has caused my health anxiety to go into overdrive and I think I've got a heart problem. I'm going back to my GP in a couple weeks to discuss the heart symptoms but just looking for some reassurance in the meantime.. thanks

Hello everyone.
 I have been really struggling today,  and I thought writing here might help.
 What I am about to describe may sound weird, but it is a true feeling for me.  I wondered if anyone else reading has experience of it?
 Every now and then, I get this terrible sense of impending doom.  
Like, everything, everything, is about to go horribly wrong. 
 I have realised that I have been having these feelings semi-frequently for the last few years.  
A few years ago I experienced an intense trauma in my life, and I'm wondering now if there are triggers, like little,  tiny things, that possibly happened before the trauma, that I am not necessarily conscious of, that again happen now, in my life, and set me off on this spiral of doom.
 This morning, the feeling of impending doom had me thinking that the police were likely to turn up at my door and take me to prison.
 My life is good.  
I am safe. 
In my house. 
Consistently not committing crimes. 
And yet ... occasionally this feeling that the world is conspiring against me and everything good is about to implode just takes over.
 I understand that it's irrational, but there's something that sends me in a spiral, and anything simple can bring me back up that spiral as well, like a text from a friend, or something tiny like that. It brings me back to safety.
I just wanted to put this out there in case anyone else feels this way.  I want you to know that you're not alone, and I  thought I might feel some relief voicing this in a safe space. 
 I'm not really looking for advice or anything, just kind of wanted a place to talk about it, not just for me but for anyone who experiences this.
I feel so vulnerable.
 I mentioned something similar to my dad once and he said it's because I have a guilty conscience.

I live in the family home along with my 90-year-old mother.
I work full time and have been working for the same company for almost 30
years. I have no children or independents, my father died when I was 5 years
old. I am in my late 40‚Äôs and do not have a house or a mortgage to call my own.
Over the last couple of weeks, Mum has been to see a geriatrician doctor to see how Mums general health is. She will probably
need a pace maker cause of a weak heart, but she is in okay health although she
does forget things.
I have three sisters and they do worry about me, sometimes
they can come over too strong, like they are shouting at me or talk down to me.
During the week my sister rang me and told me the results of Mum‚Äôs test with
the geriatrician,
I was not upset with the result, though I did have a sleepless night thinking
about the future.
It was suggested that I should see the bank on how much money they
would lend me for a home deposit. I have almost no debt except $3000.00 owing
on hearing aids I had to buy a year ago. I have bought my own car. I have been
saving madly; I have a little over 11k in saving right now. I agree it is not a
lot but it is better than nothing. I have contacted Aussie Homes Loans and I have
contacted a financial advisor on the best course of action. I did not value money
as a young adult and now I am paying for it so to speak.
I have not heard from either Aussie home loans or the financial
advisor, so my anguish is sharply increasing.
Why does it hurt when my sisters talk to me in a serious tone of voice,
I feel as I have been emotional damaged in the past and I had a deep wounds
that have not healed. I know that I should‚Äôve had more money behind me by now,
but family shouted at me is going to stress me more than help and encourage me.  I wonder whether they would still care
for me once Mum has passed.
I had to share this; they say that a problem shared is a problem
halved. I guess I am looking for advice on how I should go forward. If I were
to tell me friends, this their attitude would be to take a spoonful of concrete
and harden up

Heyo. 
Don't really post on these things, but hope you're good whoever is reading this!
Over the past month, I've found that my anxiety, the voice in my head, and the worry about insignificant things are getting much worse. I've written a list of the things that I've been struggling with:

My boyfriend broke up with me suddenly earlier this week - just to top everything off...
I often find that my heart will race inside my chest as if I'm running a marathon, as soon as something small happens. 
Last week at work it got so bad to the point where I had to go to the change rooms as I was struggling to breathe. 
I worry about the smallest of things, down to the font on an email I send to my boss, and I often spend 15 minutes proofreading an email to either a colleague or someone I get along with. 
Last week, I sent a message to a friend asking for someone, and they didn't see it for 30 minutes. But I spent the next 30 minutes genuinely stressed out of my mind that I'd asked something too much of them. 
I spend so much time at home drafting my response to *if* something happens - which it almost never does. But I have this need to do this so that I'm ok if it does. For example, I'll worry that I'll get in trouble for something at work, and the night before I'll need to prepare how I'll argue/discuss this with my boss.
I always second-guess myself. All the time.
I get scared that I'm a burden on people and feel the need to get out of everyone's way both physically and practically, but in person I seem like a confident and out-going person. 
I am petrified of conflict and confrontation, even though it's my job to in a people-facing role. I've had times when I'm trying to have a serious discussion with a customer, an important person or the police and I can barely get the words out of my mouth or say the completely wrong thing. 
I often panic about things that happened in the past, yesterday, last week, last month or years ago. I worry that I made a wrong decision, and it's always on my mind. 

I know the first thing that probably comes to your mind whoever read this is that they're stressed over their job they should find a new job. But, I love the people I work with, and I often find that working avoids my anxiety at home or elsewhere. 
I think that my ""worrying nature"" and anxiety is more of a problem than my boyfriend breaking up with me, I know I can get over the latter but the first I am genuinely struggling with. 
Thanks for reading!

Hi everyone,
I'm new here and decided to join and make a thread about what I am experiencing atm. A week ago I had a panic attack (only a second one, my first one happened last year). I have no idea what brought it on, and since then I've been having constant anxiety attacks, with mainly physical symptoms such as trouble breathing, lots of yawning, unable to sleep, chest and back pain, tingling hands and feet, light-headedness. I've also been refraining from exercise as I'm already struggling to breathe. Also, been trying not to move much as my legs feel weak. I've been dealing with anxiety most of my life, I know that what I am experiencing is anxiety I just have no idea why in my head everything is fine. Yet I am experiencing the worst anxiety I've ever experienced. I guess I joined to ask if anyone else has had constant anxiety attacks after panic attacks? how long did they last? how do you deal with it when you have no idea what is causing them?
also, I have never seen anyone for my anxiety, has it helped? is it awkward? what happens in a session?
Thank you for taking the time to read

Hi Everyone, I have lived with anxiety for years now, recently I have weaned off medication and started CBT with a therapist. I‚Äôm feeling about 50% better however I have these weird nagging thoughts which are like a feeling that I should be anxious. For example something will happen that would have triggered me in the past, I won‚Äôt react and then 5-10 minutes later I reflect and start to feel strange and like I should be feeling negative feelings which then in turn makes me feel negative again. Is this normal? Does anyone else have experience with a similar thing? Any tips on how to cope with this would be great too. Thank you!

Hey guys, I just signed up for the site but I've seen you guys really help others out when they're in need. I'm a 16 year old male and I'm genuinely confused as to whether I have some form of anxiety at all, or if it is just teenager and hormonal moodiness and swings.
I just always seem to worry about the smallest thing with no reason to even think these things. For example, over these holidays and quarantine I am always worried that my friends don't like me anymore and I can't ask them at all because I believe that I'm going to bother them and I don't want to annoy them. When in actual fact, I'm always sure that they don't hate or dislike me once I look back at that thought and I feel stupid for thinking it. Stuff like this happens constantly and even ranges to me making up scenarios in my head about why they would hate me (along with other scenarios about random things that worry me). 
I've searched symptoms up for anxiety and when I look at them it feels like I match them but I also think that I may be reading into too much. Any help will be much appreciated, sorry if this post rambles on or seems silly in any way.
Thank you all so much in advance.

About a month ago I made the decision to leave my workplace due to being unable to find the energy to get up in the morning let alone go to work. I was in a workplace that wasn't suitable mine or bubs needs. 
It's been a few weeks and I am unable to get out of beds until 12pm and then just go straight to bed at 3-5pm for another nap. I know it's partly because I am pregnant and I'm growing a little human inside of me but I do have a diagnosed depression and anxiety and have been off my meds since I found out I was pregnant due to having risks taking them of deforming bub. So basically my routine is sleep, eat and sleep with very little fresh air as I struggle to be able to get myself out of the house also. 
My question to everyone is; does anyone have anything they tried to get them out of bed or out of the house? Are there any people that have been in the same boat as me and have found ways to improve their ways naturally? I don't want to go on meds again if I can help it and the Phsychologist can't do much as he can't just get me out of bed in the morning. 
I feel useless, I can't work and now I don't even know what I will do when bub arrives and he's old enough to go to kindy. I feel so lost...

Hi,
I‚Äôm 35 and last week, woke up with a sudden onset of floaters and over the next couple of days I had blurry vision. I then had a numb(ish) right leg. I went to the optometrist who said I had great eye health, astigmatism and gave me anti blue light glasses with a slight magnifying lens. I then had prickly kind of sensations and freaked out and went to the hospital. Over the course of a night, I had a CT scan (with dye), all my bloods done and a brain MRI.. everything came back ok and they found nothing abnormal on my MRI to suggest MS, but I‚Äôm still freaking out. I feel like my legs twitch etc and it sends me into a panic!!! I‚Äôm so severely anxious and stressed. I have been given a referral to see a neurologist and it can‚Äôt come soon enough, as I‚Äôm obsessing over looking up symptoms on-line and I truly feel as though I have it.. can anyone put my mind at ease? I know anxiety can do awful things to your body... can I really just go off a brain MRI?

To whoever is out there.

A little background. I'm of the larger/curvy variety of woman. I've been to gyms on/off since my early teens. I love working out & how I feel afterwards. My current issue is I've gradually put on most, if not all, the weight I previously lost. I have a gym membership but my anxiety stops me from going. 

What I mean by stops me from going is it gets to the point where I can't breath & panic sets in. I don't want another PT. It's not so much a waste of money but I don't want to spend it during the pandemic. I'm confident in my ability to organise appropriate exercises. 

This is my biggest issue at the moment. I'm absolutely terrified to go. I don't have anyone I can go with & I don't make friends easily. I know I need to lose the weight again as I'm feeling fat. I've managed to shut out some of my closest friends because of my depression & anxiety. It's the fear they'll see me & be shocked at how much weight I've put back on. 

This was a massive step for me. It's been an awful 18 months & I need to be able to get on top of things. 

Thank you for listening.

Hi, I'm an 18 year old female struggling with GAD for 7 years. I have no social life, no drivers licence, never had a job or boyfriend, pretty much in isolation at home 24/7, don't speak to my family except for my mum but she doesn't take it seriously nor understands. 

Does anyone else experience a great deal of anxiety about the time and future? I feel stuck in a constant loop of misery and dread. Thinking about living tomorrow, the day after that and so on makes me feel extremely anxious+fearful. I get scenario images in my mind about tomorrow having to go through the whole process again about being dreadful & miserable and repeating the same routine i did yesterday. I have had this for almost 2 months now no idea where it had come from. Just feel stuck in my head can't enjoy the present moment the future is all i think about.

Would like any advice or someone with similar experiences to help me with what I'm going through. I apologise if the explanation is a bit confusing. This is my first time doing something like this and I'm not that great at explaining but I hope you'll still be able to understand.

Hi guys, 

Lately, with my dad nearing retirement, I've been developing constant anxiety about whether I will be able to financially take care of my parents whilst dealing with my own mental health issues.

Both my parents were immigrants and came over to Australia with little to no money. We are not a rich family. Right now, my dad is 62 and works a really labour intensive job travelling to many different locations a day (around 25+); he is trying his hardest to work until he can reach 66-67 so that he can qualify for age pension benefits and won‚Äôt need to worry that much about finances. However, given that it is a really labour intensive job this is unlikely. At most, I believe my dad can only work for 1-2 years more. My mum has always been a stay at home mum of 3 and is currently a stay at home caretaker of my sister's infant (childcare is too expensive to be an option). I currently work as a casual employee but with COVID it is difficult to get shifts.

So, when my dad cannot physically work anymore and has to retire but doesn‚Äôt qualify for age pension benefits, it will be me and my older sister who will likely be taking care of the finances from then on. This thought has stressed me out and is one of the main thoughts that are triggering my mental health issues.

In terms of my health, I've been suffering from mental health issues for a while and it has affected me and my ability to do a lot of things. This year my mental health was debilitating; my mind would not stop overthinking about my finances and responsibilities. It was so bad I started having random panic attacks, even at home when there was no trigger.

I know Super is a thing, but at the current moment, my dad only has around $27,000 in his super. Arguably, this is not enough to keep afloat for a few years until he can qualify for his age pension benefits. I‚Äôve been really worried about what‚Äôs going to happen so I decided to halt my goals, deferred my studies (in law) to find a stable job and save as much as I can before this happens. ‚Ä®

However, my anxiety has made it difficult for me to commit to full-time jobs so, after deferring, I‚Äôve been searching for a part-time job at an environment that is calm and won‚Äôt have any events or situations that can trigger me. However, this is also difficult given the current employment situation in Australia.

Any advice or reassurances about our government benefits would be welcomed

I have always had anxiety. As a little kid I would have panic attacks if we drove across the Westgate Bridge certain it was going to break and we would plummet to our deaths. When their was a black out I was certain someone was going to break in and kills is etc. 
After having my children my anxiety ramped up. I am constantly certain I have one health disease or another and I become fixated on it and really depressed. Once I go and get it checked and get the all clear I am fine for a little while until I start to fixate on something else. I‚Äôm currently convinced I have breast cancer. I didn‚Äôt sleep. I now can‚Äôt eat and have to go to work soon and pretend everything is okay when really I just want to curl up into a ball abs cry. 
I finally got the courage to mention it to my doctor last year but be wasted me to see a psych. I also have social anxiety so speaking to a stranger opens a whole over can of worms for me. 
my biggest fear stems from leaving my children and not getting to see the grow up. So when I‚Äôm like this even seeing my children will upset me. 
 
I have a doctors apt this afternoon but my regular doctor was away so now I need to see a stranger üò¨. Plus I know she‚Äôll probably just want to send me for an ultrasound so that‚Äôs another day or so wait for that. I do already have dense breast tissue found the last time I was convinced I had breast cancer so my boobs already feel different so I can‚Äôt even calm myself down this time. I‚Äôm just so panicked today m.

Hi there, 

This is my very first post since I discovered this wonderful place. Reading the threads and other people's stories really inspired me. I feel like there is hope at the end of the tunnel and that I am not alone.

My story is quite typical, I am always sensitive towards other people's opinions of me since a young age. And it intensified since I started working. I also have very high expectation of myself, and these two combined have taken a toll on me from mid last year. I was put on multiple projects at the same time, in a territory I am not familiar with, I was working so hard trying make it work. However, with all the pressure and my eagerness to prove myself, it triggered my first anxiety attack. I removed myself from the projects to protect my mental health, but I felt quite shameful since then and ultimately found another job instead.

The new job was great to start with, however, there were a couple of recent changes have shifted the picture completely. Since the pandemic started, I have been struggling for a bit. The constant feeling of not being viewed as a good performer has haunted me on regular basis, I also feel quite difficult to nevigate through the office politics and play the game.

To change it, I've started to jog and meditate every day. I also write journals to record my feelings/achievements. And enrolled to a Mindspot online course. But the negative thoughts still hit me everyday.

Does anyone else experience it? How do you manage it?

So I have done some reading through the forums and I can‚Äôt seem to find one that mimics my symptoms although I understand everyone‚Äôs symptoms are a little different. I‚Äôm new to this and this is my first post. Hopefully someone finds this helpful!
my most common symptom is like a throbbing pain in my stomach and it can rotate up my ribs and into my chest, when I get these pains they don‚Äôt go away for hrs. So the throbbing pain is my most worrying one.
shooting/electric shock pain from left ribs down to stomach or in chest. 
Heart palpitations 
muscle spasms
dizzy spells
lethargic to name a few 
seen specialists, Had ECG, ultrasounds, CT‚Äôs, X-rays, full bloods and everything seems fine. Made big lifestyle changes but for some reason whenever I‚Äôm feeling down and anxious my mind seems to take control and put me in a  hole even after having all these test done. Anyone else get symptoms similar to mine? Just need someone to relate to so I don‚Äôt feel alone.

Hi everyone,
I am new to the forum and this is my first post.¬† I 40ish year old male who has always led a very healthy life and have always excelled in my professional life.
¬†However, my life has spiraled out of control over the past 2 years and my anxiety is so bad that I can't leave the house.¬† I had to quit work a year and a half ago so I could try to recover.¬† However, I haven't improved and if anything I have gotten much worse.¬†¬† My life started to change when I started to suffer from severe back pain which restricted my life.¬† On top of that, I have a chronic knee problem as well.¬† This hasn't been such a big deal but i know it was the start of my decline.¬† The restrictive nature of my injuries made me become somewhat reclusive.¬† During this period I had some financial stress and then had a family member become quite sick which again fueled my anxiety.¬† I was able to cope ok during this period of time, but became aware that I had some anxiety issues.¬† I know that I am predisposed to anxiety issues because it runs in the family and looking back on my life, there were times I was not aware, but i suffered from anxiety.
¬†Anyway, the above issues were not such a big deal for me as I handled it ok and function normally with bouts of what i thought was anxiety and depression.¬† The real trigger for my anxiety was when a contracted a skin disease on my face called rosacea, which is quite common (burning sensation and redness in the face).¬† There are many reasons for contracting this disease and one can be from high levels of stress and anxiety, which i am sure is the cause.¬† This condition made my anxiety go through the roof and I actually took time off from work to get my anxiety under control and to fight this condition.¬† I was still able to go out and do things but i did cut myself off from a lot of people especially some family members and friends, but i was doing my best.
¬†It was at this point of my life something happened which has totally ruined my life.¬† I went to a skin clinic for something else which was more for aesthetic reasaons around my eyes.¬† I informed the practioner at this clinic that i suffered from rosacea but didn't want it treated.¬† During two separate phone calls I had to tell the practioner I didn't want the treatment for my rosacea on my face which is done by IPL (similar to a laser).¬† I remember at the time being a little annoyed during my conversation because i twice told her i didn't want treatment for my rosacea.¬† Then i went for my appoinment for my eye treatement and I went into the consultation room.¬† The practitioner started to go on again about my treating my face with IPL for my rosacea.¬† Again, a little annoyed, i said ""NO"".¬† I told her the reasons, 1.¬† being that I am on beta blockers which have greatly reduced my burning sensation of my face 2. That my rosacea is very very mild and unoticeable to people 3.¬† That I have really struggled mentally and am at a point of acceptance.¬† 4.¬† I am really scared of IPL/lasers on my face.¬† The practitioner responded by laughing at me.¬† She then informed me that IPL was totally safe and that she has 17 years of experience and she treated her ex husband who had the same condition.¬† Again, i said no to her and then went into the treatment room for the treatment on my eyes.¬† Whilst laying on the table, she again kept at me about how she couldn't believe i was scared.¬† This is where i made the biggest mistake of my life.¬† I gave in and said, ""OK, do it but can you ""test patch me""?¬† I had read on websites about test patching for my condition.¬† She said, ok and test patched a spot and waited 5 minutes (later I was to find out that test patching of IPL should be a 4 week wait, not a 5 minute wait).

So as the title states ive gone through 8 month of sever health anxiety. It started last year with irregular heart beats then turned into breathing issues then now motor neuron disease. Im temoring , twitching and feel weakness in half my body. Ive seen just about every speciliast from a cardiologist ti a neurologist but all tests come up clean . At this point ive been under so mu h anxiety and stress speciallly with covid that im unable to work. I cant even talk without my face and tongue feeling strained. My neurologist thinks my brain has basically had enough and is shutting down . He said its time we start on something settle it down . He suggeted anti-anxiety medication for a month or 2 daily and then come see him again . He said once ive setelled down we will taper off and start a low dose ssri for the longer term . Now im reading horror stories about the daily use of anti-anxiety medication . I dont want to make my situatiom worse but at the same time im not functioning anymore . Im in a lose lose situation ! How hard will it be to get off medication after that period of time? Is it doable ?

Hi everyone,
I have a problem where i have recently changed jobs in the last 12 months- I have a technical background and part of my past experience has been that i was in a scenario where i had depression ( due to a work issue) and hence i was unable to display my knowledge in my field. After that, I got better and decided to go back to my previous role ( which wasn't very technical) and have done so- unfortunately rumours of my lack of knowledge have spread to my new workplace ( which is a company in a related field) and my fellow workmates are giving me trouble at work by menacing me, speaking ill of me and other subtle ways to show their anger.
Can someone advise me as to what I should do ? I have passed my probation and the job market right now is terrible - I don't really want to change my job, but dealing with this stress is killing me slowly.
 
thanks

Hi all,

I've been going through pretty bad anxiety over the last couple of weeks since stage 4 lockdowns started. In fact this year is the worst for me.

My periods have started becoming irregular since March, it has been late twice so far and this month it is late again and it is adding more anxiety/stress for me. My main worry of course is pregnancy even though the chances are quite low. I haven't taken a test yet because it hasn't been more than a week late but it is something I will consider if it gets any later.

I want to know, do any of you other ladies get delayed/missing periods due to anxiety? I haven't experienced this much anxiety in my life and my periods are always regular but the irregularity is stressing me out :(

Hi,
this is my first post here but I‚Äôve been visiting the forums since 2017 when I was first diagnosed with anxiety. I suffer from anxiety about my health mostly and for some stupid reason I continue to smoke because it relieves my anxiety temporarily but then it also adds to my anxiety about health. I know that I need to give up and I want to give up but for some stupid reason I keep finding excuses to to buy another pack. 
I thought I‚Äôd take this opportunity to introduce myself as I have made the decision to be more active in this group as I find reading other people‚Äôs posts help me understand that I‚Äôm not alone. I have days where I don‚Äôt want to talk at all and just need some time but my partner doesn‚Äôt seem to understand this and just thinks that I‚Äôm being distant for no reason. I have two young boys and feel guilty towards them for not taking my health and life choices more seriously. 
sorry for the rambling but I guess I just wanted to give a little snapshot into my background with anxiety. 
does anyone listen to any podcasts on anxiety? I drive a lot for work and I find listening to other people‚Äôs stories really helps me. 
thanks for reading üòä

Hi Everyone,
So I thought I'd reach out about this issue because I want to find a way to improve my situation and help out anyone else experiencing this :). 
Almost every time I hang out with my long time friends, I get so nervous that it interferes with having a good time. It has nothing to do with them but the fact that I can't completely relax around the people I should be comfortable upsets me every time. It upsets me, even more, when they are conversing so effortlessly whilst I struggle to talk back and can't hold my part up. Sometimes I worry that they'll leave me because I'm not interesting enough. I also don't want them to find out I'm struggling either whilst talking. The symptoms I feel are:
1. Persistent fear while a person is talking to me
2. Consequently, I can't concentrate on what they're saying when my mind is racing because I'm too busy trying to think of a decent/witty reply ahead or god knows what. Maybe I don't want to say something stupid.
3. I also feel like I'm losing my breath whilst I'm speaking a sentence.
4. I also seem out of touch with reality, like disconnected so I can't focus or be aware enough. This may sound so weird but it's the only way I can think of conveying what I feel like at the time: It's as if a ghost of me is speaking without my physical body. Or, if I was to lie on the floor, the top layer of me is doing all the work whilst my brain feels far behind me. This is what happens every time I try to speak.
Due to these factors, I often find myself agreeing or laughing because I struggle to engage in the conversation to bounce off each other's words. 
It may not sound too serious but it is absolutely controlling my entire being every time and I'm so sick of it. I just want to have a good time with my friends.
I just want anyone to confirm if this is some part of social anxiety and WHAT CAN I DO to get rid of these feelings???
Thank you so much.

Hello everyone. I really struggled yesterday with my anxiety to the point where I couldn't stop worrying and crying. I cried nearly all day. Today I am supposed to go into work but I really don't have the energy to go in. Is it bad to take a day off for that reason? Should I feel bad for taking the day off?

Hi everyone,
I'm a newbie here. male in my late 30's
in theory everything should be going well but I started a new career just before covid hit and now working from home with a new team and less support - my anxiety cranked up and I am having really bad panic attacks about work (whole body shakes, poor sleep, no appetite).
Feeling guilty because my 6yo is at home so I am trying to help with his home schooling but my anxiety is making me feel useless (and a burden to my wife - who has been amazing, but now I think it's starting to get to her).
I am starting to feel some negative thoughts about my self worth (and a whole impostor syndrome kicking in about being found out and losing the job, and all my self worth).
Sorry about the ramble, but it feels right to just say it. I am taking a mild antidepressant but I don't think it's working and I've booked to see a psychiatrist as well. Feeling quite scared about how quickly this is escalating.
If anyone has any tips on how to cope, I'd love to hear. Thanks for the support

Hi guys! So I am 3 days into the 14 day lockdown that I got put in (hotel quarentine, moved out of Victoria) and I have really bad anxiety about literally everything.
I have been living on my own for a long time, doing my own laundry, building my own furniture, cleaning and fixing my own house, getting my own groceries ect. and I love that because it means I don't burden anyone, noone judges me and I feel so much more comfortable.
But if you don't know, with the 14 day quarentine, you cannot leave the room. So people have to take your rubbish, other people do your laundry, you have to call reception to ask for help with things, and I absolutely hate it. I don't like having to rely on other people and burdoning other people, and I feel quite uncomfortable ""forcing"" someone else to do my laundry.
I also have to place an order with Woolworths to get some stuff delivered to my room that I absolutely need (toothbrush, bathroom items that aren't provided, some snacks for between meals, ect.). However again, it needs to be delivered to reception and then they bring it up to me. 
I have so much anxiety about people judging what I buy from the shops, what I get delievered, what I'm wearing (when they are doing my laundry) that I'm almost not doing any of it. 
I know it's their job and all that, and using logic they probably really don't care what I get delivered or how much rubbish I have or how many times I call reception to ask questions, but anxiety doesn't use logic and I am anxious and really don't want to do anything that is going to burdon them. My woolworths order has been sitting on the checkout page for like an hour but I just can't bring myself to order it because I am so anxious of what the workers will think of me. 
But I also can't leave my room and do everything myself.

Hi guys!
You may have seen me around a little bit, so I will just give a brief synopsis with an update. I am in a toxic abusive house and I have to be moved out by end of next week due to housemates cutting lease in the middle of a pandemic. I am moving back to my home state with family who refuse to acknowledge my (diagnosed) mental disorders and have been abusive in the past.
Now onto the update.
I have bad swelling in one of my feet and I went to see a doctor today. She said I have (likely) blood clotting around my foot which is obviously very dangerous. 
So now within the next week I have to move all the things out of my room and into the removalist area, get someone to help me put unsold furniture on the curb for hard rubbish collection, pack my car up and get that taken to the removalist, book flights, quit my job, somehow get rid of all the rubbish in my room (tips are closed now for general public and my housemates keep filling the bin before I can put anything in there just to be difficult), go get a scan on my foot and a follow up with a doctor, all the while wearing a mask and following COVID protocols that are literally changing every day.
I'm not sleeping well, I'm not eating well, my anxiety is through the roof every second of every day and I don't know how I am supposed to get all of this done alone. I also don't have much money (my job was a casual minimum hour shift once a week) and, with my foot, struggle to walk without being in pain. I don't know how I am going to do this and am terrified and scared of this fast arriving deadline that seems to be getting more and more anxiety inducing every day. I am trying my best to take things one day at a time but I'm really struggling with even that concept. Now with the added anxiety of possible blood clots in my foot which is very dangerous, I feel overwhelmed by anxiety and don't want to do absolutely anything at all, which is in turn making my anxiety worse because the day keeps getting closer with not much more happening.

Hi! This is my first post here but I really need some advice so please tell me if I do anything wrong or if this post is only me being dramatic.
I'm a Year 9 student with anxiety/OCD/depression and since beginning high school, I've been sitting with the same friend group. I was only close friends with one of them (and my other close friend sits with a non-English speaking group) but the rest didn't mind me being there so I was fine with that. Last term though, half of the group moved schools and now the few of us that are left have all moved to other groups. I'm not comfortable enough with any of the others so I just followed my close friend to a group that she knew from her classes I'm not in. I sat with them for two days before my close friend basically told me that I was being too quiet and weird, and that I should go make other friends. My classmates are always friendly and I've tried asking some of them if I can sit with their groups, except they've all said they don't really want new people to join them. I've been crying in class sometimes whenever I remember and I have a constant empty ache in my chest/stomach which stops me from calming down and relaxing even at home. I hate how bad I feel all the time and the way that I can't do anything I used to like doing after school without being worried about tomorrow. Recently I've just been going to the library at recess and lunch then eating my food during class but it's closed one day each week. When the library is closed I try sitting with the group I followed my close friend to originally but I can tell they don't want me there. At this point, I think I might just hide in the toilet and read a book instead on that day. The truth is, I kind of enjoy being alone, I'm just worried that the other students or teachers will judge me for being some pathetic loser. I'm really hoping to study abroad next year if the borders open back up, which desperately want them to do because then I'll be gone for all of 2021 and will only have to survive Year 11 and 12 here (at least then I can pretend to be constantly studying for my HSC). My parents are very kind and supportive, but I don't want to tell them because I'm ashamed that their only child is like this. I'm really sorry for all my rambling, but does anyone know how can I find a friend group or just feel better about this entire situation?

I just wanted to see if anyone out there could help me with some advice. 
I personally have generalised anxiety. For the most part I have it under control but as we all know bad days come and go. 
My husband has anxiety also. He has had this longer than I have known him and struggled with it on and off. He had a period of 6-7 years when we first met where for the most part it was under control and his medication was working for him. 
Now he keeps having these moments every 6-12 months where he gets terrified of going to work. The first time this happened he wouldn't go to work for 6 weeks. That was extremely hard. Since then its happened 2-3 more times but not for as long. It has ranged from a few days to a week. We are currently going through it again. He is nearly on week 3 of not going to work. He has eaten through the small bit of leave he did have. 
He has been in this job for over 10 years and if his boss didn't experience anxiety himself I honestly believe he would have lost his job a long time ago. 
I dont currently work. This was a decision that we made together and we are getting to that point in life where it's time to start thinking about a family but now this is happening again I dont know what to do. 
As harsh/bad as it sounds I'm losing trust in him. He will get up, get dressed and leave to go to work but then an hour later I get a text telling me he couldn't do it and he's turned around and gone to his parents house. Which is beyond frustrating. He defiantly over involves them in our lives. 

I'm at a loss and I dont know how to deal with it anymore. I know he can't control this but he is setting off all my fears and anxieties and affecting my mental health. 

If anyone could give any advice I would greatly appreciate it. I just dont know how to handle this anymore when it keeps happening over and over again.

Hi everyone, I would really appreciate it if anyone who's experienced anxiety could take the time to read this and send through some advice.
One of my closest friends has alluded to her struggles with anxiety, however she has a really hard time opening up about her feelings. On the odd occasion that she has made comments about her challenges, I think I've handled the situation poorly as I've rushed to giving advice/diagnosis (I now know NOT to do this) rather than properly listening. 
She lacks adequate support from her family as they have a hard time understanding mental illnesses, and so she's extremely reluctant to open up and seek help (perhaps due to a fear of judgment?) 
I've never had major issues with anxiety and I don't always know how to act around my friends that do have it, and so I really need advice from people who have been in my friend's situation. Here's some specific questions I have, even if you just answer one or two it would be a tremendous help. 
I know I can't push her into confiding in someone, but what can I do to let her know that I'm always there to talk to?
If she does open up to me what are some things I should and shouldn't do?
What were the things you really needed to hear from your friends when you were experiencing mental health issues?
Should I suggest some resources for her, or does she need to be the one to take action?

I recently relocated towns due to being really unhappy in my previous work as well as being unable to make meaningful connections in my outside life. I have been in my new place for just over a month and I am really enjoying my new work however, I can't help but still feel empty inside. 
My anxiety levels still seem to be really high and I feel like I cannot make proper relationships with other people (no motivation to go out on a date/lack of desire to try and meet someone). I know that relationships aren't everything, however as I get older I can't help but feel I am going to be left behind. For so long my anxiety has ruled my life. It tells me I am horrible and ugly, it tells me I am unworthy and that people will judge me. I don't feel beautiful or that anyone will want to get to know the real me once they find out that I deal with this on a daily basis. 
I have friends that seem to care about me some of the time, but I frequently question how long they will be in my life. From previous experience people tend to leave me without warning or explanation so it's hard not to feel like I am the issue! 
I have tried joining a sport to find people but this has been unsuccessful in the past. As for online dating, I have been on a few dates with people but this never leads anywhere and I am at the point of just not even caring to go on the apps anymore as it feels like it will never be worth it. 
Have other people been able to shake this feeling? Or get past it? Or are some people just not destined to find their person? 
I am in the process of changing my anxiety medication to see if it will help but with that also comes its own anxiety attached to it too.
Would like to hear people's thoughts and to know I am not crazy for thinking all of this?
Thanks :)

Hi
Im 25 years old and have been dealing with severe anxiety and panic attacks since young.
Ive been on a number of different medications. My conditions go through phases: sometimes manageable, sometimes not. When it‚Äôs good, I can cope with going grocery shopping and a few outings per week. This is always followed by an episode which can happen at any time.
I‚Äôm currently seeing a third psychologist to better manage my situation.
I am worried that this may be a lifelong condition and that I won‚Äôt be able to get and maintain a normal job. I cannot cope with full time work at this time and I‚Äôm not sure I ever will.
I am just hoping for anyone else‚Äôs experience in navigating Centrelink for similar situations. I don‚Äôt want to rely on it - far from it. I would love to be ‚Äònormal‚Äô and this is always my goal.

Hello, I‚Äôm new here but I have an old problem. I‚Äôve had severe health anxiety for a number of years. I know what causes it - a build up of stress and internalising problems. It started after my dad passed away 10 years ago following untreatable cancer. It comes in waves - I can be fine for years and then something triggers me - work stress, reading something in the news etc. I am very creative and boy I can scare myself. It‚Äôs horrible being like this in front of my husband and children. I feel guilty and ashamed.
This is the worst I‚Äôve been though and again is due to a lot of stress - my younger brother has pancreatic cancer and I‚Äôm very close to him. He‚Äôs doing well so far and is due to have a huge operation. I‚Äôm his main support so feel a big pressure to be up and happy around him too. I also lost my job a month ago so there‚Äôs been a lot of time for obsessing and googling. 
I have risk factors for breast cancer and have a mammogram and infrasound today. I am a mess. Beyond a mess really. I‚Äôm taking my husband with me but want to know if anyone else has gotten through anything similar. If it‚Äôs a bad result, I think I will totally collapse

To all the anxiety survivours,
1. You're stronger than you think. It isn't easy battling demons in your head. In fact, it's exhausting! For 25 years of my life I've been at war with myself. Sometimes I let the demons show, other times I don't. It takes strength to hide something so severe and fool others into believing you're fine. Trust me!
2. Anxiety isn't your personality. It's all in your head, not something that characterises you. You're a beautiful and complex human being. Don't ever feel you aren't, just cause somedays feel harder than others.
3. Anxiety is serious and can have an effect on your whole life. Don't ever let others tell you to 'toughen up' or make you feel that your problems are insignificant. These people are the problem, not you.

Hi everyone... I don't post a lot here. I'm more of a reader but I was wondering if anyone had any tips for the situation I'm going to mention below.

So I suffer from anxiety and depression for over 10 years. It gets worse with every death in the family. Late last year my grandpa who I was really close with and was a second father to me got really really sick and passed away early this year. Now I live with my grandma as my dad and uncle have passed 10 years and 4 years ago respectively.

I have been with my current partner for over a year and a half. We've decided to not have kids. I believe I wouldn't cope mentally. I already have enough issue trying to sleep and manage myself. My grandma ever since my grandpa got really sick pushed me to have a baby even though I told her I don't want one. I talked to my partner about not having one. My partner already has two children from previous relationship and recently got the snip. That's fine.

My concern is the amount of stress I feel when my grandma brings it up because it leaves me a quiet closed off mess and I find it hard to talk about it with others. My grandma has, for lack of a better phrase, my life ""planned out"" as in get married and have kids. I am very lucky to already have a house I'll be paying off. It's hard when I don't want that. It's hard because my job as a teacher lets me teach and build relationships with other peoples children and that's enough for me. My gran doesn't get it but I love her anyway as she's the only blood family I've got living with me during this coronavirus stuff and my partner who is a few towns away from me in regional Victoria.

I don't want to have a child just to make my grandma happy... I don't know what to do as she doesn't approve of me not wanting kids because of my legitimate mental health concerns.

Sometimes I have good days sometimes bad. With my anxiety and depression it is sometimes 2 steps forward 5 back. I try to do things to keep it at bay, eat right, try to exercise, get sleep, medication, meditation etc...But it is always lingering...knocking at the door or window ready  to overwhelm me at any moment. I should look at the positives...I am employed, I have a family that loves me. All that makes you feel guilty of feeling like this. Getting tired of treading on water. The tsunami of emotions make it hard to stay afloat.

I have a mild Disability 
",Anxiety

I have been aware for several years that I have a crippling anxiety around medical tests, to the point where I basically don't have them done.

So I was born with a genetic condition inherited from my father. The syndrome has various symptoms, all of which are present at birth.

His major symptom was huge trouble with his eyes from childhood , resulting in him being legally blind at around 59 yrs old.

I did not have eye trouble to his extent at all. I am now 51

When I was 19, in 1988 I accompanied him to an eye specialist. Even though I did not have an appointment they put me in the chair. They saw some vascularization on my eyes and said basically quit your life you will be blind in 10 yrs.

I have been to numerous eye doctors since then who have said your corneas are fine, you are no tf going tyo go blind. Probably 5 different eye doctors have said that.

Well I took that 30 yr old report to an eye specialist 2 weeks ago because of some dry eye symptoms and he said your eyes have not changed , and in fact my visual acuity test was 6/5 (excellent)

But the last 3 week's waiting for this appointment has been a nightmare. I can't forget that original diagnosis and I feel like maybe all these other doctors were wrong and the first diagnosis was right? I have no issues with my vision and I know it's illogical but the trauma of that diagnosis of blindness, even though I didnt believe it at the time has haunted me. I can't get rid of it

I have an appointment on Monday with a dry eye specialist and waiting for this appt has caused me such¬†severe¬†anxiety¬†to panic attack mode. I've been going through this this for 3 weeks since I booked it

I never ever EVER book medical appts. Dental ones are fine, but anything else no way. I wil never forgive that eye specialist 32 yrs ago for what he has done to me¬†

Hi,
I am struggling with anxious thoughts. I have been in a relationship for nearly 7 months. At the start it was so good I was constantly having fun. 
Recently though we have fought a lot more. I‚Äôm not too sure why, we have spoken about communication and how we need to talk about how we feel to avoid this. 
He knows how he feels, he knows that he loves me but I‚Äôm just not too sure. My mind keeps telling me to break up with him because maybe that would be easier for us both and better for him. Whenever we talk about breaking up I just cry because part of me doesn‚Äôt want him to leave but then I don‚Äôt know why I think I want to break up with him.
I have extremely low iron which I was told could be a cause. But I also do have bad anxiety. My boyfriend tells me that the thoughts I have of wanting to break up and not knowing what I want is normal and that he will always be here and that it‚Äôs his choice. I don‚Äôt want to hurt this boy because he has always been my number 1 supporter along with my parents. He is constantly there and all he wants for me to be is happy.
I just want to know I‚Äôm not alone in feeling this and that it is normal for my anxiety to doubt and second guess everything.

What is someone called when they‚Äôre distant towards you but also make snide remarks/comments in the disguise as a joke. Or how about when they‚Äôre distant from you and your son but you‚Äôre not sure what‚Äôs actually their problem and now you get this horrible anxiety so crippling you literally skip town in hopes you don‚Äôt see them so you don‚Äôt have a big confrontational argument because you‚Äôre scared of what will happen because you‚Äôve tried that in the past and it back fired on you & were made to feel like your feelings were invalid, that they are allowed to judge my music taste, like they are better than me, like the person who made you feel like they had a worse childhood than you due to sexual abuse but didn‚Äôt know you actually suffered sexual abuse from a family friend and to this day still haven‚Äôt told anyone apart from mentioning it right now. 
Now her (my eldest sister) daughters (my nieces) are distant towards me, don‚Äôt acknowledge my son most times & are apparently different to him when I‚Äôm not around. Her eldest daughter will not acknowledge me in town anymore. That‚Äôs okay, her and I never really became close after the first blow out. Her youngest was quite close to me up until Easter and now all she thinks is my son is spoiled and she‚Äôs not (whole other backstory; she got more Easter presents then my son and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm going to say). She won‚Äôt even acknowledge my son (2yr old) if he‚Äôs trying to get her attention, he‚Äôs very persistent and he‚Äôs not speaking much but he can definitely use his voice to indicate what he wants. He could practically be on her and she wouldn‚Äôt even look at him. Yet with her eldest sisters sons both 4&2 she is all over them and interacts with them but with my son she is cold. It‚Äôs starting to affect me to the point I don‚Äôt acknowledge any of them & the fact that my father and another niece from my other sister is telling me things I‚Äôm not comfortable with (not acknowledging my son, idc about me). My foot was put down when my eldest sister invited my mum out for her birthday dinner, that‚Äôs fine, she usually asks if I want to go but things had been pretty rocky so I didn‚Äôt expect it but felt a little hurt. Then they come back to pick all my nieces up to go back to her house to cut mums cake. They got my eldest niece and her two boys over there but they never texted me or rang me, not even to include my son. Which was very odd considering they would usually contact me. I felt so hurt I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone for days.

Towards the middle of this year I began to find my anxiety being a bit of a problem more so than usual. Just thought id send a message out to others on here to say I hope that the year can get progressively better with whatever mental/physical health problems you have experienced. I don't know if I believe in prayers or wishes but sometimes they are nice to say anyway.

Hi I‚Äôm a new member, I work in a pharmacy and am finding the social distancing difficult as our store is a bad design to allow for this. There is no concierge to limit the number of customers even though we have a limit of 20 this causes congestion at the scripts out counter which is a high traffic area where the staff have to pass through to access the staff room, toilet, consult room and where the prescriptions ready are stored. We are in stage 3 restrictions so the limit is allowed but staff aren‚Äôt feeling as though we are being cared for as we are all in such close contact. We all have families to go home to and I love my job and want to keep working but feel my employer isn‚Äôt looking after us.

I don't know if it's just me but sometimes when I am out in public and think I am feeling ok I do strange things that drive my husband crazy. I will be walking along fine one minute taking the lead and then just suddenly slow down and expect him to take the lead ( often without me saying anything). It's like I have suddenly become too afraid to lead or say i don't know where i am going. I don't know why I do t speak up or have a 'real' reason for the change of tack. I will do the same thing boldly walking first into a new cafe/bar/restaurant but then sort of go off into some other planet lost in thought and don't communicate anything to my husband or dither about with the cafe worker. Is this normal? It's like I just lose focus on what I am doing.

Hi im new here,male in my late 30s married with 2 kids mortgage etc etc and have had a lifetime of on and off worry and anxiety from as long as i can remember. I know deep down I'm overreacting to most situations and i tend to overthink and  run thru these in my head before and after events. I tend not to live in the moment thru life and look back at certain times and wished i could of relaxed more and enjoyed myself at the time. I think back and really enjoy those memories more than actually living it at the time. 
I was a shy quiet kid at school. Especially at high school where i went most days with anxiety of what may or may not happen. I have a social anxiety too which has eased over the years as ive gotten older but still comes out from time to time. 
Lately i have been in a bit of a rut with my worries getting me down. My wife has a chronic illness which she is in alot of pain constantly and can't work. So ive been the only one bringing the income in and i feel so much pressure to be the only one doing so. I feel burdened by this, sometimes i feel trapped. One of my kids has a learning disability and her struggles get me down and i worry about her future too. There are times i struggle to Sleep with my worries always on mind which add to the anxiety and periods of depression. 
Thanks for reading my post

I have a significant personal history of mental illness including anxiety disorders and OCD diagnosed during my childhood/teens (and a major episode about 18 months ago), and also a family history which includes schizophrenia. As a result, a lot of my anxiety at the moment is me worrying that certain behaviours or situations will make my mental health issues get worse again, or even precipitate a psychotic break. 
One of the things I have convinced myself will ""cause"" me to develop schizophrenia is lack of social contact. What happened is that late last year, I read an article saying that if you are in a risk group for schizophrenia, it is important to have social contact as it can reduce the risk of having a psychotic episode, and also that social withdrawal is a sign that you might be about to have one.
As a result, when I decided to move from a sharehouse into a studio flat after getting a full-time job, I developed some anxious thoughts that this (living alone/wanting own place) was either an indication that I was about to have a psychotic episode, or could actually cause one. Now with the lockdowns, I obviously have very little social life, and am worried that I could go crazy. 
At night I feel scared, or don't like it to be quiet, or get scared of shadows, or have broken sleep with bad dreams (usually related to coronavirus, e.g. being sick and taken to hospital but the ""hospital"" is actually a conference centre, etc). But then I worry that not sleeping enough, having weird dreams, feeling scared at night, or doing something odd (e.g. mindlessly brushing my teeth when I walk into the bathroom) are not normal for an adult and am signs that I am ""losing my mind"", or, more concretely, am about to have a psychotic episode.
Is this normal, is there any way to stop it, and does it indicate that the stress might be causing me to have a psychotic episode?

Hi all, 
I‚Äôm new here, and apologies in advance for the mess this post may be. 
I have struggled with anxiety for a long time now. I started dating this guy 6 months ago who I am head over heels in love with. But he doesn‚Äôt understand anxiety at all and really struggles with my anxiety. I‚Äôve tried numerous ways of talking with him about it, but nothing clicks. He gets stressed and frustrated. He‚Äôs got a very dismissive/avoidant attachment style when it comes to discussing serious things whereas I am very much an anxious attachment person. In every other aspect of our relationship, we are PERFECT. honestly, he is amazing and we work so well together. 
We got in our first massive fight last week, where our relationship almost ended (over the dumbest thing that was exaggerated by my own anxiety) and now he has gone on a trip to the snow with the guys this week. My anxiety is at an all time high. We worked throughout relationship before he left and we are ‚Äúgood‚Äù. However, at the back of my mind, there is a voice telling me he is going to cheat on me because he is still mad at me. He has given me NO reason to feel this way, and I know logically that it is my anxiety talking, but I can‚Äôt stop this pit in my stomach. I don‚Äôt want to be needy, or put this anxiety on him because he honestly deserves a fun week with his friends right now. I was cheated on in my last long term relationship when we were living together, so I know that trauma has something to do with this  
I guess my question is, how can I help ease this? And is it possible to to cope with my anxiety when my partner simply cannot understand it and has a very different communication / attachment style to me? 
im so scared of ruining the first relationship I feel so great about and can see a REAL future with. Please help.

I'm not one to talk about mental health. I find it difficult to speak to others about it and will often bottle things up.

Hi this is my first time doing anything like this. so.
So my fear was and still is having depression. I know its really stupid but I can't help it. It all started when my cousin told my mum I had depression, luckily my mum isn't stupid and she asked me if I did. I said no. But now I've been thinking about it more and more, my anxiety doesn't help, and I have recently been searching how to know if you have depression and its scaring me because I don't have the strength or courage to ask my mum for help. I don't understand why I'm so worried, I used to been in control of my anxiety but now this topic is starting to bring it back.
I don't understand and I'm seeking help.

Hi all
I'm new to this forum and just reaching out to see if anyone out there has or is experiencing muscle twitching all over, strange muscle fatigue and soreness particularly in calves and forearms that cannot be explained, tingling/pins and needles in hands and feet...as though there's not enough circulation  there.. occasional sharp shooting pains in muscles or possibly nerves. I have had a very stressful past 12 months so I'm hoping these odd new symptoms are anxiety related. I have definitely had the worst health anxiety ever this past year... could these new symptoms be my body's way of telling me I'm in fight or flight? Two doctors do not seem to be concerned. I'm worried about MND or MS or something else and am I am booked to see a neurologist next Monday.
I'm trying hard to stay positive but I cannot believe anxiety/stress could cause such blatant physical symptoms. Feeling scared and alone.
Hope to hear from someone!

It‚Äôs been a tough few months, I have been working on my complex trauma & depression & have noticed small improvements.
But I feel like my anxiety is getting worse. So my past 2 sessions with the psychologist have been focused on that. My psychiatrist also prescribed a new anti-anxiety med but I‚Äôm yet to notice any effect as yet (it‚Äôs only been 6 days use so far).
Anyway, I am truly mystified by my behaviour with the psychologist. I was telling her about the time I was at a party & was too scared to ask for a spoon. It‚Äôs sounds incredibly ridiculous, but that‚Äôs what happened. I decided not to eat my slice of cake because I was too scared to ask for a spoon!
So the psychologist said let‚Äôs practise now. I had to pretend to hold the cake & ask for a spoon. There was no one around except her & I. And I felt so embarrassed & humiliated I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it. And I burst into tears.  A week later I‚Äôm still mystified why I found this so difficult????
Today my anxiety was elevated after just talking to the psychologist about my breathing. She wanted me to do the breathing exercises we had practised last week. But I would not do it until she looked away. I just couldn‚Äôt stand to be watched while I ‚Äúbreathed‚Äù. So she had to turn away from me while I did it & she talked me through it.
What the h*ll is wrong with me???? Then she asked me to say one thing nice about myself. I couldn‚Äôt. I told her this & she kept pushing me. I finally come out with ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm caring‚Äù. She said ok, let‚Äôs work with that. And she made me repeat after her numerous times ‚ÄúI am a caring person & that is why people like me‚Äù. Over & over. She was waiting for me to say it in an affirmative manner. When I finally did she praised me & said to give myself a pat on the back. But I couldn‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt feeling any achievement, didn‚Äôt feel like a deserved a pat on the back. She mentioned that I have some very negative core beliefs (we‚Äôve been through all that previously) but as it turns out, It seems I can‚Äôt accept praise from others or even praise myself without feeling awkward, embarrassed, humiliated.
i don‚Äôt understand why feel this way? Why is anxiety so hard to live with & understand? 
why do I do the things I do? 
does anyone else find their daily lives messed up because of anxiety or missed opportunities because your anxiety? Or am I the only sad soul out there who doesn‚Äôt fit into this world? üò¢

Hi everyone, this is my first time doing this and I‚Äôm terrified but here goes.
one night I got spiked with MDMA by people I knew, I have had history with anxiety, it didn‚Äôt affect me that bad but I felt a lot of anger with the people who did it, fast forwards 2 months I went out with the same people, they were talking about taking MDMA and a few minutes later I was convinced I got spiked again, I had someone I could trust with me and they took me out of the situation and tried to convince me I wasn‚Äôt spiked but I wasn‚Äôt having it, it felt so real and was convinced something was wrong.. after that night my anxiety has been so bad, where do I begin.. firstly I am convinced that I am developing schizophrenia because after that night I have been so paranoid.. I always have panic attacks that I have been spiked again, I can‚Äôt drink from bottles, I don‚Äôt trust anyone and always think they have alternative  motives, during this time of my life my then girlfriend had left me and literally attacked me, I couldn‚Äôt believe who she had become which made me even more paranoid, I can‚Äôt go out on a date without some type or paranoid thinking, it‚Äôs causing me panic attack after panic attack.. I have so much on my mind so I apologise if I‚Äôm not making complete sense, to go back to what I was saying about the night I thought I got spiked, I was conviced I actually got spiked for a while but realised when I had a similar panic attack that I didn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm still very paranoid about everyone and question everyone‚Äôs motives, I‚Äôm scared that these are the first signs of schizophrenia and I‚Äôm developing it, I‚Äôm terrified can someone please help, thank you.

Haven‚Äôt been on here in awhile. This has been the hardest year I‚Äôve ever had - EVER. I‚Äôve been looking for a new rental for the past 8 weeks solid. Put it this way, if I were to get paid for the effort I‚Äôve put in id have about $3000 of extra money in my pocket. 
I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I‚Äôve got to get out of this place. Can‚Äôt stand living with dad. Not only does he not support me or is unable to, he actually annoys me and further fuels my anxiety/ocd/panic. My anxiety is affecting my OAB and is creating very real symptoms. 
The rental market has gone completely mental and there must be up to 12-20 applicants per house. I have looked at 500 homes online, 60 - 70 in person and applied for up to 14 homes. My record is immaculate but it‚Äôs a numbers game and people don‚Äôt like pets. 
while I‚Äôm anxious I‚Äôm also quite frustrated that someone won‚Äôt give me a go. I‚Äôm starting to really dislike people and I‚Äôm just pissed off I can‚Äôt get out of this place no matter how hard I try. I just need a break. Mums trapped in QLD n I‚Äôm trapped here in WA. I‚Äôm trying to organise a house for mum n I. The covid19 was the worst thing to happen to this economy and people‚Äôs attitude and perception in general. 
I need a house the most but I‚Äôm getting the least acknowledgment. I gotta be honest I can maybe go on like this for another month. I‚Äôm seeing my psychologist and he‚Äôs good but yep I give it a month before I completely lose the plot. To be honest I‚Äôm soo tired at looking for homes it‚Äôs ridiculous. I suffer with ocd so doing something over and over is something I actively try and avoid to be normal. Looking for rentals for 8 weeks solid makes me feel very distraught to say the least. 
anyway...

Hey Guys,
I've have been struggling with debilitating anxiety for a while and had a few bouts of depression as well. I've posted on here before and the support has been great. I was hoping to ask for some more advice as it's been almost a year since then. I have been to see my GP a few times and I've seen a psychologist once (Until COVID happened and I haven't been able to go back). Currently, they have opened back up and before I talked myself out of it again, I book another appt for late August. My anxiety has gotten to a point where it's affecting my everyday life and ability to live (for a while now if I'm honest) and I feel as though I stuck in a sort of limbo in wanting to move forward, but not being able to on my own. Recently, I've had to open up to my parents which has been difficult but necessary. My mum has been trying to occupy my time, get me moving rather than dwelling and trying to provide some purpose, which has been good. But I feel like I've just gone as far as I can with just that, and I'm still not able to move forward in my life. I'm on a leave of absence from uni as it was getting to be too much for me. the deadline is running out on this and I don't know if it would be the right decision to return or not or even to try a new path. It was taking a significant toll on my mental health and I was becoming incredibly frustrated and disappointed in myself - I struggled to concentrate, focus and retain information. Also, myself self-discipline and motivation were almost nonexistent - only the pressure of deadlines was enough to get me to get any work done. 
So, my question is what can a Psychologist really (and practically) do for you? I really just wish and need to get myself back to a point where even if I am still struggling with my anxiety and can manage most aspects of day-to-day adult life.
Also, if any of you guys with similar issues may have some advice on how to cope and manage to work or study (especially from home) any advice would be appreciated. It is incredibly difficult and disheartening to struggle with every small thing and to work and study so hard only to come out the other side feeling as though you remember nothing.
Thank you all in advance.

Hi,

I hope everyone is well, I'm in rural victoria so heading into lock down again.

I've been working from home since march, in the office on and off. I always thought it would be great to work from home but turns out if I'm alone to much my anxiety sneaks up on me.

I have a bad habit of ruminating and distractions are what stops me. If I'm alone there is nothing stopping me.

The idea of being locked down from seeing my parents and even my inlaws is terrifying.

I'm lucky, I'm allowed to work from my parents house, due to my anxiety. But it does make me.wonder, how happy can I ever be if I cant be alone?

I have a fear that has troubled me all of my life. It is a fear of sudden loud noises. In particular, balloons popping and fireworks.


For some reason, the sounds cause a reaction in my body and it gives me a really bad feeling. It can make me jump and in often a reflex action I will put my hands to my ears.


It means that if I go somewhere like a childrens‚Äô party, I am very on edge about balloons popping. I will often hide away or disappear because I am so troubled with my fear.


I have often avoided social situations if I knew there were balloons or fireworks. I would often hide away in toilets or other areas to avoid.


I used to be really bad when I was young. I was scared of thunder storms. Even the small popping sound a Christmas cracker would make scared me. I am ok with this sound now, but when I was young, I would block my ears when the family was pulling the crackers. One year at Christmas, my parents were extremely nasty. I was putting my fingers over my ears as the crackers were being pulled because I hated the noise. It was like a loud bang to me. My parents were wanting me to not put my fingers over my ears and telling me not to do it. I got very scared and had to go in the other room. I was frightened of both the sound and my parents being angry at me. The next thing I remember is my mum and dad both coming towards me and hitting me at the same time. It was like I was being gang beaten. Then followed big arguments between my grandparents and my parents over the treatment of me. Then I was accused of ruining Christmas. Then my mum wasn‚Äôt talking to me.


I am ok with Christmas crackers and thunder now, but back then I was really frightened.


Can anyone relate to this?

I've been with my boyfriend for 8 years and he is my best friend, I can't imagine a future with anyone but him. We have had some difficulties in our relationship in the last few years and while I feel that we are past that now, my anxiety is causing me to question our relationship, doubt how he feels about me and worry that we aren't going to last. 

Logically I know that these thoughts are my anxiety speaking and not my true thoughts, as I don't think this way when I'm not feeling anxious. However, I'm worried about the effect this could have on my relationship, as my boyfriend is quite sensitive emotionally and he can take on my negative feelings when I'm anxious and feel sad himself. This makes me feel like a burden to him and worry that one day he will feel that it's too hard to deal with me and my issues and leave me. I've talked to him about these fears and he assures me that this will not happen but I'm so scared. I also worry that friends and family I've spoken to about this just think that our relationship is the cause of these feelings and that I should leave, but I absolutely do not want to do that. 

 I've started speaking to a counsellor and really hope I can learn how to manage my anxiety, as I don't want it to ruin my relationship. I want my relationship to go back to being my safe, happy place where I don't overthink and misinterpret every little thing as a sign that my boyfriend is going to leave me. I want to trust in the love we have for each other and ignore those horrible thoughts in my head.

I suffer from health anxiety and was extremely anxious when all of the COVID-19 cases were occurring in March. Unfortunately, I live in Melbourne and I guess you can see where this is going now.. Like many others, I went into lockdown with a sense of hope that we could beat the virus and the vast majority were on board. When things were looking better my anxiety began to ease and I was functioning kind of normally. Now with the recent jump in cases, the anxiety is back but with a new twist. I am really, really angry and starting to take it out on others. Like many Melbournians I am furious there has been a complete and blatant disregard for others' health by it seems a not insignificant part of the community. I generally avoid conflict which can also be a problem, but lately if I see someone do something stupid I get really angry and actively have a go at them. I know the anger stems from the anxiety and the fact that I want to feel safe again. However, I don't see others are on board and I'm acting out. I'm getting also frustrated at what I see as dithering by the Authorities here. Anyway, enough of the personal view i'm struggling and becoming angry not sure what to do with the anger

Hi all,

I
want to start out by saying i'm 31 and never had any prior history of anxiety
or health issues, I have been fortunate to have been healthy for the past 31
years. I'm usually a calm person and don't let things annoy or stress me but
this all changed 3 months ago when I was sitting in work and suddenly got heart
palpitations, I wasnt doing anything stressful when suddenly my heart was
beating so fast.I went to the emergency room, they did some tests and drew
blood, again everything was normal. Over the next few weeks I had a long list
of symptoms that appeared to be constant and never really went away, ranging
from dizziness, headaches, numb left foot, ringing in ears, internal shaking,
muscle twitches, pins and needles etc. I eventually got a full ultrasound of my
heart done and no issues found. Since then most of my physical symptoms evolved
around my feet and hands, numb left or right foot that would come and go,
tingling in my legs and feet, random muscle pains in my arms, shoulder, back
etc, headaches and a general sense of just not being well. I went to the doctor
and 2 different neurologists, I have had possibly every blood test there is and
they all came back negative. I had a Brain MRI and a spine MRI, again they came
back negative. I have nerve tests, both large and small nerve tests and again
all negative.over the past number of weeks my main problem is still my feet, I
just dont feel right when im walking, something is off and its never the same
thing, sometimes its my left foot and sometimes its my right, paired with weird
sensations in my hands and off an on burning and cold toes (they feel slippy or
something)I have read alot of these forums about how people have anxiety
attacks which create symptoms and its a constant cycle. But unless I am
misunderstanding, these symptoms fade when the anxiety fades. For me though, I
dont' feel anxious at all and yet the symptoms have been constant ever since
that day I had palpitations 3 months ago, Now I will admit I am always thinking
about the symptoms and what they could be as they are a constant annoyance but
even recently over the past number of weeks I have accepted that none of these
symptoms add up, they change so much and vary, with the main theme being my
feet and yet none of this will go away. Is it possible this is really just anxiety or should I go back to
the doctor? I have nothing else in my life that annoying me or stressing me, I
feel unwell.
Thanks

i think the last time i posted here was in 2016 when i was going through a very tough time, i posted something brash in a fit of helplessness, since then ive managed to survive but now days i feel my old dreadful self coming back. 

Long story short ive had depression and anxiety what feels like my whole life , and possiblly even bi polar for as long as i can remember , it honestly feels like i was born with it. 

Ive been unemployed for over a year and i really think my current situation with my job network is making things worse, they are constantly changing case workers and then i have to explain my entire life story again, they really dont understand how anyone with these illnesses feel, nor do they care, they are so desperate to place me in a workplace that my current case worker has told me to lie about my medical conditions, and i quote her "" would you hire someone who admitted they have asthma and admitted they are not fit enough to climb up ladders all day"", after i told the interviewer for a roof insulation business that i was not the fit fast individual they were seeking as i had respiratory issues and i am simply not fit enough to do it efficiently , even though i said i was happy to give it a go anyway, i told them i could do other tasks if they wanted, i would make them lunch and drive the car around, bring in supplies, whatever they wanted, but the interviewer said its probably not worth the time to try and he was also actually very happy that i was honest with him about it.

A day after the interview my case worker called me back in a fit of rage, her condescending tone is driving me mad, and as i said above she is wanting me to lie just to get a job, either im crazy, or she is a psychopath.

i feel like all these job networks hire people with the skill set required being ""proficient in Microsoft word"", and the workers use the job network to fulfill there fetish of talking down to people who come in.

Anyway, im thinking about booking an appointment with my GP to finally bring up my feelings, im hoping there is some thing he can do, or give me that i can give to centerlink and get me to switch to a provider who can deal with people like me, but my anxiety about it is so bad that i dont know how to ask the doctor about it..i want to write it down and give it to him, i dont know if thats appropriate. i would rather die than speak to my current case worker again, but if i miss even 1 phone call of hers she will stop my pay.

Hi everyone, this is my first post and first time reaching out to anyone. I'm working a job where occasionally the clientele trigger some of my past traumas and anxiety in relation to my previous relationship where I experienced domestic violence and emotional and verbal abuse for around 10 or so years. Recently, I have been able to compartmentalize and cope with this area of the job when it arises.
My issue currently is constant worry and anxiety related to co-workers behaviours. The working environment amongst staff has become fairly toxic the last several months and I'm struggling more every day to tolerate it. Every part of me wants to walk away from this job and throw in the towel. The affect its having on my mental health is affecting me as a person, as a parent, and as a partner. My fiance is loving and supportive and has not once complained, always been there for me to vent and cry with. But I'm becoming sick of myself. I'm sick of feeling like a half arsed parent and partner because this job is draining every part of my soul. I have to hang in there a while longer for several reasons. I'm wondering if anyone has any tips to help tolerate an impossible workplace full of petty drama.

You know what really ticks me off with this anxiety crap... doctors automatically assuming that my anxiety is causing my abdominal pains. It‚Äôs one of the first questions they ask. Sometimes there is a physical issue, sometimes not. This is what causes my anxiety and depression to flare up. 
I recently had a trip to hospital feeling extremely unwell with abdominal pains. While they didn‚Äôt do ultrasounds all other tests came back clear. Before this trip I had an infection and was treated and have ultrasounds booked for August. 
I just cannot stand anxiety and I wish it would just go away.

Hey everyone, I need some help.
I know I have depression and anxiety but I want to go get a professional diagnosis. I‚Äôm also couch surfing and drug dependant.  
Will a normal GP be able to do the diagnosis? I also will need a letter from the doctor for Centrelink aswell to help me as I cannot work or do activities. This is a struggle and I do not know the right way to go about it and whom to go see.
Thanks, please anyone who has been through this give me some details on how to get the help I need....

Hi there everyone - I‚Äôm so happy to be a part of this forum. Currently feeling very alone, knowing there are others that are experiencing the same, makes me feel supported. 

I have never been one to feeling like I had a form of health anxiety until recently - 8 months after having my daughter. Now having so much to live for, I am feeling an immense pressure and pre occupation that I am going to become terminally ill. 

I had my first panic attack over the weekend - a hot flush up the back of my neck, numbing in the right hand side of my face, tingling in my legs (which may be nerve related) and a feeling of derealisation. Of course, I had this checked - CT and pathology came back normal but have an MRI scheduled tomorrow as well. I have since had tingling in my arms and like others have mentioned, this also feeds the fear that there is something terminally wrong with me. It‚Äôs a very stressful time. 

Are there any new parents experiencing the same sort of thing?

Hi everyone I'm new here :), I just thought I'd create this thread to chat with people who have had similar experiences so we can help eachother through!
I'm a 19-year-old female who has been living with anxiety for as long as I can remember. It was quite obvious from around the age of 8 years old I had anxiety and as I got older it advanced and developed into the physical symptoms, which was absolutely terrifying for an 11-year-old as every day I thought I was going to die. It came in severely destructive stages which was almost immobilising for me and it stopped me from doing things I had always loved and transformed me from being a usually very cheerful and positive person into someone extremely fragile and different. As I got older the physical symptoms always popped up again in stages and I saw a psychologist after it got extremely bad one time but I didn't think it was working extremely well for me and I eventually grew out of the phase as time went on. What also really affected me is that no one took it seriously or understood why a kid who had a good life was behaving this way because no one expected me to have anxiety. However I was lucky because even though my parents didn't completely understand they tried to get support for me and help me! But for a child who had no idea what was happening to my body, panic attacks at that age was one of my scariest experiences to date! Although I wouldn't change having it from a young age as it taught me so much and allowed me to help others as I got older.
However, as I became older and was aware that it was anxiety after being diagnosed, came an excessive amount of anger and frustration when another phase started because I knew nothing was wrong but it was out of my control, which I think a lot of people have misinterpretations about this element of anxiety because you can not simply ""calm down"" or just ""get over it."" 
 
It still always comes in phases, especially if it concerns health as I definitely suffer from health anxiety or hypochondriasis which often rules my life and still refrains me from doing some things which I want to go and seek some type of support from!
So if anyone has had similar experiences or just wants to chat please feel free to do so! Or if anyone has any recommendations that would also be greatly appreciated! Thank you and I hope everyone is well! :)

Hi,
In November last year randomly I started to feel a numb feeling on the left side of my face that could be alleviated only when I touched it with my hand or something external.  
It didn't bother me at first but after a week I went to a GP who suggested it could be viral but then after another few weeks sent me for a MRI of my brain to be sure nothing else was going on. 
On Christmas eve the results came back with the all clear but they incidentally found a small aneurysm in my brain that didn't explain the symptoms. It was a bit of a shock and naturally I thought the worst,  I wasn't able to see a neurologist until March so spent 3 months worrying about dying because of it and stopped all exercise and anything I thought could increase the chance of rupture because I was given no guidance by my GP other than not to worry about it. 
The neurologist said that it was small and in an area that would unlikely rupture and only require monitoring and that I could live a normal life without worry. Of course this was great news but my facial symptoms continued.
The day after the appointment I started to feel dizzy, not in a room spinning way but in an off balanced elevator type of way. No treatment from physio or anything has helped since then so I have had this feeling for almost 5 months on top of my face and now a stomach issue (possible gastritis)  that has been put down to anxiety. I have started to see a psychologist who believes I have health anxiety. 
Now I don't even worry about the aneurysm but having all these other symptoms constantly does lower my mood and make me worry about my health. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms? 
Nothing I'm doing seems to help them stop. I'm not sure if anxiety symptoms can present months after the initial stress but these overall have been going on for almost a year now and before them I was a very happy and healthy person with great mental health. 
Just wanted to see who else suffers from these symptoms especially as long as I have. 
Thanks for reading

So today I went to my best friend's Dad's birthday party that I was invited to a couple of weeks back. I told my best mate that I was hyped for it and keen to drink a lot and have a good time, but really I was super nervous for it, I could hardly sleep, my heart was racing the entire walk to his house, and I was dreading it if I'm honest. My mindset was as long as I drink enough my anxiety will go away and I'll have a good time, it's worked for all the parties I've gone to before this so why wouldn't it this time?

Anyways, I get to his house, all is well and good, and I go to mix my first drink. I was mixing it on top of this big keg that his Dad had restored not too long before and didn't want to get dirty, but all of a sudden his dog jumps up onto the keg with her front paws and knocks the drink over. Great, now I'm at least partially responsible for getting coke all over this keg that his Dad doesn't want to get dirty, and on his birthday no less. I know it wasn't my fault that his dog jumped up and knocked it over, but I still feel really guilty. I hate being the centre of attention and my drink getting knocked over made me exactly that (at least in my mind). To top it off, my friend then had to spend 10-15 minutes just wiping the keg off and soaking up all the drink. I felt so bad but couldn't even muster up an ""I'm sorry"" or ""No let me clean it up"" because my anxiety is that bad.

Anyways, after that, I couldn't get that out of my mind. I kept replaying it over and over thinking that my friend was mad at me or something because of the drink, even though he probably wasn't and knew it was an accident. I ended up 'going to the toilet' several times to just sit on it on it mindlessly doing stuff on my phone, because anything was better than having to socialize. I suck at it so bad and am always so awkward it drives me nuts. 

I made it a grand total of 2 hours before I made up an excuse of ""I'm going to buy more drinks to mix with"" when in reality I was just going home. I feel like utter trash lying to my best friend but I just can't take it. I needed to find a way out of there. I'm writing this not even 5 minutes after getting home because I just need to get it off my chest. On the walk home I was on the verge of tears and when I finally got home I couldn't hold them back. I hate it so much.

At this point I'm not sure what to do. I want to message my friend and be honest with him and tell him why I left, but I don't want him to think badly of me.

Hi. This is a post a long time in the making... to summarise I've been on a downward rollercoaster for over 16 years (29, male). I'm still not sure what's pushed me to go ahead, but if I was to guess, I would say it's the heightened focus on mental health-particularly, the ""Listen Days"" on Triple M-that's led me to finally say my piece.
The guts of my problem is that I'm about as social as Stephen Hawking was an Olympian; while I've had social groups over the years, it's always gone south-in most times through my own fault than others. This is intertwined with my extreme level of negative thinking. At any time of day, my mind can be bombarded with negative memories, as early as embarrassing myself in my 4th grade school concert to as recent as the most minuscule factor my most recent social interaction. While I have a loving family, they are very... 'old school', and my struggles with my sexuality as well as a construed thinking that I can never make my parents ""proud of me"" prevent me from ever making a proper connection with them in the (foreseeable) future. As for love, I lost the one woman I ever loved due to my own paranoia, and I feel the one man I've loved will simply never understand my predicament. Lastly, while I firmly believe I am good at my work, my social ineptitude has led to me being in dire employment straits in the near future.
Please understand, I've 'tried'; I've done the psychology, I've done the CPT, I've tried prescription medicine. I'm ashamed to say I have 'given up' for at least the last 18 months; I am stuck in a purgatory of procrastination... and, ashamedly, other medication (the only thing that has allowed me to sleep at night for the past five years without the preceding hours being filled with dark thoughts).
I am not sure what I am looking for in this post; part of me is just looking for someone who I can relate to privately without judgement, part of me is looking for some miraculous solution for it all, part of me thinks while the public has paid more attention to mental health recently (thanks to a global pandemic and prominent Australians succumbing to mental health in the past few years, properly starting with Danny Frawley and most recently Shane Tuck) ALL the ""aids"" suggest the first step is to talk to a FRIEND. Well, I have no friends I can talk to, so here I am. What now?

3 years ago my ex left me because 'he didnt love me anymore'. I later found out that he had cheated on me with his workmates and used me to save money to buy the house that was supposed to be for us. It was a 5 year relationship that I put everything I had into as I had never loved someone like that before.
Since then my life had never been the same. He broke me and I am so ashamed I ever let myself be in that situation. I havent been able to open up to anyone because I dont feel I cant trust them. I'm 33 and feel like I have missed out on my life, kids and the possibility of ever loving someone again. 
I feel like every man who talks to me is just going to lie to me, and I dont approach anyone because I feel like they're going to get bored of me and use me.
Its so hard watching all of my friends and family get married and have kids, and then there's me still alone and nothing to show in life.
I dont know what to do and its breaking me more. I feel like I've lost a part of myself and I dont know how to get her back.
How do I get past these feelings of never being good enough? How do I trust anyone again? How do I trust their intentions for me?
The only time I feel strong is when I'm at work,  outside of work I go back inside my shell and just pass time until I go back to work.
I really dont know what to do anymore and I'm tired of crying.

I'm 27 and haven't been employed since I was 17. The period between 2011 and 2016 was a complete waste, I was depressed and too anxious to do anything with my life so I just stayed home. Then at the start of 2017 when I was finally going to get everything together my mum died and that knocked me back, then the start of this year was meant to be the year I get it all together, start uni (bachelor of IT), make friends there and all that. Covid hit and my uni was put online but a mixture of anxiety about studying and anxiety over now having it online made me end up skipping term 1. Term 2 starts soon but the anxiety and panic attacks are back again and I don't think I'm mentally capable of studying, so this will be yet another wasted year. I'm 27. Unemployed for almost a decade, basically unemployable at this point. Never got my driver's licence due to not being able to handle the stress of that and now it's even harder. I've missed out on so much in my life because of my anxiety, I've never even had a girlfriend of any kind. I'm stuck living with my grandparents since I can't afford to move out and get on with my life or even at least provide for them. I'm thinking of studying a certificate III in health services assistance in the hopes of being a hospital orderly or something like that now, I'm hoping I could at least be capable of doing something like that. Depending on how studying that goes I might try a diploma or even bachelor degree in nursing. I just know things would be so much easier if I had my mum here to talk to, she was like a friend to me and helped make things clearer for me.
I know I need to get help for both my anxiety and depression but I'm just too scared to turn to anyone for help and I don't know what to do. I'm sorry if I put this in the wrong spot, I'm not really in a good spot at the moment and I need to vent.

I can‚Äôt stop vomiting, I feel like fainting, can‚Äôt get off the bathroom floor, I hyperventilate and no matter what I try it just doesn‚Äôt stop.

I believe this has been covered before. But as I am currently very anxious and stressed I just want to try and connect with people who may have experienced this themselves.
Ever since a friend of mine told me they were unwell and have had some blood tests, I have felt intense stress and anxiety that something may be wrong with them. They still haven't received the results. 
Since they told me they were going to the doctor, I have been experiencing the following:

Muscle pain and spasms (moves around my body)
Joint pain (moves around my body)
racing heart
tingling feelings in hands and toes.

I find it gets worse as they day goes on.
I remember feeling similar symptoms when I was waiting on blood results last year. I don't remember it being as bad as this (or maybe I just don't remember).
Is this relatable at all to anyone else out there?

I chose a role in which requires me to have regular meetings and client contact. Unfortunately, due to my social anxiety, I feel routinely overwhelmed and unsuited for the role. I chose the role thinking I could grow and learn, but 2 years now I constantly take days off. I don't feel suitable to the work and I regularly feel guilty for skipping work. I feel stuck because of the current covid situation. I also lack confidence because my social anxiety has hampered my work in the past. It just so happened my current role directly involves speaking that makes me overwhelmed.

I think the best decision would be to suck it up due to the current situation, but I generally feel like I have lost interest, motivation, and confidence. I am regularly speaking with counsellors and I have a therapist. I feel better for a time, but I go back to giving uo and wanting to leave the job.

I guess I am just looking for any advice.

This is my first post so I‚Äôm a little bit nervous but here goes. 
I‚Äôve been in a relationship with my parter for 1.5 years now and she is everything I could ask for- kind, caring, understanding, loving, seriously the most amazing And perfect person I have ever met. 
About 6 months ago I had a few small doubts about our relationship resulting from us going on a short break. We are back together now and everything is perfect except I can‚Äôt stop overthinking those doubts- why they came up? If I should just ignore them? Am I just overthinking? I keep worrying that at key moments (eg propsoal, wedding, moving in together) I‚Äôm going to have doubts. I hate myself for feeling this way and having these doubts because I‚Äôm really in love with her. I have talked to her about all of this and she has been so understanding and said that it‚Äôs ok and we can just take it slow. 
I guess all I‚Äôm wondering is how do I work through this? How do I take control of my anxiety and be fully present in my relationship- I love her and I will do anything to sort this out- breaking up is not something I want to do.

Hello everyone, 
New to forums really wanted to join beyond blue they helped me get my mother out of suicide.
 Just a quick overview ;I'v lived with GAD and mild ADHD inattentive for most of my life but have managed a good chunk with various methods but have hit somewhat of a road block in my life and afraid for the next coming months ahead and am seeking some advice. 
The rundown ;I'm 33 weeks pregnant expecting my firstborn, recently moved to Victoria from Brisbane a few months back before border closures.I've had bouts of antinatel depression and have been incredibly Ill for half my pregnancy including hospitalization. Luckily I've had a great support network whilst living in Brisbane and managed to get through these episodes.But now being an unfortunate new Victorian my support links and resources are now either inaccessible or very restricted causing me to become anxious about possible relapsing into antinatel depression.I have no friends down here in Victoria and my own family cannot support me for health reasons,my in-laws and some friends where planning to come down and help after I give birth but borders now shut Vic-Qld.Some facilities are also not operating or are restricted because of covid 19.I am also at the stage where I can't pyshically do alot.The midwives at my local hospital have been great and suggested I reach out for support if I feel like my mental health is wavering and I understand some support groups are restricted or simply very busy with the current events.
My questions ;What to do to keep yourself less anxious as a new mother to be with next to no support living down here in Victoria?Constructive things to keep oneself distracted during this time not including the internet and TV? (All I have right now is cooking and book reading and light walking )And Support networks accessible in the East Gippsland region for people such as myself? as I'm very unfamiliar with this region and so I have no friends down here the neighbours are quite nice but everyone is very weary about being out during covid 19.
Any tips and advice would be great no matter how small,thankyou for reading

Hi, looking for some help with this
I've had like 10 sessions with my therapist and I guess it's not going great. I know it's probably mainly my fault but I still don't know if I should try a different therapist or not.
I guess the main reason I was going to a therapist was like social anxiety. But going to see her has been up there with the worst social anxiety I've ever experienced, worse than the anxiety that made me go see someone. I feel like the few days after I see her my socialising is much worse than usual because I've put myself in that mode from being anxious when I see her, so pretty much I feel like it's been worse since seeing her.
She just makes me very very nervous and I always feel she is judging me and I guess that's my fault but I just can't face going back to see her again, it makes me so anxious just thinking about it. I don't know if I should try someone else though because I can't imagine having to go through finding someone and meeting someone again, and what if they don't seem to be so nice either? I think I might just not find another therapist and not see this one either.
Any help? thanks :)

Hello. I‚Äôm a teenage girl, and I‚Äôd say generally I‚Äôve lived a good life. Nothing really triggering has ever happened to me.
but I have extremely intrusive thoughts (i think?). I am somebody who is very, very easily scared. I mean, if you make a sudden noise I would shriek and then think about it for hours and have a suuuper fast heartbeat. But these past few months i keep imagining horrifying things.
I keep picturing my main phobias and I can‚Äôt stop all these thoughts and its driving me crazy :( I would be eating and suddenly feel the urge to vomit because for some reason I can‚Äôt stop picturing scary images in my head.
i am so scared of the dark because of this too. I have a tendency to run really fast if an area is dark and try to find a lightswitch, but i get too nervous to touch it thinking some kind of horrible monster is going to be on it. The same with entering literally any room, even if its not dark, just when I am alone. Sometimes i start crying and get a huge wave of chills because of all my overthinking. I also start to have hiccups after thinking of something scary.
The more i try to make it stop, the worse it gets. And since i‚Äôm always so busy focusing on trying to get rid of my thoughts i keep getting angry and annoyed at everybody? I dont even know why, i dont want to get mad! :( I‚Äôm not an angry person at all.
Sometimes i start to cry too much and actually vomit because i think too much. Also, under some pressuring situations i get super nervous and cry+vomit. This sort of thing happened to me 4-6 times last year during class, on the day we had some sort of assessment or speech or something. It was so terrible, i can‚Äôt believe i cried so much and vomited all over my desk :(
i always imagine the worst. And if there is any problems i always worry about them instead of fixing them. And i can‚Äôt even move my body to do things, i feel so lazy and am too worried i will mess everything up. I keep thinking maybe i am just being childish. My sister has one of the same phobias as me and cries when she sees stuff to do with it, but one time  i saw it for a second i cried for ages and kept shaking. I kept picturing it everywhere, too.
I want these thoughts to go away. Even when i try to sleep them off i have really scary lucid nightmares. I can‚Äôt even cry about it anymore because I am so tired of it, i just sit down sadly in a corner and wish for it to stop. Even writing this made me feel very uncomfortable. What do you think?

I struggle with bad social anxiety which is the cause of the lack of relationships in my life, and this has lead to me being depressed over a long period of time. Both have been hitting me especially hard these days with no support system to fall back on. I am away from my family while studying in Australia and making friends has been just as hard as it was back in my home country. More so with Covid present. I don't know how to cope. I speak to the school guidance counsellor occasionally but there's only so much advice they can give me.
 
What has worked for you if you too have experienced this?

Hi everyone! Sorry I‚Äôm new to this.
I have anxiety and it has always increased during relationships but usually it corresponds with the realisation that the relationship isn‚Äôt going to work.
Ive been dating this wonderful guy for just under a year but as a result of COVID, he lost his job and slipped into a depression. 

His low mood seriously affects my own mental health and I find myself just getting anxious. When I‚Äôm with him and he‚Äôs okay then everything‚Äôs perfect. But when he‚Äôs low nothing will help and he can be really grumpy and rude. 
I finally told him he needed to get help because it was affecting me and he promised he would. But it almost feels too late. I‚Äôm checked out and feeling resentful every time he has a low patch because I know how it will affect me which feels really selfish given he‚Äôs so understanding of my anxiety. 
I‚Äôm not sleeping properly and get intrusive thoughts of various scenarios ending the relationship and get no work done because I‚Äôm constantly trying to problem solve. 
How do I support him whilst making sure I‚Äôm supporting myself? I‚Äôm seeing a psychologist but still feel really anxious. I can‚Äôt deal with the unpredictability.  I‚Äôm worried that after pushing and pushing him to get help, I‚Äôve already checked out and haven‚Äôt given him the time to get better. 

I feel like a terrible person.

I've been drinking for roughly 10 years due to depression caused by my panic disorder. Became an alcoholic about halfway in. I would say my alcohol dependency is pretty strong as I used it to self-medicate instead of going on antidepressants.
Last weekend I went on a bender and my liver has been sore since. I've not felt this dull pain under my rib cage for a long time; the last time was in 2017. It went away after a couple of days back then. 

Due to this, I've stopped drinking for two days now. At what point do I take myself to see the doctor?

Hi,

So I used to work out and exercise quite a lot and never had any problems with my heart, but recently I've started to get anxious about the health of my heart and have been paying close attention to my heart rate a lot of the time. I went to the doctors around a month ago and they told me I had above-average blood pressure and a high pulse but said it's probably due to high amounts of stress and my anxiety which makes sense to me.

I tried working out today but couldn't even get through a few sets of weights before I started getting what I think were heart palpitations every minute or so, kind of like my breath was taken away but just for a split second, which just made me super anxious and made me stop exercising just 15 minutes in. I've never had heart palpitations like this during exercise before, and I used to do much more intense workouts so this is a very new issue for me. I'm concerned because I'm not sure if this is just due to my anxiety and because it's the first time I've worked out in quite a while, or if it's a legitimate heart problem that I should be concerned about. I don't get chest pains or anything, it's just the very occasional (maybe once or twice a day) heart palpitation while not exercising and regular heart palpitations when I'm exercising.
I have a blood pressure measurer at home and the last time I measured it my heart rate was slightly over the average and my blood pressure was slightly over normal too. 

I'm not sure what to do. I want to keep my heart healthy by exercising regularly, but whenever I try to exercise I get heart palpitations that just make me anxious and very hesitant to exercise anymore. Even if it is just my anxiety causing these heart palpitations they are still very unnerving because it's a very unsettling feeling and makes me worry that I'll have a heart attack. 

Does anyone else have similar issues or advice? It'd be very much appreciated. 

Cheers

Hi,

I used to come on these forums almost every day for support with my anxiety and mainly my health anxiety, but haven't posted in quite a few months. This is because I've actually improved quite a lot, and I'd like to share my progress with all of you to show you that you can overcome your anxiety with time and patience. 

I used to suffer from Health Anxiety pretty bad, I was in constant worry over my health, I'd be hyper-focusing on symptoms which amplified them and made them seem much worse than they actually were, and any time I felt any sort of sensation I'd overanalyze it and instantly assume the worse. I was very miserable and couldn't see any light at the end of the tunnel, it really was the most miserable I've ever been in my entire life and I hated it. 

I established myself on the forums and made it my mission to not only find ways to help myself but to use all my knowledge I accumulated over my time on the forums and through my own experiences to help other people. By far the thing that helped me the most was CBT or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. To majorly oversimplify it, I pretty much taught myself not to freak out and instantly assume the worst every time I experienced an unusual sensation or symptom, and taught myself to think logically during these high-stress situations. Another huge help was 'The Anxiety Guy' on YouTube, he may not be for everyone, but his videos helped me out a tonne when I was super stressed and freaking out about my health. 
It took me quite a few months of practicing CBT techniques to see improvements, but I eventually got there. It was almost as if one day I just stopped checking for symptoms, and then didn't check them the next day, or the next, or the next, and then before I knew it I had gone a week without checking for symptoms or worrying about my health, and could finally go on with my life.

I still struggle with health worries from time to time, but I don't let those worries spiral out of control and overcome me anymore. 

In a way, health anxiety actually helped me. It prompted me to ditch a bunch of unhealthy habits such as smoking, drinking soda every day, eating a whole lot of junk food, among other things. If it wasn't for my run-in with health anxiety, I'm confident that I'd still have those bad habits and would actually be a whole lot less healthy than I am now. 


Anyways, I just wanted to make this post to show people that you can beat health anxiety. 
If I could, you can too. 

All the best,
Max

Hi everyone,
Generally I am craving for being among people, but lack social skills allowing me to get closer. 
Whenever I meet someone, I am terrified, my mind goes blank. And this moves to ""what-should-I-say-now,what-should-I-say-now"", ""they probably think I am boring/cold/rude"", ""oh,this is so awkward"", ""what if they think I am not worthy talking to anymore?"" etc. I need a moment to get used to them and realize that they are not going to eat me and I can actually talk to them (if they are still there of course).
During parties I am the listener and observer, and I need someone safe (usually my husband) to be beside me to feel comfortable.
I am also OK speaking in front of people, as long as I am prepared. But any change of agenda and if I have to  answer sudden questions I get light-headed, dry throat, go bright red, my heart wants to beat itself out of my chest, and really just want to turn around and run away.
But the real problem is this horrible fear of being left out, not fully accepted, never being invited to share time with those people I care about. In the past, I preferred just to leave thinking that I am not good enough for them to accept me. Once I was openly pushed away from a group, because I was the target of bullying, and they didn't want to have trouble because of me. Back then I already shut myself out and I didn't bother.
I volunteer in the community, I thought I got somehow close to couple of people and even thou the progress is really slow, I was OK with it. But recently one person from 'my' group was moving so I offered my help, but was told they have enough helpers. After that this person started discussing plan of action for the moving day with two others from 'my' group. This completely kicked me off balance. I don't think it was intentional, as I can feel I am liked and respected. And well, I know it is slow and the necessary closeness has not bloom yet, but still it hurts as hell. Later at home I ended up in teary mess. I wanted to scream ""What did I do wrong?"", ""Why am I being treated so different if we all started the volunteering at the same time?"", ""it's so unfair"", etc.
After calming down I started being angry at them. But this I can handle. I will not jump out at them, I know I suck big time when it comes to socializing. But I am learning how to improve.
The thing I am in need now is rather how to cope with this overwhelming pain of rejection, disappointment and how to prevent pushing them away due to my upset condition.

For a few months I've been experiencing anxious symptoms from tightness in the chest to rapid breathing, Which I have experienced before through panic attacks and stress, but the biggest problem I'm having is feeling exhausted and zoned out with a big dose adrenaline fueling my body/brain. It feels as if I'm walking around on auto pilot but also like I'm going a million miles all day/night. I'm also noticing a hightened level of emotions from happy to sad to angry and they can get erratic at times peaking randomly. I feel as though so much is happening in me and I'm not catching up or vis versa. Which then makes me feel overwhelmed.

I do work in retail and with these times I understand that could be urging these anxious feelings but am I alone in feeling like this? Is anybody else feeling this anxious, energised and exhausted feelings mashed together?

Hi friends,
The last 3 years I've been getting a series of strange head sensations, They generally stay for 6-9 months then stop for a few months only to return after being triggered by organic sensations similar (a head cold or over tired).
It makes me feel like i'm going to faint or 'check out' when i'm speaking to people face to face and makes driving difficult and unsafe plus generally feeling not ‚Äòwith it‚Äô 24/7.
Caffeine brings on the sensation 10x harder, even little doses like in painkillers affect me.
After the first belt of this and after many inconclusive doctors visits and MRI scans i spoke to a friend who also suffers from anxiety and said it is probably adrenaline being produced in excess which is causing the problem due to anxiety. It actually helped, went from a 8/10 to a 3/10 after a few days of trying to process this theory.
Problem is I can't shake it..Everytime i get a trigger (cold or over tired) it comes back.
 I'm reaching out to anybody who has had anything similar to this or may be able to help.
I can't find anything that ticks all the boxes online. After speaking to health professionals nothing has been resolved, nobody knows what it is exactly which makes me feel increasingly anxious and depression is starting to set in. It's starting to drive me crazy not to know what is wrong with me.
Symptoms:
Heavy eyes
Eyes sensitive to light
Ears ringing
‚ÄòGassy‚Äô feeling in head
Slight off balance
20 frames per second behind (based on a study saying 110 fps is standard) normal life speed
Constantly tired
Spaced out feeling (almost like being stoned)
Hard to focus long distances
If anyone has any input big or small it would be appreciated.
Thanks!

Hi,
I am having so much anxiety around having a 3rd baby. This has gone on for years but previously I have been able to tell myself we‚Äôll just leave it for a bit and look at it again in say 6 months or so. Now it has really come to the point where I feel its now or never. By the end of this year my children will be 7 and 5. I am so worried about the age gap being too big now. 
The thought of being pregnant again and the whole life change makes me feel so sick and scared. 
The anxiety is at its worst at the time of the month when my period arrives as I know I have to make a decision. The other time of the month I feel good and think yes I can have another baby it will be great, I will love it. Then when it comes down to crunch time I cannot commit. I completely freak out. I fall asleep then wake up an hour or so later in a panic. I wake up in the morning and feel this instant dread. 
This has been going on for so long now and I don‚Äôt want to keep feeling this way. 
I feel I do want another baby, i‚Äôm just so scared of going through it all again. I‚Äôm scared how it will change our lives and how my children will take it all. 
I feel I would love to experience another baby again, I just don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm past thag stage. I honestly feel its impossible and it all just makes me so sad and I am sick of feeling this way. A big part of it is not having any support, besides my Husband.

I have done something really stupid and I am very angry with myself. I have let my work colleagues and bosses down. I have apologised so many times but they dont believe me. I love the place I work at but they think I am a bad person now. I am very anxious about going to work tomorrow and feel like a failure. I am seeing my daughter today but I don't want to tell her what I have done. I live alone and have no one to talk to. Everytime I close my eyes the words just repeat through my head. Hence no sleep. O don't know what to do and feel like I am worthless.

I have been living a life of hell for almost a year. It all started off after coming back from a trip. I was stressed before hand and stressed during and I came back almost to a break down. I've had the following 
1- Extreme fatigue since august last year to the point where I need to sleep all day 
2- I've ended up with a million different tests thinking I've contracted a virus. Nothing keeps showing up. 
3- I developed massive ectopic beats almost 1500 a day confirmed by holter which sent me into a new panic and more testing. Heart  MRI's stress tests etc... all again normal and no explanation for the extra beats. 
4- I developed intolerance to standing up. MY heart just races when I stand and the ectopics go nuts. 
5- Recently I've started with twitching everywhere especially my legs. They will not stop from the knees down. Its been this way for month now. 
6- I then started to get internal vibrations whilst asleep in bed. I haven't had a proper night sleep in weeks. I just feel like my legs and body is trembling as soon as I start to doze off. 
7- Now I have tinnitus in ears almost daily and wont stop. 
8- I've been to 2 neurologist thinking and convinced I have ALS (motor neuron disease) from all the twitching. 
9- I've started to notice my left calf muscle where all the twitching is is smaller than my right and this sent me into a total spiral drive about the above ALS issue, I'm waiting to get further testing to prove what it is. 
10- I wake up every morning measuring the size of my calf for atrophy and I'm too scared to walk or run incase I feel weakness in one which will totally destroy me. 
 
 My mind is just going in circles all day. From ecoptics, to twitching, to tinnitus then I go back to ectopics and the loop goes over and over. The fatigue is almost debilitating. 
 
doctors think t's all health anxiety and a breakdown caused by stress so they threw benzos at me. I took them for a few days by the symptoms did not go away. this sent me even more into a mental break down because I'm thinking in my head if thebenzos didn't help then there must be something seriously wrong ! I've seen a couple of phycologist who are all trying this CBT stuff but my brain just sees the physical symptoms and is basically telling itself you're too smart to be tricked by CBT. 
 
 I'm lost at the moment !the only think I'm able to do is dull the fatigue and symptoms with alcohol for brief periods of time to get me through the day
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Hi everyone,
I've been contemplating this for awhile now and was wondering if anyone else has the same feelings.
I am blessed with a happy health son and just found out I have a daughter on the way. I have a good job, that pays well, and they know about my mental health issues and are very understanding about it. Married to the love of my life, we have had our ups and downs but ups definitely out weight the downs. We are currently building our dream home, which going to look amazing.
What I can't seem to shake is that I don't feel worth of it all. Not only in the sense that it's unbelievable that these things are working out, but am I out side of my true self. I grew up with very little money, but loving parents, and now find myself quite comfortable (which is amazing in the current state of our economy) and can't shake the fact that I don't think I fit this mold. Like an impostor almost.
I have, and continue to, work very hard for everything we have. Am I chasing a dream that isn't mine though..
Anyway, happy to hear peoples thoughts/stories.
Thanks as always,

Hi all. 
Around 5am on Monday I woke up to a sudden panic attack in my sleep and went to hospital completely unaware of what was going on (thought I was having a heart attack and shook so hard I couldn't walk).

There was no signs of anything wrong with me and it was ruled down to panic, albeit inconclusive results. Ever since then, from the moment I wake up I am completely short of breath, tense in the chest and haven't been able to sleep in fear of having another attack.

As I write this, I am absolutely exhausted but unable to fall asleep without receiving a sudden jolt as if I can't breathe. In fact, I think I've otherbreathed so much I've thrown my whole body out of wack and I don't know if practicing deep breathing has only made matters worse.

I have never had anxiety or depression in my life. I'm as chipper as they come but, even when I'm in a good mood, I still can't shake this off. Every night I get the muscle spasms, cold sweating and insomnia, and I'm worried this will never go away or allow me to go back to living my life.

Right now, I would just like to speak to someone who can tell me what I have and what I should do so I can at least know I'm doing the right thing. It's pretty terrifying to be left alone with this and worse what it means for the future.

Lately I've found a pattern on when my OCD is worse and better. When I'm more stressed or tired its worse and irritates the hell out of me.
Throughout the day its checking my car to make sure its locked when I leave it, I'll literally be checking the doors to make sure they're locked, pressing the lock button 10+ times, walking away  walking back to the car to make sure its locked and at times ive got back in the car to just get out again and make sure its locked. It drives me crazy.
When I leave home I take a 10+ minutes making sure things are where they should be, checking windows and doors, making sure EVERY switch is turned off. 
When I go to bed of a night I spend up to an hour doing everything mentioned above and when I am so exhausted from work or study I get so frustrated with myself and this crazy need to do these crazy things! In my head I'll tell myself I've checked everything and its OK but if I havent checked it enough or correctly I feel like I have worms crawling under my skin until I've checked everything correctly.

Its really starting to hit me now that my son has caught onto it. He tells me I've checked it already and its locked or turned off or whatever and he's started getting irritated at times too at what I'm doing. 

I have briefly talked about it with my doctor and psychiatrist and they haven't taken much notice of it, saying my diagnosis of bipolar is the number one concern when it comes to my management of my mental health. But this is driving me crazy, I have no reason to be checking so much but I feel this need to!
I'm thinking of going back to discuss it but worried they won't really take the concern seriously again. I don't care if its counselling or meds that will help it i just can't stand it any more!

i have struggled with social anxiety for about 12+ years at this point and was prescribed medication about a year and a half ago and everything was going well but over the last few weeks i have felt really flat and my anxieties have started creeping back up. most notably i recently went a short trip with a few friends and just felt as if i no longer belonged with that group and ever since i have avoided pretty much all contact with those people which sorta just leads to me feeling worse.
On top of my friends issue i feel like im wasting my time with everything that i do. nothing really sparks any joy for me, things just fill in time as i wait for the day to end and i can go to sleep. straight after high school i went into university where everyday was overwhelming until i finally had a breakdown and was unable to even set foot in uni again. a cycle repeated for about four years where i would attempt to enroll in classes and go, fail the classes, breakdown and take the second semester in the year off completely. i tried to get back into the rhythm of things but each failed class just added to my doubts and eventually i just gave up and did nothing. and now im doing some classes at tafe and they are going fine but i have no motivation for them. i donn't care if i pass or fail, i have no idea what job i want and i don't even have any real goals or dreams or things i want to achieve. i feel like im just doing these classes so im not wasting all my time. people always tell me just ""follow your dreams"" or ""work in what you're passionate about"" but i don't care about anything really so i end up just feeling lost.
its been 4 years since i finished school and im no closer to a career than i was straight after high school not to mention i donn't feel like i have any strong bonds or connections with anyone at all. i mean i have friends but i don't feel very close to any of them and i feel like they don't want me around most of the time but i get confused cause i can't tell if that's true or its just my anxiety.
i just feel really lost and really down. im not sure what to do or where to go and im really sick of just dragging myself through life but i have no idea what to do about it.
apologies that this isn't very well formatted but i was just typing whatever came to mind. any advice is appreciated.

hi all,

So today I quit my new job because of anxiety. 2 months ago was made redundant which was great financially however its made me very anxious again. I have always suffered with anxiety, even at my previous job in which I was bullied and went through hell with my boss and company. 

After 2 months of being without work I wanted to find something new and with out fail my anxiety has kicked in to top gear and it feels debilitating. Really bad feeling of worry and just generally never comfortable at all especially about learning new things. I have always suffered with it. I even had my pilots licence but its become so bad of late. I started medication after I was made redundant and started seeing a counsellor. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? Or can anyone offer some advice. 

Thank you for reading.

Hi all, 
I apologise for putting this relatively minor issue on here, but I have no one to speak to. 
I‚Äôm 35, live alone and suffer with Aspergers, anxiety, Dysthymia, depression, and ptsd. 
I haven‚Äôt worked in 3 months, and prior to that I was working full time (up to 55 hours a week) and had multiple breakdowns. 
yesterday my DES told me I had a new job as a petrol station attendant at 15 hours per week. I am grateful for the chance but I‚Äôm absolutely petrified of going outside again. I‚Äôve been so anxious to leave the house these past few months, plus my own personal issues. 
I have no spare emotional or mental energy just by surviving at this stage. I‚Äôm worried how I will react, and if I‚Äôll have anxiety attacks at this new job and how I will cope physically (due to chronic pain). 
thanks for reading.

Hello, 
I have previously posted on here when my boyfriend at the time was putting me down, he would comment on my weight and said that men would be more attracted to me if i was skinner. I went on to get engaged to this man, thinking that things would get better. He would commit to making me feel better and help me be the best i can be. There have been several red flags in our relationship, we had been dating for over two years and i still hadn‚Äôt been introduced to his grandparents who live about 20 mins away. Once we got engaged, there was no excitement on his behalf, no planning on having an engagement party or wedding plans.. nothing! I was so excited and couldn‚Äôt wait to make plans with him. 
He broke up with me about 4 months ago, i was suffering with anxiety and depression.. was doubting myself and that i was even attractive to him anymore. He left me, and since then we still live together and he has made more of an effort to make me feel attractive but not on committing back to being with me. I have worked on myself and continue to every day, I don‚Äôt see him making the same efforts and yet he says he loves me. I‚Äôm very confused and would love someone‚Äôs point of view on this.

Well. Writing this mid-panic haha

My thoughts have been spiralling hard. I can't say much, but I've been struggling with how to cope with my hate and anxiety about my mother being hospitalized. She's been horrible to me. Emotional blackmail, gaslighting, and sometimes worse, but the worse stuff's in the past.
I truly can't word this in any other way, but I hate her. I know, the horrible excuse of a son and whatnot. But I can't cope with this household. She mocks my depression, ignored my identity, it's all jolly fun!
And. she's been in the hospital for a month. Not from the virus. Just, stuff. 

My other family keeps saying I'll have to be 'nicer', as I tend to never speak to my parents outside of absolute necessity. And I get nauseous at the thought of having to tolerate her. I don't want her to die. I don't want bad things to happen. But now I keep feeling things in my own body and I think ""Am I gonna die?""

It's all a mess, really. I'm just so tired of living here. It's like my own [personal hell, where my only safe space is my room, and even that isn't sacred to these gargoyles. 
tldr: My emotions are mixed about my mother, and her hospitalisation has made it worse. What the hell do I do????
I'm sorry if this is in the wrong place...

I feel like I've been on a rollercoaster. The start of March my anxiety shot though the roof to the point I had pins and needles. It's only been in the last couple of weeks I've finally calmed down to normal stress for me. I've had gutt problems in the past, but this time it's been lasting for about 6 weeks.
I have 
Upper abdomen pain and sometimes feels tender to touch
Lower abdomen pain
Random sharp pain sometimes
A dull ache on my lower right hand side of my ribs
I'm not regular AT ALL and when I go it's not healthy
I have the worst gas
Cramps. Cramps all the time.

Does anybody else have these issues? I've been to the doctor and had blood tests and everything came back clear. I eat well, exercise, drink water, have upped my fibre. It's frustrating. And it is making me more anxious thinking I have cancer or something like that. So it's all I focus on üò£

Hi,
my first post with worries about my 13year old daughter. She has grappled with anxiety since she was 4. She has worked with a number of therapists and we have finally secured a clinical psych appt but not until August. Over the last few months her symptoms have escalated-triggers vary and of late it is small changes around our home-yesterday a new heater arrived and when she walked into the room and saw it installed she ran back to her room crying to please get it out of the house-she normally recovers after a few hours - but she has remained in her room refused dinner and breakfast - refusing to talk about it. Any ideas...... my husband and I are trying to help but struggle when she closes up and refuses dialogue etc.
thanks in advance

Hi All
I'm a guy in my early 40's with GAD, OCD and a mild physical disability (affecting one leg). Until 4 months ago I lived at home. I've been seeing a great Psychologist for a couple of years as well as a Psychiatrist. I've never worked, and would love to find ease into it by finding a part-time job and work my way up to full-time. I was hoping to find an agency that would hold my hand and find me a patient, understanding employer so I contacted a disability employment service 2 months ago, and still haven't had an induction interview with them! They won't even return my calls. I've looked at the reviews for disability employment agencies and they're all terrible. The whole job interview process scares me terribly!
So my question is, how have people who also struggle with anxiety managed to find a job? Do you have any tips? Thanks!

Hey,  I am worried about my son who is struggling atm with his anxiety and depression.  He is 26 nearly 27 and unable to find a job, never has had one but spent years getting to a better place with his mental health.  Now it has all gone up the creek with one comment made online, stupidly of course but we all make mistakes.  He was doing volunteer work and there was a complaint made to the company he did that for and now after 3 years of hard and loyal work for them they wont let him come back because of one mistake.  He had a mini mental breakdown today and I am at a loss of how to help as it was one of 3 things that happened today but this was the one that ended up breaking his spirit today.  Can anyone help this mother who loves her son very much

I suffer from severe health anxiety and have for the past 6 years which all started after my son was seriously iill and we came very close to losing him thankfully we didn't. Since that time my anxiety has gotten a lot worse these past 2 years have been so bad with my physical symptoms worsening to the point I'm googling my symptoms all the time constantly thinking I have some disease that relates to the symptoms I have at the time. I guess I just don't believe that even though my anxiety is so severe it can cause these weird sensations and symptoms in my body which with having health anxiety the symptoms just escalate my anxiety and I can't function at all. I'm constantly waking up anxious hoping I won't have a the symptom that day then when I do it makes me so upset and frustrated I think I must have a serious disease for it to still be there. Can anyone else relate to this and has the horrible scary physical symptoms that go along with anxiety what did you do to help I don't want to be like this anymore the Physical symptoms are horrible.¬†

I really struggle to sleep because I get really paranoid and anxious. I have a major fear of sickness so as soon as I get anxious and feel sick I spiral into a hole of feeling awful. I‚Äôve gotten up in the night multiple times to go into my mums room and ask to have a shower to try and calm me down. It‚Äôs really hard for me, I really want to be put on medication to help me because i‚Äôve been to a psychologist and the doctors and nothings working :/

I have this friend who has really helped me throughout my anxiety, he came into my life a couple of months ago when it started to get really bad. And even tho he has helped me with it, I was always scared of becoming reliant on telling him all my worries etc. Well I told him this after A LOT of overthinking and we had a really good open chat like we always do. Came to the conclusion that I'm constantly seeking reassurance from him, and needing him to validate my feelings. And he said to me that maybe we should talk a bit less about this sort of stuff which I 100% agree cause I don't want him to feel like my therapist, but we agreed that we shouldn't talk about it as much but he's still going to 100% support me and will listen to me if I ever need it.
 
And I've had a really good couple of last few days, and I've told him they've been good cause we talk pretty much everyday and he always asks how my day has been. But today had a not so good day and was crying and just sad etc, and I made myself anxious over if I reach out to him because thats what he said to but I don't want to seek reassurance from him because I haven't for a couple of days and I'm proud of me being able to validate myself, and if I talk to him about it I don't want to spiral back into feeling like I'm dependant on him for that.
 
He's a really great friend and the last thing I want to do is stop talking to him or scare him off or make him hate me. And even if I come to him about this I'll be seeking reassurance and thats too much to ask of him.
 
Feeling confused and anxious :///

Hi everyone - i am a consultant and have experienced increasing anxiety when it comes to working with groups or teams. This is only part of my job. When i find that i may ‚Äúwin‚Äù the work i have bid for, that involves groups or teams, i start to then wake every morning with sense of dread, sick in my stomach and the feeling of looming fear is with me all day. I start to try to flee (eg how do i get out of this work) or erratically seek other solutions (eg someone to do the work with me/co-present) but still the feelings remain. 
when I am doing the work, i am largely able to manage the stress/anxiety but the anticipatory aspect (which can go for weeks/months) is extremely difficult to manage and is impacting me a lot. 

So my question becomes, when is it ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù and the anxiety ‚Äúwinning‚Äù? Is it the right/best thing to work through the anxiety and increase our ability to manage it or are there times when we just accept it and avoid, wherever possible, the situations that trigger it?  
I am pressuring myself to learn through this, to be strong and successful when emotionally, all I want to do is run away and avoid ever doing this work (even though i value it and love the impact it can have for my clients). 

I would love to hear your insights and experiences. 
Thank you

But recently I've been able to count times where I was anxious about something for a day but then that feeling disappeared when I realised I was being irrational. It still pops up from time to time, where I excessively worry about something- it's happened three times this week alone. I got triggered today when I squeezed between a lounge couch and mattress to get to the other side and I started to worry about internal bleeding because it was a really tight squeeze across my stomach. It's been 7 hours, and now that I'm in bed my anxiety is getting worse because my stomach feels weird and hurts when I press on it- but I was full on dinner and dessert. I need reassurance that I'm just over thinking, and that there are other people like me.

Hello, 
I‚Äôm very new to this community and this is my first time posting on the forums. I guess I just need to get a weight off my chest as I haven‚Äôt got many people to talk to.
I‚Äòm 29 and have been suffering from anxiety on and off pretty much since I was a teenager. I have never sort professional help as my anxiety has stopped me from reaching out, although I came very close last year. My own mental health issues have often been eclipsed by that of family members who have actual diagnosed illnesses and so mine appear lesser. I often feel I take on their issues while mine fall by the wayside. 
Today I was made redundant from my workplace due to COVID-19, something I could sense coming, although it still came as a shock. For the last couple of years I have absolutely hated working there, however my fear of change and anxiety to job search stopped me from moving on. 
I have developed severe social anxiety over these last couple of years due to the work environment, a place that favors extroversion and confidence to actual dedicated and hard working employees. I often felt ostracized and lonely due to the social cliques that formed around me. 
Although I can see that this is somewhat of a blessing in disguise, I am now faced with the prospect of looking for work during this time of minimal job openings. As well as the prospect of having to navigate job interviews with my social anxiety. My anxiety levels are tittering on the very edge and I feel extremely lost and alone. 
I‚Äôm so hurt that I‚Äôm not valued as an employee or colleague and can‚Äôt help but feeling worthless and alone. It feels as if all the niggling suspicions in my mind have been actualized. 
Just looking for some advice or tips on how to move forward from this in a positive light? 
Thank you, 
PH :)

hi,

I'm new. I'm sure this has been asked before but can I quit my job due to mental health and be able to receive payments straight away (after claim processing for jobseeker)? I have the centrelink medical certificate. Or will I need to wait due to ""voluntarily ceasing my job"" (even though mental health is not voluntary)?

Thanks in advance.

Hi. This is my first time posting online about anything mental health related, so this is a bit terrifying.
In October this year I will be turning 18. I've recently applied to university, got my learners license, and have been applying to jobs to try and get my life moving. I've had severe social anxiety for as long as I can remember, and becoming an adult is somewhat scary. I have been feeling a deep urge to become independent, so while it is scary is is also exciting. 
One thing I'm worried about is the fact that I have no friends. I do home school after having severe anxiety attacks when I was attending school. My anxiety has stopped me from making friends, and the fact that I will be spending my 18th alone physically pains me. I've always wanted a group of friends, but I feel like my social anxiety has held me back in so many ways. I got my leaners license later than everyone else in my town (everyone got theirs as soon as they turned 16) and everyone has jobs and a big group of friends. It doesn't help that I moved here in Year 7, and the town I live in is very close-knit. Everyone knows each other, and I am an outsider. I didn't get to grow up with a group of friends due to my family travelling Australia when I was in primary school, and then in high school having to move schools because we had to move closer to my grandparents when my pop got diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Unfortunately he passed away in 2016, and the grief that I felt after he died also contributed to a growing anxiety and fear of the future.
Recently I also got diagnosed with anorexia, which is also terrifying because I don't know how it is going to affect my chances at university next year. I'm feeling really lost, alone, and tired. I haven't been able to sleep, and I hate hurting the people I love. My mum is worried sick all the time and I hate the affect I have on her mental health. I wish I could take that pain away from her, she's been through a lot herself and I feel like a burden when I add to her pain.
Sorry for the long post...but does anyone have any advice?

Hi all,
I've recently turned 25 and just gotten out of a toxic job that really exacerbated by severe anxiety to the point that I'd gone on medication.
Now working full time, recently turned 25 and feel like I'm still 18/19 and time is always running out on me, like I'm always trying to catch-up on adulting yet feel like I'm no longer young. Get nostalgic and depressed when I think about the ""better"" times.
 
Can anyone relate/share their journey/experience?
Much love to all,

Hi again
This is my second post, my anxiety and negative thoughts are getting to me again and I'm so tired of having them, 
At work, I feel as though I annoy everyone, I constantly say the wrong thing! 
Writing this down makes me feel better and my head aches a little, thank you to all the threads, for showing that I'm not the only one. 
I'm not seeing a psychologist, I feel pathetic and I should be feeling grateful for what I have. I haven't had anything bad happen to me, I'm afraid people will think I'm making if up. 
Thank you for reading, this has made me feel better.

Hi,
I can't sleep and my brain is thinking negative thoughts again, this time it's all the stupid things I've done at work, for example even though I know what I can lift and what I can't, I keep on lifting stuff or doing things a different way (things that don't have a procedure, of course) and people ""go off"" at me for lifting (due to osh) Then I get annoyed at myself for doing it, why, why! I try to say something positive about it but they just look at me as if I have two heads. This is what my brain is saying. 
No one at work seems to make any mistakes and even when I interpret something my brain seems to not get it and gets it wrong. 
I feel as if my common sense has gone and I can't do anything right and they think I'm stupid. 
And I'm being too self asorbed and this is wasting my life by worrying about it and I'm not enjoying my life or being grateful for what I have, 
And there are terrible things happening in the world and I'm still worrying about trivial things. 
Though it's 4:14am and the thoughts always come around this time. 
Thank you for allowing me to rant. 
It is frustrating, I want this to go, and when I am having an anxiety attack, I have to go through it, I can't seem to calm myself down, once I exhaust myself than I feel better and it finally leaves. 
Thank you

Hi everyone,
I have general anxiety about a lot of things but it is manageable usually. I have relationship/social anxiety which has induced minor anxiety attacks like the occasional vomit. 
However, I had an anxiety attack two days ago which was the most intense I've ever felt. It went for 12-18 hours in total. I was vomitting, shaking, unable to think about anything else but my fear, had a tight chest, etc. It is all to do with health. I had a scare a few months back about my eye, and potential cancer. Doctors convinced me I had it and then I spent the next 3 months waiting for the next appointment thinking every day I was dying etc, and then it turned out they made a mistake and I was perfectly healthy. Ever since then any symptom of my body feels extreme and I notice it like it is the only thing happening, and I google the symptoms (ive tried to stop this since) and find all these links to cancer, etc. I become overwhelmed with the idea that I am definitely dying and nobody will really care that I will be gone. It was so overwhelming, I tried meditation of all kinds, breathing exercises, and focusing on the present but nothing could help me escape those dark thoughts.
I went to a GP about my back. 1st doctor didn't even examine me just said it is muscle pain. 2nd doctor was great, did a full back examination, was 100 percent sure it was muscle related, but then also got me to do a chest x-ray just to calm my nerves and prescribed me a small amount of valium due to my anxiety attack. He has since rung me up and told me the xray showed nothing and that I am fine, and if the pain continues just see a psysiotherapist. But I still feel that feeling of not being able to be present and escape those thoughts of dying, even though everything that has been checked around these symptoms is checked. I am quite fearful of this anxiety attack happening again, because honestly I don't know how to escape it. I do have valium from the dr, but it didn't seem to do much for me.

Hi fam,
So my first relationship ended about 5 years ago when I was 19. Ever since then I've been getting ""triggered"" by anything that reminds me of my ex. Anything from a car the same colour, the same place we've been to together, any memory (physical or mental) causes pain in my chest and twists my stomach.
I haven't seen him since we broke up five years ago, haven't had any communication at all. I just keep replaying everything in my head and living in the past.
Only ever been in one other relationship since and that has also ended (amicably too), but I'm feeling so stressed about feeling worthy for a life partner.
 
Does anyone else have experience with this kind of obsessive, self-destructive thought pattern? How do you try to surrender the same thing (s) ever day? I always feel like I've moved on and then I'll get triggered again..
 
Thinking out loud..might not make sense

I‚Äôve never been diagnosed with anxiety and don‚Äôt want to self diagnose or self proclaim, as a disclaimer. 
Ive had stomach digestion problems for the past 2 years (I‚Äôm 15), and it may be IBS or another health condition, however I strongly believe it‚Äôs anxiety. It flares up when I‚Äôm in stressful situations or I‚Äôm anxious. The problem is, I am always anxious for the smallest things. For example, a tennis lesson two weeks in the future or school in the mornings will give me cramps, bloating, diarrhoea, and the sorts. Sometimes I can‚Äôt sleep when all I have is just a tutor session the next day. Therefore, I‚Äôm assuming my stomach is especially sensitive to stress and anxiety. However, the main source of my stress is my dad. He gets easily angered and I‚Äôve always been scared of him, I can‚Äôt meet his eyes and feel uncomfortable in his presence. He gets angered at me when I tell him I need to go to the toilet frequently or my stomach is hurting so I can‚Äôt eat. I feel stress when he does this to me, so my stomach gets even worse and it‚Äôs a cycle. How do I stop this? As I‚Äôm still 15, I don‚Äôt think I can remove him from my life easily, and my parents don‚Äôt bother to get medical feedback on my stomach, as they think it‚Äôs all my bad mentality and I just need to ‚Äòfix‚Äô it by myself. Any help would be appreciated.

Hi there, this is my first post on here but i really needed someone to talk to and see if any one experiences this and how they manage. 
Ill try and cut the story down, but my partner has always done FIFO, and most the time i dont mind it, i enjoy my own time and then having him home, so it works, but the last month but anxiety has been really bad, i normally sleep wonderful, but i havnt been sleeping well, and once i have one bad night of sleep i then am so scared about going to bed again and it happening again, so then the cycle starts. he was home for 3 weeks and the last week i started sleeping amazing again, then he got a new job, 3 weeks away 1 week home. and since has has been gone i have been sleeping bad again :-( im not scared about being alone, its more that im worried i cant sleep so i dont. 
Then last night he had beers with the boys and i saw a couple of girls there and freaked out :-( Im just not coping with him being away this time, im at work today and my chest has been tight all day, i just want to cry its horrible. i just want him to come home :-( 
I feel so overwhelmed with emotions and feel like im falling apart this week. i dont know what to do to calm myself and feel more myself and not be so needy towards him, any advice would be amazing. 
Thankyou xxx

Hello
I have suffered anxiety & OCD for years and years. I have kept it pretty well controlled with an SSRI. Lately everything with COVID and other stresses I feel my anxiety creeping up. I have had some odd symptoms and wonder if it's from anxiety or something more sinister. Which of course just causes me more anxiety.
I have a very very tight neck, like I have strained neck muscles. I have stabbing in my chest and a burning sensation in my throat. I also have one lymph node slight bigger than than the other. That was scares me the most. My pulse also seems to be bursting out of my neck.
Last week I had shocking heart beats in that ear but I had a lovely massage on my neck and that sensation has gone now. I want to see a doctor, but don't want to be a hypercondriac. Which causes me more anxiety. I am so stuck

Hey people 
I thought id start with an intro post. This is my first time ever doing anything like this im not sure how I feel about it to be honest but hopefully I can contribute to this forum and help myself at the same time . I never thought anything was wrong with me until the past couple of years. Im a plumber by trade so always tried to have that tough guy mentality .. that ""gotta get on with it"" attitude. But in the back of my mind ive always had these thoughts of  thinking im not good enough for anything and a general uncertainty about my life. I lost my job at start of the year because the company went into liquidation. Ive been walking around for the past few months with a constant feeling of self doubt. Feeling like someone has kicked me in my chest. I find myself constantly wondering and dwelling on things. Like something bad is going to happen but I dont know what.  Ive only recently come to terms that I have anxiety an ive had it all along but its just never been dealt with and i know that this is going to be one of the toughest fights of my life. 
I dont want to rattle on because there is probably people on here are far worse off than me. 
But I hope we all can find true peace eventually.

Hi everyone. I‚Äôm interested in hearing everyone‚Äôs stories of health anxiety and how they cope with it. I work in healthcare, with people who are terminally ill. And I find myself constantly panicking and obsessing over little symptoms of my own and convincing myself I‚Äôm really ill. I‚Äôm only 21 and I don‚Äôt have any major symptoms of anything. My paranoia has gotten to the point where I‚Äôm terrified to go see my doctor about anything, for fear of bad news. Which is very irrational. But I finally have made an appointment with my GP next week to discuss my health concerns, and organise a mental health plan to see a psychologist about my anxiety. Has anyone here experienced this? How do you cope? Did a psychologist help? I want to hear all about your experiences with health anxiety. Thanks!

Hi all,

Curious to get some opinions on a decision I recently took, if you have time.

4 years ago I moved into a boarding house, where I stayed for 2 years. I felt safe and had a sense of privacy. I got to know a few of the housemates very casually and become good friends with one. Everyone (including me) had jobs or was somehow occupied, and we all passed like ships in the night. I then left Australlia and was overseas for 2+ years.

I recently returned to Australia, contacted the same agency, viewed one of the rooms in the same boarding house, and signed a 3-month lease, thinking it would all work out well. The agent mentioned that all the previous tenants had left due to losing jobs amid COVID, so it was a totally different set of people. I decided (perhaps foolishly) to go ahead anyway and sign the lease.

Unfortunately over the following two weeks a string of incidents occurred...

* Two housemates loudly talking outside my door about ""the new guy"" and ""what's he up to"" etc.
* One of the housemates just talking and talking at me when I was trying to get back to my room and I ended up having to close the door on him because he wouldn't stop
* The police visiting once, apparently ""just to check up""
* A stranger tampering with the mailbox at the front then running off
* One of the housemates half-jokingly blocking my way when I was trying to walk out of the building
* A stranger asking me about someone living in the house as I walked out of the building
* One of the housemates two floors down shouting obscenities for about an hour so loud I could hear them from my room even with all doors and windows closed, and slaming doors so hard that I could practically feel the building shake

After all this I just didn't feel safe there.

When the shouting/door slamming occurred I panicked, phoned a family member and stayed overnight with them, and ended up spending the past two weeks with them. Just today I met with the agent, got my remaining belongings out, handed back the keys and quit the lease.

I feel like this all happened rather suddenly and maybe I overreacted?
Was I right to feel unsafe given the circumstances?

It seems like over a 2 year period the boarding house had gone from safe to unsafe.

Maybe the world is generally less safe due to economic disruptions, COVID, inequalities?

Do I seem obsessed with safety? But don't you kinda have to be, if the world really is becoming less safe?
Is it my anxiety or is this real?
What do you think?

My family of origin have abused, isolated and excluded me etc - even to the point of Christmases alone for the last 5 years. But yet they all get along with each other and have joy at events that I never get told about. I am always alone. I have tried to make/keep friends but it is not the same. They all have their families and commitments to those healthy relationships. I guess it falls apart for me because my family members are toxic and not healthy relationships - so it leaves me alone - all the time. 
It didn't bother me as much early on but the longer it goes on the worse I feel and my families treatment of me seems justified as obviously I am unwanted as I am always alone and never included. COVID certainly didn't help matters for me either - with the occasional coffee catch up with friends gone. I do like my own company (well, not really - but have been crushed by my family that I have such low self-esteem that my own company is safer than facing the world). However, the occasional inclusion would make a world of difference to me.
I don't know what I am posting for - maybe it might help to know if others experience the same - alone/isolation. Do people feel okay with it? Like I used to. Or does it affect mood, depression? I never had depression before all of this - I was quite charismatic and a bit of a social butterfly - always shy, but I interacted well with others. Now I am just a depressed, anxious empty crushed shell due to the people I loved most and who should have loved me most.
Also, I am sick of people making false promises - eg we will call you next week or whatever and never happens and emails that go unanswered. It only adds to the feelings of alone and unwanted/forgotten/not important. And this feeds into the depression. I am just not going to bother anymore. Does this happen to others??
Thanks for reading.

Hi first time on here and feeling anxious. I don't know what's happened it's not like I've had PTSD but lately I seem to stress or overthink the minute I feel some sort of ailment.  When this happens my brain goes into a spin and sit there thinking what the hell it could be. Currently sitting here worried that something is not right with me, because I feel like I have a sore leg, my tongue feels strange and I think my tear duct is dry. I say I think I feel these because I'm not sure if it's a symptom of panic or phantom because I'm thinking them up.
Never used to be like this.  I used to have the patience of waiting to see if things would pass or otherwise take action.
At the same time I'm scared of going to the GP sounding stupid or that there could actually be something. 
Anyone else ever feel like this?

Hi everyone,
so I experienced another attack this evening after dinner for no reason that I can pin point. Had the usual tight chest, short breath, pounding heart, sort of strange feeling as though the blood was rushing from my limbs (hard to explain), trembling, hot & cold and also find it heard to focus or think straight.
i find myself pacing the house trying to find something to keep my mind off what is going on in my body but struggled. Then managed to get myself to stop and lay on the bed and get out the log book that my physiologist told me to record every time I have a attack with: what happened, the rating how intense out of 100%, what I was doing at the time and also I I know what triggered it. After writing my log I  noticed I calmed down  after about half hour and felt a bit more human.
anyway I would really like to know if anyone has any tips of how to settle myself at the start instead of thinking ‚Äúoh here we go‚Äù and snowballing the feeling by getting anxious that it‚Äôs happening!

Hello everyone,

I have suffered from anxiety for many years, over 20 years. I have General Anxiety, Social Anxiety, Health Anxiety and OCD. Yes...what a real mixture! 

I have read many anxiety self help and awareness books, counsellors, medication, you name it i have tried it. Some things work, others don't. I always find myself relapsing into a spiral of anxieties.

The one thing that has started to ease my journey is being able yo talk to other sufferes, it doesn't fix it but it takes the edge off, something about feeling not so alone, weird , outcast or unusual.

I had some recent events that really set off some physical symptoms, twitching....yes twitching. As crazy as it is, no matter how much our health anxiety makes us feel we have underlying sinister diseases( and yes sometimes in life it can be a bad disease or symptom) , anxiety i have come to learn is a forceful symptom that activates out stress response.

If anyone has ever read about the stress response, chronic anxiety really does a number on our bodies. Anxiety is not just a bad thought or a panic here and there...it can be debiitating. It puts so much strain on the human mind or body, i think we at times need to not be so harsh on our selves. 

We are warriors together, nagivating our journey through anxiety. You are not alone in this, i too know how anxiety can wreak havoc on our lives.

Hi all!
I was just wondering if anyone else experiences this. 
Recently I have been feeling sick for no reason at random times, like random pains, throat stuff and a bit of nausea. I seem to be physically fine aside from this and was wondering if anyone who suffers from anxiety experiences this too. 
It will normally come out of nowhere. Like I'll feel sick after taking a sip of water and then worry that there's something in it. Does anyone know if this is just paranoia? 
Does anybody have any advice on how to deal with stuff like this?
Thanks!

Personally, music is one of the only things that helps me deal with my anxieties and depression, mainly by ignoring, which is probably less optimal then dealing with it but it helps me i guess. Does this help anyone else? I usually listen to rather pessimistic or ""emo"" music.

I started getting anxiety while at University about seven years ago, and ever since it has never gone away. I was able to manage it for a few years, but lately it has been getting worse. It feels like in a matter of seconds my heart rate can go from 0 to 10 over little stresses that wouldn't bother the average person. At work when I need to speak infront of my team I find that I often get mental blocks, where I am tongue tied and unable to gather my thoughts. As a result, I sound convoluted and often stumble over my words, which can be embarrassing. 

I am only now looking to get professional help. I was thinking about telling my manager, but I don't want special treatment or have the nature of my work changed so I have avoided this. 

Any tips on how anyone has overcome this issue would be appreciated.

Hi, I'm a 29 year old male, and this is the first real thing I've ever done regarding my anxiety.
Ever since I can remember I've suffered crippling social anxiety in most public environments. I avoid group situations and social interactions with people I don't know well, especially authority at work, females and confident looking people etc. I use my phone to avoid eye contact, I avoid the management office, I avoid phone calls, I've avoided invitations to the point of losing contact with potential or old friends. And when I'm feeling really worked up, I literally can't even get the words I'm trying to say out of my mouth, feeding the anxiety even further! 
But I'm not a total hermit. I do things like cycling with one or two mates at a time, solo travel, and I've done a lot of raving and partying, but over time I've realised that other than genuinely loving the music, this is kind of a coping mechanism as the alcohol, substances and loud music kind of mask the awkwardness and provide an escape for a few hours while getting my social fix. Albeit a shallow one.
When I was younger I thought that it'd just go away over time as I became an adult. And it looked like it was going that way as once I moved out of home at 18, as I gained friends, experiences and attention I never thought I was worthy of during high school. But those were the easy-go-lucky days before true ""adulting,"" and now I feel like I'm back at square one - 30 soon and still dealing with this debilitating problem that holds me back in most areas of my life. I can deal with daily tasks like work, shopping and exercise far better than when I was in my teens, but still usually with some level of anxiety most of the time.
So, my questions are, are there any people with similar experiences who can share what has worked for you? and what are the best steps to take regarding help?
I've never gone to a counsellor and I have no idea what kind of money I should expect to spend or even where to go. So any tips would be greatly appreciated, because I am so so sick of this!!

I have bad anxiety due to a work situation and how the workplace has treated me being bullied and then excluded from work. I was on workers compensation but they are trying to get me off it. I hate the thought of not working as I want to be productive.  I don't want to apply for disability, but my anxiety is overwhelming.  I've never had anxiety before this and I find it hard to sleep as the same ongoing thoughts go over and over in my head about how badly my employer has treated me.  I get anxious leaving the house.  Does anyone have any ideas to stop the repetitive negative thoughts? I try to distract myself and find something else to think about, but it doesn't work.  Thanks.

Hi everybody.
 
I'm a 31yo male who has been trying to cope with on and off anxiety for around 4 years now. Not exactly loving this experience to say the least.
 
To get down to what I want to say I'll just out right and say it.
 
 
I recently was sick with what the doctors told me was bronchitis, taken antibiotics 3 times now and every time things got better it came back, so that kind of set my anxiety off about to the point I keep thinking it might be something else. I have on occasions get intrusive thoughts that freak me out every now and again, throwing that in there because it will become relevant in the minute. I was feeling content and recovered last night while playing PS4 when suddenly my intrusive thoughts decided to say hello! I was doing something in the game when my thoughts just went ""quickly do this or mum will die"" which threw me off and made me paranoid and anxious as all hell. I got tight in the chest, heart beating faster, confused, and began coughing. Was hard to sleep aswell as I was tossing and turning all night with very little sleep accomplished. Woke up and my ribs are in a little bit of pain, coughing keeps creeping in, feel like I might throw up sometimes, and feeling guilty as anything where I want to cry but can't. What is wrong with me?
 
 
I'm trying to stay calm and relaxed but feel deeply regretful over that stupid intrusive thought.
 
 
Wish I was normal like when I was a kid.
 
 
Any feedback is appreciated, and thank you for taking time out to read my post. Very grateful.

Hi everyone, 
My anxiety has been so bad since I started a new job not long ago, I've always had bad workplace anxiety, low confidence and lack of assertiveness
The job is killing me, it's overflowing into and eroding my confidence, self esteem and social anxiety in my personal life. 
There's a lot of talking to people and I struggle with that at the best of times and there's a lot of responsibility.  I started drinking a week and a half ago and I don't drink that often nowadays.  I know there's not much anyone can do really but just wanted to vent with other people who suffer the same thing.

Originally posted by: Anna on 18 February 2013Is there anyone reading this who knows what this is like or can help me? I am a 28 year old mum of two children, the youngest just a baby, and since the birth of my second, have been going through alot of general depression and anxiety.  I've seen doctors and psychologists, and am reluctant to use medication as i'm concerned of the effects this will have on me breastfeeding.  The main cause of my anxiety is a fear of cancer, which has become absolutely debilitating over the past few months.  It's driving my partner mad, having effects on my oldest child, and preventing me from having social contact, as i feel unable to direct my focus to this phobia whenfriends are around (!).  I have little energy for anything else in life but constantly checking my body for signs that I have cancer, and monitoring myself for any new signs.  
My latest fear is leukemia or some form of blood cancer, due to seven unexplained small bruises i have found on one leg, and the fact that i can feel my lymph nodes, despite being reassured by my doctor that they are within the normal size range.  In the past year, i have ""had"": two types of breast cancer, cancer of the salivary gland, leukemia (seperate from this episode), brain tumor, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, skin cancer,bone cancer and lymphoma.  They have all been talked over with gps, who have explained the symptoms with fairly non-sinister causes.  Constant checking of symptoms online has fuelled alot of this in the past, but I have mananged to control this to a degree recently, to no avail.  If i do check the net, I start out intending to seek reassurance, only to wind up in a complete state of panic, calling my partner at work to let him know I'm dying, and with usual panic symptoms (sweating, racing heart, numb fingers and toes, pressure headaches etc).
It seems everywhere i go, everything I read, is saturated with the constant threat and reminder that cancer is out there, waiting to pounce on me.  I'm so scared, as i have two children who are my reason for living, and who need me.  I can't shake the image of myself lying in a bed somewhere with measured time to live.  I have always been scared and confronted of death, but this is getting out of hand.  The saddest part of this all is that i want to live so much, but am nott enjoying life at all for this stupid fear of dying.  I'm always asking my partner for reassurance and pointing out my symptoms to him, and although he does his best to deal with it by reassuring me and reminding me off all the other times it's turned out to be nothing, it's taking it's toll on our relationship.
Another niggling thought that makes the situation even harder is this: What if, in spite of all the false alarms, this time it's the real deal?  I mean. how many bullets can one dodge in a lifetime.  I have no family history of cancer, but figure someone has got to be the unlucky one, and I bet it's just me!  Sorry for the long ramble.  If anyone can relate to this, please let me know.  xx

I have a bump on my tongue and I‚Äôm so scared it‚Äôs cancer. Two doctors have seen it and said they don‚Äôt think it is cancer, dr google of course suggests it is.

So I had a really intense exercise addiction/ anaoxia (two go hand in hand) and it is worn off on my parents. It's so weird. Since getting help and recovery I can't stand to do any exercise, I think I've done enough for one lifetime. 
But they're really into weight loss and push me to exercise. Like 7 hour hikes (nope). Also they started to uses the same diet talk, talking about losing weight and being fat. It's super triggering, but also really sad that maybe my obsession with ""health"" has made them unhappy. Either that or I'm super sensitive to diet culture. Maybe it's been there all along and I'm just noticing it now. Honestly just wondering if anybody else has experienced this, like I see eating disorder behaviours all the time in my friends/ family and I hope it wasn't me that introduced it to them. idk

So I'm a 24 year old man who's lived most of his life sheltered from life. I live with my parents, I've never had a job outside of working alongside my dad and ever since finishing high school I've done pretty much nothing with my life. I've always distracted myself from everything, the thought of going outside into the real world fills me with anxiety and I have such a strong fear of failure that i feel like I'll never be able to turn my life around. The thought of applying for jobs scare me, i want to get a driver's license one day but driving is also a fear i have, I've thought about maybe doing some kind of courses or working towards some kind of certifications/trade and even doing volunteer work as i think it might help push me forward and out of my comfort zone, but it's all just very daunting

Hey there :)
I haven't been on here in a while, but I just needed a place to vent and maybe reach out to anyone who is or has experienced something similar.
I'm 16 years old and in year 11 at school, where it is about a term before I submit my first lot of assessment that will contribute to my ATAR next year. I have dealt with pretty severe anxiety since I was young, and lately I've been feeling that the self-doubt I have about my school work and future is becoming unbearable. I'm really anxious about my grades at school as I want to do well and please my family and not fall short of both the expectations they have for me and the expectations I have for myself. I do pretty well at school, getting straight A's, but I'm so anxious about failing and not getting the ATAR I want and need to get into the course I want to do at university (Veterinary Science Honours, ATAR 99). I'm becoming super anxious about studying and completing assignments where I'm sometimes finding it hard to sleep at night, and I'm anxious if I'm not studying or doing my schoolwork. 
I'm scared to finish year 11 and get my results back for the year and hear the award recipients for our school awards night as I'm afraid of not receiving an academic prize like I normally would for the fear that the people around me will think that I am stupid and didn't work hard enough. I'm becoming reluctant to tell my parents my grades too (even though they are not bad) because I'm also scared that they will think I'm not as smart as my sister and that I am dumb. 
I'm even more scared to finish year 12 and see what my ATAR is. I'm terrified of not receiving the required ATAR (99) I need and not getting into university (even though I know there are other pathways) because I feel that it will make me look like a failure to my friends and family. I'm scared of how I will react to my ATAR if it's not good enough, specifically, I'm scared I will take my own life if it's not good enough.
I know this sound so dramatic and so stuck up and petty, but I just needed to get all that out. 
Thank you for reading if you got this far :)

Hello everyone. :) New here, so here goes...
I'm a young woman working full time in a healthcare sector. Recently I have been struggling under the demands of my employer to reach unrealistic high targets, and being an essential worker during this pandemic. I have been experiencing conflict with colleagues and management which has further exacerbated my anxiety and depression, and my 'imposter syndrome'.
I have difficulty expressing my stress and frustration at work, and often don't realise when I am communicating aggressively or my body language is conveying a negative message. I am described by almost everyone who meets me as a kind, warm, shy, and caring person, with the best laugh in the office lol. I don't intentionally mean to come across aggressive and its probably more anxiety driven. However I have recently received feedback from management that I have been aggressive towards them and they feel I have attacked them on several occasions.
I've been questioning myself, am I aggressive?, or are they possibly misinterpreting what I am trying to convey. I guess I don't like to think of myself as the kind of person who is aggressive towards others, I'm struggling with that concept, part of me want's to go and apologise and admit to everything because I don't like the feeling of conflict, and part of me is thinking if I did say something, it would always be with the best of intentions, and it was what I felt appropriate at the time. 
Either way it isn't sitting right with me, I've noticed myself toggling between feeling angry towards management, and then shame towards myself, and its this constant tug of war in my mind. Am I really that person?. And I think maybe because I'm currently experiencing burnout- to the point where I called lifeline for the first time ever at 3AM this morning due to feeling overwhelmed and having anxiety attacks- that I might even be unintentionally externalising this stress and anxiety through aggression.  I have sought out mental health support through my organisations EAP and also see a psychologist external to the organisation as well. I want to address my behaviour, and change for the better, but not sure if I'm being too critical of myself.
I'm wondering if anyone else on here has experienced something similar. How did you deal with the anxiety, guilt or shame when coming to terms with a behaviour that you aren't proud of? how do you deal with receiving negative/constructive criticism?. 
Thanks for reading!

Hi everyone,
I am currently in my final semester of my masters for accounting, with no extracurriculars nor much experience and I feel hopeless. 
I have social anxiety issues which also lead me to have poor social/communication skills and have low self esteem. I never really had the courage to attend any career fairs or networking events nor volunteer. I was planning to bring up some courage to start working on this this year but with the current circumstances.... (I live my parents who are 60+ with poor health).
I am 27 y.o. yet only have ‚Äò2 years of retail experience‚Äô ... which I really wouldn‚Äôt consider as experience as it‚Äôs my mum‚Äôs business which has already closed down.
I‚Äôve applied for some internship programs during the first year of my masters degree, but wasn‚Äôt successful. I was able to get one interview but I got far too nervous during the interview I stuffed it up. For our uni‚Äôs internship program I was able to reach the ‚Äòassessment centre‚Äô stage. However, I completely freaked out during the presentation and wasn‚Äôt able to make it through.

I am completely lost and I‚Äôm not sure what to do at this point....? I haven‚Äôt gone to a counsellor because I don‚Äôt want my parent to find out about this (they have my Medicare card and would ask where I go..since I don‚Äôt have any friends).
 I am no longer eligible for internships, not enough experience for a graduate program...and I am hopeless at interviews. I really don‚Äôt know what to do at this point in time...?

Story of my life,.self
inflicted fantasies, about someone from my past. Someone who I was cheating with while I was living with my partner at the time. I was only 22. I feel very guilty now as I was  so wrong. A lot of the details I cant even remember. At first it was just a matter of fantasising about happy memories, and what might have been. Now it has become a matter of obsessive thoughts. A year ago  I took it too far, found contact details
and  made phone contact after 40 years, it started well and deteriated. I became obsessed with meeting up with him.The actual meeting went reasonably well ..My hubby took me to see him but doesnt know the full story. Then 2 months later another phone call which in my
opinion  started ok and then deteriated. Mainly because I started talking about my guilt from the past. So now my mind constantly  goes over and over the
conversations .. what I should have said and what I could have said. Its been 6
months since  last contact.  He has never contacted me, but has been
friendly and kind the 3 times I have spoken to him. We are both married to other
people for more than 35 years. and to complicate it even further, both men know
each other through business, not as close friends but they also have friends in
common through their industry. My hubby  has no idea how tormented my mind is. I am  constantly analysing each conversation, and knowing I stuffed it totally. All I wanted from this renewed contact was friendship. But he has moved on with wife family etc., and rightly so.   He did say a few confusing things in first conversation that totally had me confused and misread the situation, leading me to talk too much and raise the past, which I shouldnt have done so I feel that he was partly at fault for me  saying some of the things I did. My mind just swings from one scenario to  another, wondering if he thinks Im crazy.. which I most likely am. Now I just want to forget the whole thing I want the unwanted thoughts to stop, I want my guilt to stop over what I did then, and I want my secrets from my husband to stop. I cant tell him, but if I could stop the thoughts I would be happier person, and then I could re connect with my hubby , who is a good man, and loyal to me always. Ive googled everything I can, read a lot of self help books, seeing a psychologist, on meds to help with OCD. In total this has been going on for approx 14 months.  Any perspective on this would be greatly appreciated.

Hi there,
I have severe depression, BPD and anxiety. I have been seeing a guy for a while now, and I have realised I have anxious attachment disorder, largely due to childhood trauma. Whenever he doesn't/hasn't messaged me for a day or more, I get severely triggered to the point I feel debilitated and all I can do is sleep. When he goes out with his friends, I'm constantly panicked/worried that he is going to find someone more attractive than me and that I'm going to lose him. I feel like I have prioritised him over everything in my life, even above my own needs. 
 
Does anyone have any advice? :(

i'm needing help on ways to deal with social anxiety asap, 
i've always had anxiety, but since the start of this year, i've noticed its starting to get a tight grip of me. i get so anxious when even my closest friend who i've known for years & who i live with asks me to go to the shops with her because im scared or that im going to be to awkward. i've also noticed none of my last remaining friends ask me to hang out anymore. but deep down i know i'm the one to blame for as i usually pull out last minute or say im ""too busy"" when really im at home in my bed avoiding conversation. ive also notice im starting to get my words jumbled up or my sentences are slurred.
 im trying so hard to push myself to be more social with friends but i find it so damn hard and i can slowly see the friendships/relationships i have with people disintegrate in front of me. please help .

Hi everyone. 
I live with my best friend and she doesn‚Äôt understand my anxiety. I have explained it to her many times. Anytime I get into a panic and try and seek support from her she invalidates me because I have such a good, stable life at the moment. Which I know that, but anxiety doesn‚Äôt discriminate haha. In a recent panic attack when I went to seek her support she told me I was being dumb and has now compared it to a toddler throwing a tantrum over not getting a lollipop. I love her to bits but don‚Äôt know how to deal with this as it is upsetting me. Any help as to whether I‚Äôm being ridiculous for being upset or any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Ive been with my partner for 6.5 years. I have been an anxious person my whole life, but it was 2 years ago that I had my first panic attack, which spiralled into a period of really bad anxiety. 

When I first was going through this, my partner pretty much rolled his eyes and was like get over it - he never had experienced it and therefore didn‚Äôt understand it. He also had his own serious health issues to focus on (he has Crohn‚Äôs disease). 

Through his health journey with his Crohn he too felt anxiety and could finally see it from my perspective. 
Fast forward two years and he is in a much better and spot and so am I. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack for about two years and have been able to successfully manage my daily anxiety. However yesterday I had a moment which put me on the verge of a panic attack (I managed to calm myself down). Whilst my partner was actually good in that moment, later that night he was acting whack and I found out he was on edge because I was anxious. We then moved on as I was feeling better today. 

I have been anxious this past week and yesterday it just came out. Whilst I was feeling better today I was a bit preoccupied and more anxious than usual and was focusing on health stuff today. My partner got annoyed and then I confronted him and asked what was up - he told me that I just need to get over it, that I‚Äôm choosing to be anxious and choosing to fixate on things which make me anxious. I replied and said I‚Äôve actually been great lately and haven‚Äôt had an episode like that in a long time and he replied with you always say it never happens, or it‚Äôs only this once, but is that actually true...It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre back to where you were two years ago! (He said this in a tone of annoyance). He also said that I make my life harder than what it should be by being so anxious. He then proceeded to call me miserable after I got upset from what he said to me. 


This really hurt me, because he always Says that I want you to feel comfortable with talking to me about being anxious, anxiety etc and then I do and he is responding with this. 


I understand it can be frustrating, but also I don‚Äôt think those words or that attitude is particularly helpful. I realise that the thinking isn‚Äôt logical, I‚Äôm aware of when I start to get anxious - I‚Äôve been dealing with it long enough!!  


I need some help / advice on how to navigate this. I feel like my anxiety is annoying him and I‚Äôm becoming a burden. :(

hi !!! I have OCD, anxiety, depressive tendencies, and I'm currently going through the process of inquiring about an Asperger's diagnosis (long story). recently my girlfriend broke up with me (she said that it was because she was struggling to handle a relationship and mental health issues and school), but she said that it was a mistake and she still loves me. I miss her, a lot, and I know that I'm only 18 so realistically it probably isn't what my mum deems as actual love, but I feel as if I love her and I want to give this another chance. 
my mum, my dad and my best friend all think that the decision is a horribly bad one to make, and my parents are berating me for it and saying that I never listen to people's advice and that getting back together with her is setting myself up for failing my hsc (i want to achieve high marks and my parents have high expectations, and they dont want the past years efforts to end in a bad mark and a breakdown). 
my OCD has become a problem with this tho, because I'm needing constant reassurance lately that my best friend and my parents still love me, and that they don't hate me. its become an obsession for me, and anytime my best friend sighs or doesn't reply back to my text messages, the thought that she hates me and doesn't want to talk to me and finds me annoying just repeats over and over and over and over again in my head, and I feel as if i can't escape the thought and the anxiety that it induces. 
does anyone have any tips on how to deal with obsessions and obtrusive thoughts in regards to relationships?

Hi!
Recently I've been dealing with some pretty severe anxiety, which has led me to begin worrying about some things. However the things I've worried about are, well... Odd. I don't want to go into specifics because (as said by the title) I feel really silly whenever I have to explain them to someone (I try to avoid explaining unless it's someone like my psychiatrist). This combined with worrying about only a couple of things has led me to believe that maybe I don't even have something like generalized anxiety disorder, that maybe I'm impossible to treat as I don't actually have a problem. I suppose I wrote this as I've been feeling pretty hopeless recently and I wonder if there was anyone else who maybe has dealt with something similar.

Because I don‚Äôt want to disappoint my family‚Äôs expectations, I choose to shut up when I‚Äôm tired and sad. Sometimes mum say, who is not so tired in this society, how can you be emotionally weak? Don't be a person who spreads negative vibes. 
I am so sad everyday because every time I try to open up my thoughts, it seemed like spreading negative vibes, so I chose to shut up every time.
Slowly, I become a numb person, and I no longer like to talk, because I can't say it anymore, All i feel is numbness. 
no one will listen to what I say anyway. If they listen, no one understands it anyway. 
Since I was little, I was educated: ""Don't be emotionally weak. 
So, slowly, all of my emotions are suppressed, and the bad emotions became a symbol of weakness.
When I suppress myself for too long, I will seem extremely strong on the outside. However, I feel like a shell, just like an egg shell, and can actually be easily destroyed with a tap.
I am like a string that is tight all the time, every step of the way is cautious, and every step is startling.
Because of this, My thinking also becomes slow, the efficiency of doing things would be low and there are no ways to concentrate.  It is a mess in my head, as if I had lost the function of organizing language. Whenever I wanted to say something,  There are only some fragmented things in my mind, which are messy and chaotic. Then I force myself to be full of tasks every day. As long as today‚Äôs task is not completed, I have a strong sense of guilt.  It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve wasted my time and I will become seriously anxious.
But even I have so much anxiety, I don‚Äôt say it. so I began to repeat the above in a dead loop.
I don‚Äôt want to move, I don‚Äôt want to talk, I don‚Äôt want to go out, I don‚Äôt want to see people, I feel extremely tired, but I can‚Äôt stop, I feel just like a machine, turning and turning. I cry everyday.

Hello
This is all undiagnosed and we are in the process going to neurologists  and psychologists  but my son has been having these attacks at high school much like anxiety attacks but they have been getting worse where he goes unconscious. Now he has has two episodes of walking out of class with no recollection of doing it. Once he was followed and he was in the carpark saying he waiting for me to pick him up and today he walked 1km down the road and found himself outside school not knowing how he got there. I was thinkimg panic disorder but now this is different. Has anyone had any experience with this?

I'm a girl in her first year of uni, and I'm struggling with agoraphobia.
It mainly started at the end of last year, where I contracted an awful virus. As a result, I dealt with severe nausea for a month, my worst nightmare, as it confronted me with the possibility of facing one of my worst fears, a fear of throwing up. I also had difficulty swallowing (did not eat anything besides crackers + toast for a month), and heartburn. It absolutely ruined my life. I was hoping to get into medical school, but with the virus, I was unable to attend for a while or have the best mindset for studying and my grades went downhill significantly as a result. I was also doing with family troubles at the time, particularly with my father, who was abusing my mother. I won't go into too many details now due to the character limit, but long story short: for my mother's sake, I had to force myself to get back into the swing of life sooner than I was ready, and I believe I have a lot of trauma associated with this.
Eventually, my virus healed and I was able to go around, but I realised that some things seem to have changed about me - I had difficulty eating around other people (I'd either have difficulty swallowing, or feel nauseous). I think the fact that I was so conscious about this made it much worse. Nonetheless, I was still able to go out and about. But ever since coronavirus + uni shutting down, this has gotten so much worse. Simply leaving the house gives me so much anxiety that I begin sweating, feeling nauseous, getting dizzy, shaking... you get the gist. And being aware of that makes me more anxious and I keep thinking about it - this worsens the symptoms. I don't know how I'll deal with uni opening back up and having to go back to face-to-face classes again.
Just then, I decided perhaps the best thing to do would be to talk about it, so after 9 months, I decided to open up to my mum. Upon seeing how concerned she looked, I ran to my room before I could keep talking and started crying; out of guilt. I hate burdening her. I don't know what's happened to me, or why I'm like this. I want to talk to a doctor about it, but the doctor I'd been seeing for the past 14 years JUST retired (worst luck!) and the thought of seeing a new one makes me even more anxious.
The reason I'm writing this post is because 1) I feel writing and expressing my feelings always makes me feel better, and 2) I am hoping someone will have some much-needed advice on how I can cope with this :(

Its has got to the point where I have not attended interviews for work. I am forcing myself to get out of the house and into the public but it is getting harder. I am lucky that I have a very supportive wife but I am feeling very guilty of not helping support the family. And now this fear preventing me going to interviews obviously means I dont get a job. I feel all this has me in a downward spiral. How do I get out of this.

I feel absolutely ridiculous. This will be my third post. Since March I've had really weird symptoms and with the weird symptoms my anxiety has shot through the roof. Atleast 50% of the time I feel my body is in panic mode. I have a nervous/tight tummy, my chest is right so I find it hard to breath properly. 
I've been getting pins and needles or just rubbery feelings. It's never in a whole leg or a whole arm, it's just parts of it. So it'll be like a part of my hamstring, or a part of my calf muscle, or a couple toes. I also get random itches or skin crawling. I get skin crawling over my stomach. I have this sick feeling to my stomach something is so very wrong üò≠üò≠

My doctor has given me a referral to see a neurologist in 2 weeks. I'm now so worried he will find something. My doctor thinks it's just my anxiety, but he'd rather give me the assurance.

Do you think this is anixety?
I cannot stop thinking and I'm so focused on every little physical symptom I'm feeling. I'm so scared.

And I'm trying so hard to help myself. I keep busy, I lift weights and go for walks/runs. I eat well, sleep as well as I can. I do try breathing but I find it difficult. Mindfulness is something I absolutely avoid as I focus on the tingling. Right now I have tingling in my shoulder blades.

Hi All
Having a torrid time with health anxiety. I had a medical scare about a month ago. Once given the all clear I was fine. But then a few weeks later I had tingling in my right arm and fingers. I had had this before due to a suppressed lunar nerve, and knew it was likely that. But for some reason I saw the need to ask Dr Google. 

Seeing MS up the top of the search results has put me into a spin. Since then I have experienced a variety of symptoms. Burning in my legs, restless right leg, numbness that has moved around in my right foot, and weakness in my right leg. My GP is convinced it‚Äôs anxiety but has referred me to a neurologist for peace of mind. 
I‚Äôm also so in tune to my walking pattern (read that MS can change your walking style) that I think about absolutely every step and has made my leg quite uncomfortable.
I have had symptoms for about 3 weeks, and barely a minute doesn‚Äôt go past where I think of MS and how I‚Äôll deal with it if diagnosed. Bloody annoying as I know it‚Äôs likely anxiety. 

Just thought I‚Äôd share my symptoms, as if there‚Äôs anyone else out there feeling the same they won‚Äôt feel as alone! 

Would love to hear from anyone else experiencing something similar.

I am 2 years old. I have had OCD and anxiety my whole life, but never as bad as the past 2 years.. 2 years ago I started feeling really dizzy and weak and work constantly, so I decided to take leave and then never went back.. Ever since then, I feel dizzy literally everyday (unsteady, headspins), I feel weak and exhausted everyday, I get a tight stomach (like a fullness feeling) pretty much everyday, I have weird heart flutters, headaches, de-personalisation, blurry vision, get out of breathe so much, heart pounds at the slightest activities etc.. and frequent panic attacks. Im terrified that I am might have something wrong with my brain, like a tumour, or something wrong with my heart.. Ive had a few blood tests which were clear, had an ECG which was clear and also saw a neurologist which said I was fine and it was anxiety.. But all of those tests were early on in my symptoms and they have gotten worse in the past few months along with my panic attacks. Id love to get an MRI to have a piece of mind, but I cant leave the house because if my panic attacks let alone go for a scary test like that. 
 
Does anyone else get symptoms like this from anxiety????? Thank you in advance xx

Hi, this is my first time posting to these forums so hopefully I don't ramble too much.
I'm currently in year 12 and I suppose to an extent, it does not help that I'm under constant pressure in regards to SAC's (assessments), but recently I've been feeling as if I'm 'going crazy'. 
It's hard to describe how I've been feeling other than just like everything has been out of control, and it's been at its worst this last week. Everything really started to spiral out of control during the COVID-19 isolation period which is when I first started experiencing panic attacks. These panic attacks were horrible at first, with the primary concern being a feeling of dissociation, or derealization to be more specific, whereby the world around me felts really hollow. It's something I cannot describe. 
I've always had problems with searching stuff up online to try and self diagnose, and I suppose it all started to spiral when it came to my mind that I may be developing schizophrenia. I know it's highly improbably, and to this day I don't believe I am going to become schizophrenic, but recently there's been times where I analyse each and every thought as to assess whether or not I am doing stuff that the internet says may indicate schizophrenia. 
Some of these symptoms include feeling like I'm seeing stuff in my peripheral vision, however I am sure that this is just my anxiety telling me that something is there, when it is not. Furthermore, I sometimes find myself smelling a smell such as smoke when there is no explanation, known as 'phantosmia', but I also believe this can be attributed to anxiety.
Another concern is a feeling that has come back to me. When I was young, during a period of flu I would rarely experience this feeling where the scale and weight of objects would feel strange and off to me. It happened when I closed my eyes and I felt like I could see shapes changing size which distressed me. However, recently during panic attacks, and potentially at times where I'm extremely tired, I feel this feeling again. It's the feeling of losing control that gets to me and I cannot shake it, recently I have dreaded this feeling coming back to me.
Anyways sorry for the long post, but I just want to know if anyone else has these experiences, and if i should be concerned. 
Thanks

Hi. It has been a while since my last post, a bit has been going on. My issue is, however, that lately, I've been noticing some more anxiety and that I've been feeling like I'm not good enough.
I think some of it stems from work as I am on contract in a call centre and there are so many KPI's that I need to make and if I do make them I still get told I'm doing something else wrong. I am in the process of job hunting as I know I'm not there much longer, but I have noticed it has affected my anxiety a lot.
I also think it has to do with an interest in a friend that I have known for some time. I've been out of the dating game a while and I've always found him attractive, but at the back of my head I keep getting 'not good enough'. It has also been adding to my anxiety. I have been considering dating again so I'm not sure if my anxiety could have been triggered as a result.
I guess I'd like to know how you boost your self-confidence when you're feeling low? 
Thanks

This seems like a merry go round for me. I am currently going through a rough patch with my health and my anxiety level is at maximum. I was in tears with my GP yesterday, and for a 63 year old bloke that is not a good look. But she was reassuring and I have started on the latest journey to find out what are the steps forward to get past this set back. I have chronic lung issues, no cure just management, and I have a deep seated fear that my life is coming to a premature end. In reality I don't know how long I have left, it could be longer than I am convinced it will be.  I feel quite emotionally fragile, and it drives my wife spare, so I try to suppress it as best I can. I do have an outlet away from home, I do some community radio, but as with everyone else I am locked in more often during the pandemic. This post is just a vent for my frustrations, as I am resigned to my ongoing health issues and the decline of my quality of life. But, it scares the hell out of me.

Hi guys, I‚Äôve just recently started a relationship with a girl i have been into and really cared about for a long time. We are both 18 and we have been only dating for a month now but i have been diagonased with mild ocd since i was around 16 and at the start of the relationship, i suddenly one day had no feelings for her felt like dead around her even though i knew i loved her. This lasted for a week and then slowly went away as i realised it was something with my anxiety. I had a couple good weeks feeling normal after that but now over this week i feel like i literally have no feelings for her, i don‚Äôt get the same feeling when i see her or with her, i almost feel depressed and guilty when around and thinking about her because i‚Äôm scared i don‚Äôt have feelings for her anymore even though i don‚Äôt want to lose her. I keep noticing other girls now when i didn‚Äôt before and it‚Äôs really scaring me, is this something to do with OCD, is it some sort of depression, will these feelings for her return because all i want to do is love her like i used too. Hope this made sense

Right now I'm in a pretty bad place, full of panic and over analyzing every small feeling - twitching/pain/subjective weakness etc and trying to short circuit it with logical and rational thoughts.
I always remember what a psychiatrist told me at the beginning when all of this started... I will always have anxiety however my control over it will get better and there will be times it comes back but my ability to control it will mean the fluctuations will get less and less. This has largely been correct. There were times at my worst when I was frozen and shaking uncontrollably on the bed thinking the worst... I haven't had that in 6 months.
It has been since October 2019 when I noticed weakness in my arm and then my leg. Then the twitching started in my right leg. I can honestly say these 2 areas haven't progressed any or anything noticeably in 9 months... This logically should put my mind at ease immediately... but the anxiety in my brain will try to counter it by saying 'what if you do have something serious, but it's just a slower form of the disease' I then try to short circuit that thinking by knowing that if something is very slow (even though not realistic), then it's still okay.
Right now I have trouble in my articulation. I noticed a few nights ago that I was swallowing too much (maybe some allergies) and a few days later my tongue felt tired/sore and I could articulate as easily. I also know I'm thinking about this too much which is making something that has been nearly a subconscious movement in to something I'm analysing for each and every word spoken. This has happened before and went away, which should put my mind at ease immediately but again my brain will counter the reasonable/logical thinking by saying 'what if it is getting weaker and you can't cope anymore?'. I know this is impossible, if you can't move something then you can't move something. It's as simple as that.
Despite my logical thinking making overwhelming sense, the illogical/irrational thoughts still pepper away and come and go with intensity. Some weeks I feel like me again and others (like now) the world looks like a different place. I know through my own experience that it will subside again however practice makes perfect eg. mindful meditation/positive assumptions etc. If you're reading this and at the beginning of your journey, just know that it does get easier, and if you fall again, it's normal. You will come out of the fog.

Hey,

I'm pretty new to all of this, in a way. I've been dealing with anxiety since I was a kid but have only started to acknowledge it/understand it in the past year. However, after I acknowledged it, it has become much worse, and after the recent separation with my partner, it taken over my entire mind.

I can't go a single day without shaking and feeling extremely vulnerable in my self. I've cut down of my drinking habits and try to do things that will calm myself down, but due to a lack of friends and motivation I feel stuck in my head a lot of the time.

I feel like I'm the only one that could be feeling exactly how I feel and that thought really isolates me. I'm unsure of myself and have lost all my self confidence and enthusiasm. 

I'm not like who I used to be, and my confidence has really deteriorated. The anxiety makes me feel sick and helpless, and just so alone. 

I'm worried it will stay like this forever, and in the height of it I struggle to rationalize. Coping mechanisms are not my strong suit.

Hey, I am having major issues with anxiety - it is getting out of control lately due to a death in my family. I have done lots of things to manage it, i.e. food, exercise/yoga etc, but it is so bad now it is mucking up my work.
I have been to the GP twice for help and to ask for medication but refused as I scored 19 and needed 20 to ""qualify"". I have done a lot of my own reading and learning, and feel this is where I need to go.
Instead I was given a script for sleeping tablets, which the pharmacists couldn't administer for some reason, and they need to compound these after I agree to a price. ?? I don't know it seems so stupid, and to wait for 2 weeks to see if I feel better.
Anyway, how do you get help when your GP won't listen and says you don't really have a problem and just need sleep, when you really have a problem? I live in a rural area and feel like the doctors here don't think mental health is a real thing.
Its hard to ask for help, and get knocked down.

How does everyone hold down a job with chronic anxiety? I'm nervous about going back to work as I am having a massive flare and I don't know if I'll be able to cope. I'm lucky in the sense that I keep getting offered more and more hours from different people but I have to keep knocking them back as I don't think I'll be able to manage. None of the people I work for know I have chronic anxiety as I am able to keep my shit together for the hours I'm at work and maintain being bright and bubbly (I have had one person complain to me that they would never hire so and so because they suffer anxiety)  though I've had to chuck a few sickies because of it. I've never been able to maintain a steady job. I am a good worker, I always get asked to take on more and do more where ever I work but I get to this point where my anxiety is too much I start wigging out and I have to quit and the cycle begins again. I feel like I'm on a hamster wheel and I never really get any where.

Really struggling with anxiety and insomnia. My son, 18, finished year 12. Started an apprenticeship then lost his job for taking too many days off, showing up late, always on his phone. He is smoking marijuana a lot. I have a 13 year old daughter at home too. After 6 weeks of my son up all night, asleep all day, day drinking, doing nothing but live like a bit of a slob while we all worked, i told him to go find work. He packed a bag and left. He came back to the house while we were working and stole my birthday money. We had to change the locks. I have been blocked from him completely. I tried calling him once every day for 3 weeks, he just rejects my calls. Its been over a month now with not a word from him. Im a marathon runner, i work full time and im now extremely anxious and sleep deprived. Im so wired with worry of a night time. Its awful. 
any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I am wondering if I should just go back to my original dose. I really wish I was normal and did need all this pharmaceutical help. My medication is so high that my doctors will not write me scripts. I really cannot afford the psychiatrist, but my gp insists on it without any options for financing. I don‚Äôt know what to do to get out of this situation. I really want a normal life.

Hi everyone
thought i would join as I have been diagnosed with panic attacks, get some tips, advice etc from others on how they deal with stress / anxieties. Mine has come from living through the fires in January (we were surrounded), looking after my parents (mother has high anxieties whose biggest fear is fire), COVID (I work the front line in a hospital where abuse from the public is a daily occurrence ), single parenting (home schooling is not for me), and now helping my son whose father has decided to move to the UK (who visited him and said goodbye to him during the week). Like everyone it‚Äôs been a hell of a year.  Hope everyone is doing ok and managing the best they can, as that is all we can do and support each other.

Hi everyone,

I decided to reach out to this community to share some of my personal experience, and to ask for advice, I'll do my best to keep it short so a decent amount of things may be left out but I will get straight to the point.

I am a 33 year old man who has suffered all my life with anxiety and depression, my earliest memory of anxiety was 4 years old, I have done my best to do what I feel society wants from me, when I was younger I got work, did my best with friends tried my best with girlfriends, getting a car, my own place all the things that society expects. for the last 10+ years I have basically become a shut in, in 2018 I went for help, I have seen doctors, counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists, I have been on 3 different medications and about to try a 4th one.

From 2013 to 2018 I had no income whatsoever this was due to shutting down completely and not being able to leave the house at all I only had support of family. the last 2 years of my life have been extremely difficult, my mum and I live next to threating neighbours (I can't get into the details of that) and I have been unable to drive my car for the last 18 months. to spite having worked for 3 years in my early 20s and getting a car a a girlfriend or two, I assure everyone that my anxiety is extremely debilitating, while at work I suffered every day and had to eventually quit due to depression. my anxiety is all over the place, at times it's so bad I'm as timid as a shy little kid and my fear levels are off the charts. 

As I said before I am 33, I am a guy who is approaching middle age and I don't see these issues going away, since anxiety and depression has always been apart of my life, since I have tried with mental health professionals, medication etc then shouldn't my government take me serious? I have applied and been rejected for DSP 3 times so far. So far also no mental health professional seems to want to say my condition is permanent, I can't see how it's not, I am almost half way through my life.... at what point will it be considered?

So I'm here to ask...what should I do? what can I say to a mental health professional? I am tired of medication and I am tried of people trying to throw me back into work when I don't want it and can't do it.

Hi Everyone, 

I‚Äôm having a down day and I was hoping to hear some positive stories to see there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
I was diagnosed with major depression a few years ago and have been doing counselling since. Recently, I have realised I have social anxiety and how much of a profound affect on my life. I know it sounds crazy to only realise this as an adult, however, I feel like it‚Äôs sometimes difficult to distinguish between shyness and social anxiety. 
As a result of my anxiety, I find it difficult to socialise and make friends. I‚Äôve been lonely for a very long time and crave intimate relationships. The few friends I do attract, seem to enjoy me because I‚Äôm a good listener. However, when I‚Äôm done (or even up) they seem to be nowhere to be found.
I think this also translates to my romantic relationships. Men have been interested in me, however, they only seem to enjoy being cared for while not really giving much in return. As a result, I end up in relationships where I do everything (cooking, cleaning - being the sole income earner) for far too long. 
My therapist and I have talked about redirecting my caring nature to myself. I sometime think that would equate to leaving the relationships which are draining me. But it is very difficult to turn my back on the few social interactions I have. 
So, basically I wanted to put some feelers out there to get perspective on whether the types of relationship I‚Äôm experiencing are normal. Do you have friends that you feel actually care for you? Partners that do the same? Does anyone have social anxiety and went on to have successful relationships? 
Thanks a bunch. Have a good night :-)

Hi everyone, 
Lately i've been feeling a crippling sense of what I think could be social anxiety or some branch of it. For example, the other day I went back to the gym as it reopened after being closed due to COVID. I know most of the staff there and I'm an avid gym goer, so the gym environment has always been a comfortable space for me. However, I was somewhat feeling a little nervous - maybe excited nerves? Anyway, as I got there, the gym owner and club manager were there as they usually are, and there's something about them that subconsciously makes me feel a little awkward or intimidated, however usually I never let it get to me and i'm friendly enough to carry conversation well. They greeted me and then had to take my temperature due to the new COVID regulations, and my temperature was over 37 degrees! They said they couldn't let me in until I cooled down a bit, so I stood there for a while as they chatted to me (I was already uncomfortable/embarrassed at this stage). After about 5 minutes, they took my temperature again and I was even hotter than before! I felt so embarrassed and awkward, and sat there and waited another 10 minutes on my own. I couldn't understand why I was getting so heated when talking to them, when usually I don't have trouble talking to people. The next day I was at the apple store, and the security guard pulled out a thermometer to take my temperature before I entered (which I wasn't expecting), and my heart skipped a beat and started pounding faster. It triggered the memory I had had the day before about the thermometer. A few days later, when I decided I would train again at the gym, I felt anxious all morning about it. I didn't want to see those workers again, let alone have my temperature taken again. As I approached reception, I felt jittery and nervous, but luckily my temperature was under 37 degrees this time. However, the the gym owner made a comment about how it had decreased from last time (which made me feel embarrassed) and he then started talking to me about my training - I could feel myself burning up as we chatted. When I looked at myself in the bathroom mirror after our chat I noticed bright red blotches on my neck! I usually get these temporary blotches when anxiety hits my body hard. What is happening to me?? I love my gym but now I get an anxious feeling about it due to this stupid experience :( Can anyone relate/give tips?
Much appreciated <3

My name is Georgia, i am 22 and i have had debilitating anxiety for as long as i can remember, i have seen many psychologists and am currently medicated which i had upped to a higher dose.

Friday the 12th of June i moved out of the family home up in the country and down to Melbourne on my own into an apartment 
The minute my family left this crippling anxiety came over me and i could not stop crying and hyperventilating and instantly regretted my decision to move away
I dont think i gave myself enough time to fully be ready 
And i feel i just rushed into it without really considering if i was ok
As the days have gone on i have felt worse and worse and worse 
I am really not coping at all and am at the point where i cant even bring myself to go outside even to the supermarket which is not like me! At all
This friday i have made the decision for me and am moving back home to be with my family where i am comfortable and can work on my mental health with family around me rather than in my thoughts all alone in a huge city feeling miserable

Is it wrong of me to want to go home to Give myself some more time to be fully ready to move out on my own? 

Am i stupid for not forcing myself to stay here even though i have this crippling anxiety that is making me shake and sweat?

Last week my 90-year-old mother fell over onto her buttocks.  She her hand was bleeding a little bit
and she was winded but otherwise unhurt. I was upstairs at the time; I heard
the crash and came racing down to see what had happened. 

I have three sisters and I did not think Mums fall warranted a call to them to
say what had happened. A few days later one of my sisters calls Mum to ask her
how she was. When she found out she texted me saying ‚Äúshe was disappointed that
I hadn‚Äôt called her to let her know what had happened, and that I only think of
myself‚Äù.  I tried to call my sister but
she would not accept my call. I then texted her and asked her to call when she
had a chance and she responded by saying why should she. I wanted a chance to
explain my reasons why not to call, I did not think it was a big deal Mum was
not badly hurt

I texted her back saying ‚Äúat the end of the day Mum was okay‚Äù
she responded with ‚Äúyes and at the end of the day that I do not think anything
of my 3 sisters‚Äù

I did not react or respond to that. Though later on I did
burst into tears on what had happened, delayed shock I guess or the nasty words
texted to me. 

I really do not want to call my sister only again so she can have another go at
me. I did try her and call but she would not accept my call.
Right or wrong, I think I did the right for everyone. However,
I would like to know what everyone else thinks. I have had a rocky relationship
that was on the mend, it took this one thing and my sister was bringing up

 Hi all, 
Would really like some advice on how to cope with this overwhelming anxiety I am feeling right now. 
I have never been diagnosed with anxiety but believe I do have it and certain situations set my anxiety off to the point I can no longer deal with the thoughts. 
Recently, there was asbestos removal undertaken next door. I had been really concerned about this removal and on the day of the removal some how our external door (which is on the top story of our house on the same side as the asbestos removal) which I checked was locked, had blown open. 
I‚Äôm not sure how long it was open for but I fear now my kids will be harmed from this as they were indoors but in the same room where the door was opened. 
I feel like asbestos fibres could have blown into the house as it was a bit windy that day and feel they are still in the house. 
My kind keeps playing the situation over in my mind and I feel this overwhelming guilt that I have hurt my children. In checking the door was locked I must have opened it by accident. 

I feel sick to the stomach when I think about, have been waking up with panic attacks and no matter what I do I can‚Äôt feel a sense of calm. In googling conditions associated with asbestos it says they take 20-50 years to develop. 
I worry I am going to feel this worry my whole life. It is disabiling and stops me from doing simple tasks in my day to day life. Whenever I pick myself up, my mind goes straight to the situation. 
Please any advice, I am struggling to forget this and keep going with my life!

Hi. I'm a single male in my early 40s, and I feel like I've been using escaspism my whole life to create a false reality for myself, at the detriment of gaining any real world social skills. This week, I had a breakdown once I realised how impossible it all was.
I've used daydreams as a means of escape ever since I was a kid, imagining I was having conversations and adventures starting with fictional characters, then celebrities.  Lately, though, I'd started becoming obsessed with online content creators that I liked, and imagined that I was close friends with many of them. Of course, since they can now have actual conversations with us, it feels like a more ""real"" connection than ever.
I understand why I've done this - my real life has been mostly unfulfilling work, little real social interaction, and a lack of any professional skills. I kept telling myself that I would eventually pick up the slack and apply muself, but there always seemed to be some kind of reason not to.
I realised this week that there is absolutely no way of having any real connection with these people, at least not in the way I had built up in my mind, and it has DEVASTATED me.  I now can't even THINK of watching any of their stuff any more!
What's worse, is that while I was still struggling to come up with a way of reaching out to them, I tried to do something creative online, but as soon as I tried, my mind said ""What are you doing? You can't join in now! It's too late! Give up!"" And as soon as that thought popped into my mind, I instantly lost all joy in EVERYTHING creative that I used to love, like movies, games, books, music... and of course, online videos are WAY OUT.
I feel like I've wasted the majority of my life on an imaginary one. I feel foolish, selfish, creepy and more isolated than ever.  My sleep cycle has gone out the window. I'm suffering anxiety attacks, and can't focus on anything longer than 5 minutes. I have no real plans for the future now, apart from seeing a doctor next week; I'm hoping to get a referral to a professional.  I'm so scared that I'm going to spend the rest of my life in some sort of mental care facility, as this feels like my ENTIRE LIFE has been built on lies I told myself.  And my mind keeps tricking me, circling back to these obsessions with fake people without me even realising it, because I've become so used to this trick that I don't think I can make it stop...
What do I do now?!?

Not really sure if this falls under anxiety.
I've been diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety for a few years now. Seems I had the feelings long before reaching out to a doctor.
In the past 3 years, I was seeking help and felt I had slowly got better, but now I'm falling back again and it feels worse than before. My PTSD/upbringing has conditioned my brain into thinking that no matter what I do, I have to second guess myself and my brain goes into overdrive and will process every possible scenario in the most pessimistic way. I realised I lack self-worth/love and don't know where to begin this healing process. For 29 years I've been reinforced the fact that I'm not worthy or whatever I do isn't enough.
It has affected my career, social life and personal relationships.
I always avoid applying for jobs because I don't meet those expectations and requirements, it's like I have told myself I've failed before even trying. This affects my lack of income and deters me away from spending time socially.
More importantly, I realised with every relationship I get into, I always push the other person away indirectly. Due to my neediness/sensitivity and low self-esteem. I noticed I tend to get jealous easily and ask or say stupid things to get a reaction so I can validate maybe I would be worth something to someone. I don't want to be this way, it's not fair on the other person and it does my head in. It's such a toxic behaviour and I can't stand putting myself into a situation where I can feel worse or make someone else feel bad.
These issues lead me to break down randomly and random extremely negative thoughts. 
For the past few months, I have this empty feeling in my chest - where I feel like I'm surrounded by darkness and the feeling of being heartbroken - but is consistently there and does not go away. I often break down on my drives out of nowhere and cry a lot.
I tried searching online for a long time for an answer but can't seem to find anything related to how I feel our this issue of toxic behaviour cycling around and not stopping.
I need help, but don't know where to start. 
Has anyone felt this way? Understand this situation? I don't want to be toxic the person who's toxic in a relationship. 
Anyone know how I can help or where to start without it costing me an arm and a leg?
I'm desperate as it feels like everyday I'm falling further and further.

I'm not suicidal but i don't understand what the point of life is. I have been having more regular and significant intrusive thoughts lately, all along the lines of what life is about, what the point of trying is, things like that. I have also been experiencing feeling like im watching myself throughout the day, almost as if its from a third person view. I feel like i dont know what im saying, why im saying it, or even that im actually the person experiencing whats happening to me? How do i deal with this?

Hi everyone.
I'm new to these forums. After an asbestos scare that turned out to be OK a while ago, I think I have developed quite bad asbestos anxiety. I've always been a bit of a worrier in general but nothing like now and I have have never suffered from it before, unlike now. 
My current worry is this: last weekend my family and I went to a birthday party in a community hall. Many of the children who were there were playing on the floor and many adults including myself joined them, sitting on the floor. As we were leaving I noticed a pile of white powdery stuff under one of the doors right next to where we were sitting on the floor. The door was old and looked like it could be a fire door and I know that these often contain asbestos cores and if damaged asbestos fibres can be released. I tried not to think about it and tried to suppress any asbestos fears, but now, a few days later I'm just overtaken with worry. Plus I feel silly and ridiculous for worrying as clearly no one else at the party noticed or worried about it, so it's like I'm first of all worrying about the potential asbestos but also worry about feeling so silly.
I worry that, if this was asbestos, as we sat on the floor right next to that pile, we would have got asbestos fibres on our clothes. Then we sat in the car, so it might now be on our car seats, our clothes and so on. I'm trying to think rationally but my I'm just getting overcome with fear and worry. It feels paralysing. My husband thinks I'm silly and paranoid and that there's nothing to worry about. He's the type of person who very rarely or never worries about anything. I so wish I was more like that at this moment.
I've even emailed the community hall to ask if the door contains asbestos and if there's a risk it could be damaged but I haven't heard back from them. I just feel so silly and worried at the same time. I've got an appointment with my GP so will bring this anxiety up with him. 
Thanks to anyone who has read my long and probably silly post. Has anyone else had asbestos anxiety and would you have any tips on how to deal with this all?
Thank you.

Hi everyone, this is my first ever post here! 
Mental Health never crossed my mind until something happened to me 2 months ago. I‚Äôm a 25yearold Mother of one. Early February I suffered from an UNEXPECTED anxiety/panic attack. I didn‚Äôt know what was happening and neither did my family so I ended up in the ER. Tests came back all clear but left me questioning ‚Äúwhy did this Happen?‚Äù, How can this just happen out of no where?‚Äù ‚Äú what if i am really sick and they can‚Äôt seem to find it?‚Äù 
I have seen 10 doctors from 5 different Medical Centres, multiple blood tests, urine tests . 
Brain MRI, Spine MRI, Chest XRay, pelvic ultrasound, thyroid/neck ultrasound, stomach ultrasound. All clear. Found a 2cm cyst on ovary which I have had for a while. My biggest fear is cancer. My sisters husband past away last year from cancer and since then I guess it‚Äôs always been in the back of my mind. My panic attack was what triggered ‚Äúhealth anxiety‚Äù. 
 
2 Weeks ago I requested a blood test and urine just for a reassurance as that week I believed I had throat cancer. Results came back with high cortisol and inflammatory marker. Also pus in the urine. I ended up showing the results to another doctor who told me cortisol testing should be tested early morning . Did a retest and came back all normal. Except for my urine . Cloudy Urine, with pus and GROUP B STREP bacteria. 
The doctor keeps reassuring me it‚Äôs just a UTI. But I have not one single symptom of a UTI. I‚Äôve finished my antibiotics and still cloudy urine. No smell just cloudy with white particles floating around. I‚Äôm so scared. I think the worst . I‚Äôm losing sleep. Has anyone had this before ? 
From February until now I have already self diagnosed myself with 
throat cancer, spine tumor, lung cancer, colon cancer, bowel cancer, thyroid cancer, now I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs ovarian cancer or bladder cancer. I have never been like this before . I‚Äôm having lower belly cramps/pressure and lower back pressure. Not sure if it‚Äôs just me overthinking. I even have dreams about it. I already see my psych. I no longer have attacks but constant worry, obsessive thoughts, fear.

I catch the bus frequently and I do not see this driver as often as I used to (thank GOD). We connected through SnapChat and he promised not to send me pictures of his genitals. He did though, more than once. I am only using him to speak to him about a colleague of his I had feelings for. He knows I have feelings for this colleague of his and he still doesnt understand this. Just tonight he sent me a picture of the house he previously lived in. He is 55 and I am 21, and he is married. He's admitted to me that he wants to have sex with me. He claims that he will treat me with respect, and that he would give me more love and respect than the colleague I am interested in. This may be true (as I know his colleague and I strongly believe he had NPD and he has cheated on so many women) but I want nothing to do with him. He is gross and unattractive and I keep telling him this but he doesnt understand. I keep deactivating my SnapChat account to get away from him but I keep going back to him to talk about his colleague to him. I get that this is toxic and if I had an actual social life I probably wouldnt be in this mess. He is delusional and believes we are friends. He lives in a fantasy. I feel like I am being groomed, when all I was doing was using him to speak to him about the colleague I was interested in (which is a whole other story.) I'm thinking of calling the police and calling the bus dept. I need some help.

Hi there, 

Long story short... I have been suffering with Anxiety for as long as I can remember.. Im 29 years old!

Basically, Ive had the works so far..
Health Anxiety - Under Control ‚úÖ
Panic Attacks - Under Control ‚úÖ
OCD - Under Control ‚úÖ
GAD - Very much struggling, continuous üò•üö´
Social Anxiety - Has recently decided to pop up in the last few months, seems to appear when I am around someone of 'Importance' eg. BOSS? It is really bothering me, as I feel like my social skills have always been my main highlight! Im at a bit of of loss as to why this has suddenly come on and how I can overcome it? üö´üö´

I find it very bothersome that Anxiety can be one thing to start with.. only to Manifest into Multiples. When I thought I had overcome some pretty debilitating stuff.. another pops up! 

(Anxiety üñï)

Thanks for listening or any helpful advise/Input ü•∞

I don't if its anxiety or stress but I have to laugh at some of the ridiculous things I've done like booking appointments on the wrong day. In my experience anxiety causes sometimes to think too much or not enough and rush things hah I'm choosing to genuinely laugh now at my anxiety and my mood problems and kinda disorganised brain, because I've been pretty annoyed at myself of late and that's probably not helpful is it ?

So I had alot of sunflower seeds  i thought it would be a great idea to packet a few seeds
And deliver them around my community. I had about 100 packets with a little note
On each. Which took me all afternoon to do. 
I got the courage to deliver them. I only could deliver 10-15 
Due to my mind and my anxiety. Telling me I'm going to get in 
Trouble, or people will get mad at me for not delivering to their house with no junk mail on the mail box.
And just other bad thoughts. 
So now I've about 85-90 packets left over and I'm scared to do anymore. 
At one point I was going to ring my.mum to pick me up cause my thoughts were bad. And over bearing.

Hello,
I have suffered from anxiety/depression for years. I was diagnosed when I was 12 and am now 23.
I have been on medication¬†for about 4 years now. My anxiety is really up and down. Sometimes I‚Äôm really good, other times I‚Äôm really down.
lately, my anxiety has gotten bad. i have been having weird sensations and I always experience different things. I always put it down to anxiety because it goes away when I‚Äôm not thinking about it.
but lately I‚Äôve felt quite nauseous often, sometimes experience depersonalisation, dizziness and the most recent one is my legs feel really weak. It‚Äôs hard to explain, but they just don‚Äôt feel normal. Like sometimes If I‚Äôm walking I feel really sluggish/slow and sometimes feel like my legs are going to give up. It stops me from wanting to do much.
does anyone else experience this? So I‚Äôm not alone.
im going to get a full blood test soon, to check that I‚Äôm not deficient in anything either. But it just becomes debilitating and I‚Äôm struggling to put all my effort into work lately.
In terms of other health conditions, I‚Äôve only got PCOS that I know of and I saw a Neurosurgeon this year and don‚Äôt have any neurological issues that they could find.
last year I did go through a lot of trauma with DV, but it‚Äôs been a year so I‚Äôm not sure why my anxiety has gotten so bad lately like this.

someone please help

I could be exhausted and trying to sleep or after a walk,  I notice my heart is pounding but I
Don't think too much of it (I do have underlying ectopic beats and arrythmias)
Then I'd get a sudden intense horrible feeling come over me and my heart rate shoots up
Very fast, sometimes to 120 or even 180.  My breathing gets heavy and fast 
But im just lying there wanting the feeling to end, it's a horrible intense feeling in the chest
I have delt with anxiety, hyperventilating ppl many times.  Im not hyperventilating.  The breathing increases secondary to the heart rate and horrible feeling that comes over me.    I'm not an anxious person at all.  
But I've delt with this problem myself for years thinking its just a heart
Arrhythmia happening.   But no doctors know what it is.  
I'm  thinking maybe it's some underlying anxiety??  

Anyone experience the same?  I feel like I'm the only person that gets this.

Hi folks
I‚Äôve written in before and found the advice extremely useful so I thought I‚Äôd ask for more if you wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing your wisdom! 
I‚Äôm having anxiety at work in a high pressure new role (eg freezing up in meetings and struggling to present properly, anxiety leading up to meetings, trouble sleeping at night worrying about meetings!). Overall my performance is good, but its like I‚Äôm my own worst enemy and in key moments I struggle to express myself confidently! Previously I haven‚Äôt felt this way - only slight nerves. 
I‚Äôve tried lots of self help type techniques including those kindly recommended here, but it‚Äôs still really affecting me (ironically I was super depressed to learn I got promoted to this as a permanent role).
Do you think this is the kind of thing medication could help with? If so, would I go to a GP or psychologist or psychiatrist? 
I hope you‚Äôre all coping OK during this time - I would really appreciate any pointers you may have. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this

i've been living with anxiety for a few years now and have yet to find a way to manage the kind of bone-deep fatigue it brings with it. i've done my best to keep to a consistent sleep schedule and commit to exercising as i can, but nothing seems to make a dent!

I am finding it increasingly difficult to cope with work, university and living alone. How do other people cope with anxiety and depression? I am finding that mustering the motivation to do anything is hard. My job is so draining and I don't earn enough money. University lacks support.   Sometimes I can't even look after myself.

Hi, I‚Äôm new. I can‚Äôt sleep again which is a recurring thing for me these days.
I am suffering depression caused by a huge build up of external and personal issues. I‚Äôve had lots of change this last year. Moving away from family, quit my job, new town, remote, health issues, two young kids and an alcoholic spouse that has just relapsed on top of all the added stress covid has caused. I‚Äôm a health care worker in admin but still was incredibly stressed and working more then usual. Oh and we moved house and my child has had to change schools for the 3rd time and is only in Preprimary. 
I feel like I am juggling so many balls right now, I know I‚Äôm not coping. I‚Äôm not sleeping, not eating but then binge eating almost making myself sick, anxious and unmotivated. 
my spouse will not seek help, I‚Äôve tried to encourage him to contact his counsellor, I‚Äôve enlisted the help of close friends to check in because communication has broken down between us.
 I am at breaking point with no family support where we live now, only a few friends but not people I trust yet. 
I feel like the trust we have as a couple is broken because he was hiding the drinking from me again and making huge life altering decisions without me. 
I know he is sick and I don‚Äôt want to walk away but there is only so much I can take and I have to also think about our children and the damage his behaviour might cause them. 
I am trying to convince him we need couples counselling but he isn‚Äôt interested and I feel like he has just given up and doesn‚Äôt want me at all anymore. 
I feel like I offer him no value or purpose being here because the only thing I‚Äôm good for is sex and keeping the house clean, we don‚Äôt talk anymore, he confides in other people who don‚Äôt know about the drinking and they drink together. I find intimacy hard because I have physical pain from health conditions and I have zero drive now because I am so depressed. 

I know I am not perfect, I know I can stubborn and moody but I am honest with myself and how I am feeling, I don‚Äôt feel great right now but I‚Äôd tell him that I get no support at all. 
I‚Äôm am so overwhelmed I feel like I‚Äôm drowning and I don‚Äôt even have my spouse/best friend right now. I feel more isolated then ever, I‚Äôve made steps and seen my GP, have a referral for a psychiatrist and started medication. 
I just feel so hopeless, adrift and unstable in my personal life.

Hello,

I am 28 years old, married to an unimaginably wonderful man, mother to absolute perfection - twice. I work part time at a job I enjoy, have amazing in-laws and live in a beautiful home in a small town filled with kind and welcoming people. At surface level my life is perfect. 

However despite all of this, I hold a deep sadness inside. Oftentimes it never shows but when it does it can range anywhere from being down momentarily to prolonged melancholy, and seems uncontrollable. I don't know when or why or how badly it will occur. 

I have never spoken to a professional, but I believe multiple traumas from my childhood and adolescence have manifested into a deep-seated hatred for myself. I have absolutely no self-esteem. I am extremely introverted and suffer greatly from social anxiety; so much so that since moving interstate 2.5 years ago I have not made even 1 friend. My husband and his family are very well known in this town, so I have consistently met new, lovely people, but I cannot bring myself to attend social gatherings or attempt to make friends. I constantly make excuses to stay home. Just tonight I cancelled plans to celebrate our wedding anniversary, because I was too scared to go out in public and be seen. 

I am terrified that people won't like me. More than this fear though, I am terrified that I will project my insecurities onto my children and cause damage to them in some way, and I am terrified that my issues will ruin my marriage or hurt my husband. I hate being this way but I truly dont know how to change. 

I am open to any and all suggestions you may have. Thank you for reading.

I recently learnt to accept and sit with my anxiety recently instead of always fighting it. I suffer from situational anxiety of which due to the recent conditions of 2020 - my anxiety has had a field day with it. Even though I get professional help, meditate etc my friends said that they are worried for me because I am always anxious which has now got me in a head spin because I had finally accepted myself with anxiety and had decided to sit with it instead of always fighting it. But with my friends and peers always judging me in that way I am now finding it hard to accept my anxietyy, just be me, know i am not always going to be perfect and have kind of gone backwards. Has anyone else experienced this? What are some tips for going forward and accepting a life full of situational anxiety. Also getting nervous at the thought of always dealing with these painful anxiety events. Cheers

Hi all,
I am new to this forum. I guess I really want to share my feelings.
Lately for the past 2 weeks I have been feeling sad all the time without any exact reason. I was so easily irritated yesterday by little things and ended up burst out crying and couldn't calm myself down. I used to love reading a good novel and watching TV shows for leisure but recently I cannot sit still to read through the chapter or raise interest in watching the show I like. And I find cooking or even getting into shower has became an effort. It is like suddenly there is no purpose in things I do and I don't want to anything because I know I am not good at it. There are a lot of big things on my list like going on an overseas travel, moving house, planning a baby and changing my career, but I am so lost and tired and worried about not able to succeed. Especially with COVID, things have changed drastically and might not return to normal in short period of time. And I always feel like I am running out of time. I have been having bad headaches especially after work and I can sometimes feel my heart pounding very hard and pain in my chest. On some nights I lie on my bed feeling tired but I couldn't fall asleep for hours.
 I worked for retail but ever since this pandemic I was allocated to a completely different role by my company. I am grateful that I did not lose my job but at the same time I do not enjoy what I am doing and I am not good at it at all. Lately I feel dreadful having to work but I still have to make a living so I cannot just leave my job. I am also worried that my negative attitude will impact other team members and they will blame me or hate me for it. I have been working from home for the past 2 months. Occasional I would go out to buy groceries or a walk in the neighborhood. Still, being stuck in the house every single hour is suffocating and I am always anxious about the next day. 
It feels like nothing is working in my life. My provider is not able to fix my NBN for 3 weeks now. My rangehood and stovetop are having issues. My partner thinks I am always upset or angry cause of my facial expression. Customers have been yelling and swearing at me. Last Tuesday I found shattered glass bottle pieces all over my driveway. I am not angry but very sad and hopeless and tired. I don't know what to do or how to cheer myself up anymore. It took me a lot of courage to write this post to be honest, if you have any negative feedback for me please don't reply at all. Thank you

Hey, my name's Rob I am 28.. I don't know if I'm posting in the right place but I just really need help.

I just am constantly feeling like I'm so worthless and everything I do is wrong. I'm such a waste of space and I don't know what to do. I have done the things everyone tells me to do I am visiting doctors and psychiatrists and taking medication but I feel like it isn't helping and I don't know what to do anymore. It seems like when I talk to my family they care for the first few minutes and then they just expect me to be over it. 

I don't really have many friends to speak to and I'm just really really really struggling. I am not depressed specifically but I am really sad and scared all the time and I don't know what to do

I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post but I just don't know what to do.. I'm so scared and in pain all the time.

I have suffered with anxiety now for about 3 years, since then I have stopped going to social events with friends as people and public places freak me out, I struggle going to shopping centres on my own, can only drive certain distances and to certain places (my worst panic attack was while driving) which caused that..... as a hairdresser I sometimes feel anxious at work, and feeling like your going to faint, throw up ect while doing a clients hair is very embarrassing.i also freak out daily about my healt, eg; hear that someone has died of a 1 in a million illness and all of a sudden, I‚Äôm worrying I might have that illness.
all of the above is ruining my life! I have tried medication and psychologists, the medication worked for a time but I don‚Äôt want to solve my problems with a pill forever.... and the psychologist was just telling me everything I already knew about my anxiety.
my next step is to try hypnotherapy as I‚Äôll try anything that might work, so has anyone tried it or know of anyone who has successfully been hypnotised for anxiety? Or have any other treatments I can try?

Recently been feeling anxious in general all the time. Had one panic attack at night.

G'day, my name's Samuel, I'm 18 and I suffer from GAD, depression, a phobia of vomiting and panic attacks that are a direct result of said phobia. I remember  almost anytime I've experienced either myself or another person vomiting, I wouldn't go as far as saying that it has traumatised me, but these are events I cannot forget as they terrify me. I've dealt with emetophobia since my early teens and whilst my anxiety and depression are being treated, this intense fear of vomiting is causing the most damage to me emotionally. I don't go one day without my stomach acting up and instantly throwing me into fear of vomiting which in turn begins to make me feel even more sick; such as globus sensation kicking in and my stomach beginning to ""drop"" in a sense.
I feel as though, if I can destroy this phobia at it's core; my general lifestyle will improve dramatically. I'll be able to eat and drink in public or at anothers house without the fear of food poisoning. I'll be able to maintain a proper job and be reliable as I won't be scared of feeling sick.
I just would really like to know what is generally my best course of action, perhaps anyone with experience could put in a word or two, thank you!

NOTE: This post deals with sexual obsessions/compulsions. I should also say that I am a male between the ages of 25-35. 
Hi there,
I have had severe OCD for over 15 years. I have received ongoing treatment for the past 7 years in the form of medication, CBT, and ERP.
My obsessions involve anything that feels slightly wrong/incorrect/imperfect: unlucky numbers, touching something in the ""wrong"" way, checking, coincidences, surprises, repetitive body movements and tics, unwanted thoughts, contamination, etc. Anything that reinforces a lack of control or certainty. Because my triggers are so wide-ranging, they can occur any time, anywhere, and without the slightest warning. As such, I am racked with constant and extreme anxiety and fear. You will all be familiar with how distressing this feels.
My main OCD fear is around masturbation, and a fear of being ""caught in the act"". This fear has crippled me for well over a decade, and it pretty much rules my life. The ""unusual physical symptoms"" to which the title of this thread refer are the sensations I get in my body from the aforementioned triggers, which cause me to use masturbation as a compulsion, as it is the only thing that relieves those sensations. So what are those sensations? Well, as an example, a couple of nights ago I clenched my bottom in the ""wrong"" way. Immediately, my genitals started burning, and my bottom tightened. This is what happens when I get triggered. I have always referred to it as ""the burning feeling"", but it is really a mix of burning and arousal. It is absolute agony. It feels as if my genitals have been lit on fire. At its worst, it affects my ability to walk. The only way to get rid of the feeling is through masturbation (although that itself has to go ""right"", which is a whole other story). 
I have no physical problem. The burning feeling is purely an expression of anxiety, and its relationship to masturbation is magical thinking. My treatment therefore involves resisting the urge to masturbate. The cruelty of my OCD is that masturbation is my biggest fear, but also the only thing that relieves my absolutely crippling physical symptoms. I would estimate that I probably spend about half of my time in physical discomfort, much of it extreme. The other half is spent in fear. 
Has anyone else had similar experiences? It is such a difficult thing to talk about, but I am really at my wits' end. Any help would be hugely appreciated, and please feel free to ask any questions.

Hello,
I would like to start by saying that I am already seeing a psychiatrist.
 I think I have always had some issues. Never truly happy. My biggest issue is that I am always in my head - always making up false outcomes & worrying about the worst case scenarios. Anxiety.
I got with someone at a young age. We were happy. I have always been a good person, never abusive, always caring & thoughtful. We have 3 kids. After 10+ years, she left me for another man.
I was broken. For my 3 children, I immediately seeked help. I spoke to friends, I saw a therapist. I met a girl. I started to feel better.
I started to feel much better - However looking back now, I think it had a lot to do with the ""Honeymoon period"".
After sometime, I began becoming jealous. Overprotective. I was scared to be heartbroken again. Let me be clear - I don't think at any point I was a'crazy' boyfriend. I didn't yell or get angry, I didn't tell her she couldn't do things. I was needed constant reassurance. I would get in my own head, and when it got a lot, I would sit her down and explain to her how I was feeling. She was always so supportive. She 'understood' because of everything I had been through.
However it seems my issues have become to much for her, and she left me last night.
She said it wasn't me, the issue is that she has her hands full with a small child that has issues of his own, and her 'cup is almost full' already. She sent me a message afterward to say she was sorry and I am the kindest, sweetest man etc. But this just made me feel worse.
I feel trapped because I lost her because of my problems that I can't stop.
I feel as though I just want to be someone else. I hate myself. I hate who I've become.
I also have MAJOR issues with the man that my X is seeing. I can't stand it. Just any thought of him being there with the kids kills me. Is he abusing them? No. Is he a bad influence? Not that I can tell. He seems great with them.
But again, I am jealous. Life is not fair. Why should a decision by my X make me lose time with my children? Why should it mean that the man she left me for gets to spend quality time with my kids? Why should it mean he gets to have first experiences with them? That I feel low all the time? That I'm overly jealous, protective & scared?
I just feel like my mentality is ruined and I just can't do anything to help it.
I am at my wits end. Exhausted. I'm done. I'm having some really messed up thoughts at the moment. I feel so hopeless.
Please help.

Hi all, I m new to this forum community. I have been struggling quite alot with anxiety. i tend to relieve myself that this is normal and its just part of life to deal with these. But i somehow continue to get into the same situation whenever i met one of stressors. I overthink quite often, i devalue myself. I feel like I am being in a loop and i been trying to get out of it but i could not. Yesterday duing a legal phone consultation, i totally lost track of what the legal counsellor was saying i keep telling her to repeat only to find myself unable to understand. I felt bad for the lawyer and doubted myself of my competence and usefulness during and after my consultation and wondered if i was actually stupid. I self diagnose myself. I always tend to avoid situations that stresses me. I hate that part of me. I also find myself hard to connect with people and made a close relationship with them. I have social anxiety. I always seem to remember mostly the negative emotions of my life rather than the positive ones. I tried to see the psychologist and also  seem to be in avoidant behaviour. I question myself of my values. I coop myself up inside my room to play games and watch movies thinking its normal tht Im a just an introvert.I loved being like this and a part of me hates this and tells me to be more socially engaging and active. The thing is im not good in coversations and put myself in a weird position when i talk with someone. I felt awkward around people and worried the other person will see me in the same way. Then i reassure myself you are just overthking it and the other person is probably not going to see me the way i expected. This is wht my close friend and family told. But i just cant seem to change that cycle. Then sometimes i hated myself for being a person I was. This led me to think of what could be possibly wrong with me and then it jus go away when I watche movies played games or sometimes cries in front my sister. But it comes back  whenever i met with a stressor. I cant seem to find a way out of this cycle. I been trying to find a way but i feel like it is getting worse.I was wondering if anyone had faced and ovrercome issues similar to mine. Thank youüòä

Am eating ok now and get sudden hunger pains so am having smaller breakfast, lunch and dinner meals and snacking in between. Also is there any females that find a few weeks before there period that the anxiety really ramps up??

Hey guys, I was wondering if any of you have gone to see a doctor / GP about challenges you were facing mentally. If so what were your experiences talking with them like? Thinking about going in soon :)

Ive been suffering from anxiety for the last 2 years. It started after a personal training session and after I had finished my heart rate wouldn't go back down and I ended up hyperventilating in my car alone on the side of the road to the point where my hands tingled and curled up, I went all shakey, my lips tingled and I couldn't move my body properly. I feel like I almost fainted and thought I was dieing. I went to the emergency and they did an ecg and the docs freaked at my ecg. My heart was pounding out of my chest but eventually it went away. I followed up with more tests etc and my heart health is fine (I do have a family history of heart disease) and I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder . I now have been living in fear of that episode happening again for the last two years and any small triggers, negative emotions or nervousness cause my heart to go fast and my hands to go numb and tingly again within minutes and its just a big cycle of fearing these symptoms and waiting for it to happen again.   I know about hyperventilation and breathing  (health science degree) and each time an attack comes I control my breathing and slow it down and try to ground myself however I am now almost certainly convinced the exaggerated hand curling up and tingling in lips etc is not due to my breathing. I have lost work, friends and my social life because of this fear of these symptoms and can't ever be alone. I have also seen numerous doctors and psychologists even physio for my breathing and completely understand about anxiety and controlling my breathing but the symptoms keep happening and I feel like there is no way out. Has anyone else has something similar happen?  please help

Hi everyone
I have had all kinds of mental health issues ever since I was 19.  Depression, severe anxiety, panic attacks, OCD, psychosis, and I've done a lot of self medicating with alcohol at times.  My family relationships which were loving and strong in childhood have since been very up and down with lots of arguments and shouting for years and years which has only made my confidence and self esteem worse.  I have become very isolated, I get anxious in public places, I believe I look weird or act weird and people are staring at me. I always see people looking at me like I'm strange/weird.  I have really bad anxiety and confidence/assertiveness issues in the work environment.  I've tried medications and a lot of different natural medicine and lifestyle treatment.
I could go on and on, we all have our problems.  I want to share with everyone something that I have to be an amazing antidote to all of the above.  Fasting, no food or drink is an amazing treatment for my mental health and emotional issues.  It's free and good for your physical health.
You have to be sensible, don't fast to a level that is unhealthy; but say for example, fasting from sunrise to sunset just as Muslims do in the holy month of Ramadan would be a good guide. It's also worth checking with your GP if it's suitable for you.
I've found it is really healing and can help you lose weight and clear your thinking, bring about emotions you forgot you had and it's incredible for anxiety.

Hi there not sure if we are allowed to talk about this topic at all .I have anxiety panic disorder .I am medicated and i have had this since my early teenage years .I and currently seeing a gp fortnightly ,and a psychtrist 3 monthly and a mental health counciler monthly .I applied for a disability pension 2 half years ago .Based on the information i handed in it was rejected .I appealed the situation and due to lack of not knowing what to do and how to understand it it was rejected again .I then went to advocacy to act on  behalf of me because my anxiety panic disorder i find it hard to understand it all .I scored 10 out of 10 for mental health .I cant work more than 8 hours a fortnight even that is hard with my anxiety . I recently appealed again with new letters from all the following drs specialists treating me for mental health .How can it be rejected again when letters from gp psyhcitrist and counciler all state into detail im not capable .IT has caused my anxiety panic disorder to get worse and my health has really taken fall from all of this .Is there anyone else on here that has fought tooth and nail for a dsp for severe anxiety panic disorder .

Hi guys.
I‚Äôm writing today to talk about the kind of intrusive thoughts I‚Äôve been having and scared that I feel this kind of way.
About 15 days ago, I had an intrusive thought about hurting a friend of mine which set off a panic attack. Now for a few weeks I actually was annoyed with this friend over a little bit of a conflict situation but I obsessed over the incident and stayed annoyed with this person because of it. I don‚Äôt want to stay obsessed over it as it is forgetten and everyone has moved on but when I got the intrusive thought, it was accomanyed   by anger.
I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone and I don‚Äôt want to feel annoyed or angry at this person anymore as its in the past but it feels like my subconscious won‚Äôt let it go and I‚Äôm scared its sending me crazy. Yesterday I had the same intrusive thought attack because mum spoke to this friend on the phone and it caused me to have a mild panic attack. I spoke to this friend on the phone to try and reassure myself I would‚Äônt hurt her and wouldn‚Äôt get angry at her and I didn‚Äôt. 
I‚Äôm just very very scared of this feeling as I‚Äôm a good person and I want to let go of this anger and fear as I do care for this person and I don‚Äôt want to hurt her or get mad with her.
Thanks for listening.

Hi all,

As usual just looking for some comfort in the solice that I'm no alone (hopefully).

Last night my brain decided it would be fun the have dreams about every mistake I've made in my life so I could wake up anxious as possible.

I know that my day is ruined, as I I'll spend it in my head, and odds are the next few days ill enjoy an anxiety hang over, just in time for this long weekend.

Does anyone else fall off the ledge by a simple dream?

Thanks,

Hi all,
I'm not new to BB, in fact have been on here for almost 18 months now. Mostly trying to offer up support for others.
But lately, I am feeling some stress of my own. 
See, very recently I started full time work, in a job that I've been in, in a part time capacity for more than 5 years now. I haven't actually worked full time for about 14 years or more, and since this pandemic, work has been CRAZY busy. We've had a couple of people leave in the last few months, since lock-down started, one new person start, plenty of angry customers and people just being so impatient, and wanting a 'million dollar product' for the price of a carton of milk! ..... okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating slightly there, but not by much! 
Funnily enough, I've coped relatively well with the pandemic itself .... which is why I didn't post in that particular area of the Beyond Blue site ..... I mean, sure I had my tough days at first, but now I'm coping with that part of life quite well. 
I am just feeling so stressed by the end of the say that I can feel myself grinding my teeth, and swearing more and there's tension in my neck ........ yeah, I just feel quite stressed and anxious and like I just am not keeping up with the demands of the job. And the PHONE!!! Oh my goodness, the phone just won't friggin STOP!!!!!!!!!! 
What really gets my goat, is the way that so many people think they are more important than everyone else. ""Oh, but I buy from here all the time"" they say. And I think 'Yeah, and I bet you get your milk and bread from the same supermarket every week too, but THEY don't give you a discount/special treatment/free stuff just because you are supposedly loyal to them, do they?!' 
I just feel like screaming at them all and saying ""Grow the hell up! Get off your high horse and accept your place in the world! Stop acting like spoiled little brats who can't get their own way! And STOP BEING SO IMPATIENT!"" 
We're all doing the best we can with what we have. Why can't that be enough though? 
Having said all of that, most days I do actually really enjoy my job ..... most days. But some days ..... well, what else can I say? People just annoy me sometimes. And today was one of those days. 
Any suggestions on how to cope better with this new level of activity in my life? And btw, I don't want to go back to part time, if that's what you are thinking of suggesting. 
Anyway, the floor is yours ........ thanks for reading.

Hi all,
I have panic disorder along with health anxiety and IBS for quite sometime now.It has gotten worse over the last 2 years due to some difficulties.
i have been getting constant chest pain/tightness along with indigestion issues  similar to acid reflux minus heart burn feeling.
i have been to the dr‚Äôs and had a ecg.It all checked out fine and they put back down to my anxiety and gord.
I don‚Äôt believe that gord is the cause of my issue rather that the anxiety is causing the symptoms, however, often I wonder if it can be something more.
I know that chest pain is quite common with anxiety but I‚Äôm wondering if anyone is facing the symptoms that I am facing?
Tightness in the chest like trapped air in the chest and stomach area. Almost like air is going to cause me not to breathe which evening sends me to the restroom.The only thing that kind of gives me relief is massaging the area with pressure and sometimes a visit to the toilet.
Any help or any suggestions on what have worked for others would be much appreciated. 
thanks.

Just writing down my thoughts I‚Äôm hoping will help me gain some rational clarity on my anxious feelings. I‚Äôm really looking for support and positive stories! 
I have suffered from health anxiety my entire life, especially surrounding my heart. I‚Äôm 25 years old and when I was 12 I had an echocardiogram to check out my heart as I told my mum I was suffering palpitations. All was good.
On and off my entire life I have gone through stages where I feel such terrible physical feelings that I struggle to explain to anyone but I feel like I am dying. Heart flutters, big heart jumps or beats, head buzzes and feelings of being out of it, and just a sense of something wrong inside of me I can‚Äôt explain like a pain or a sensation I can‚Äôt put my finger on. 
I am going through a terrible stage now where I am convinced I have a serious heart issue and am dying. Every single day I believe I am having a heart attack or am going to pass out from a serious arrhythmia. 
I see a psychologist but have run out of mental health plan discount and struggle to see her more than monthly because of the cost. 
I have never been on medication for my anxiety and am seriously considering it now.
I faced my fear and went to the doctors the other day and organised to get a Holter moniter to check my heart once and for all. 
The issue is I can‚Äôt get in for another week and I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm going to die before next week. I am struggling every day, especially when I‚Äôm at home with time to think. The physical feelings are so overwhelming I‚Äôm ready to take myself to hospital but they always eventually pass until the next time. 
Has anyone else thought they had heart issues that they‚Äôve found out to be okay? 
How do you cope with the overwhelming feelings when everything seems so terrible?

Hi Im very new to this,
Not sure where to start but I cant seem to find who I am and how to become happy. I struggle really hard to talk about anything to anyone including mates and my girlfriend, and I'm not comfortable talking to family or a professional. I shut out emotion because its the only way I know how to deal with stuff. I know lots of people care about me but I cant figure out how to care for myself and like me for who I am. I frequently get  anxiety that Im just a joke to people and my girlfriend is cheating on me or something, Im not sure why because I know its stupid to think. I can still laugh and go out and have fun with mates but as soon as Im alone or it gets late i feel completely empty and like nothing can fix it. I have no idea what to do in life or where I am going, I feel very useless and unsuccessful in everything I do.

Hi all. It's 5am, my mind is racing and I'm in pain (literally) so here I am rambling on bb.
I haven't had much sleep in weeks. Had painful boils for a week, and now multiple toothaches. All that amid worries of covid19, unemployment, and poor health. Lost my job in March due to covid19. My wife now works 3 times a week, and will probably lose her job as well.
I can no longer afford Psychiatry so I no longer medicate, now depression, anxiety, and bad memories are feeding on my psyche. I can't afford dental care either so I'm taking pain killers by the hour everyday. The lack of sleep is making me sickly. 
I don't see any hope that my life will ever be alleviated from this state. Worst of all is I have no friends to support me. Family and friends(aquaintances) couldn't care less.

My symptoms started mid April during the Coronavirus. I was coping well in the beginning of the virus, cooking different foods every day and cleaning etc then all of a sudden, I thought is this all there is to do? Then I got diarrhea on and off for a few weeks,  then bloating, pain in my groin area, every time I breath in, then stabbing pains like electric shocks all over my body and  I mean everywhere. The latest symptom is gagging and going off my food.   I don‚Äôt want to talk to my daughter or my sister or anyone for that matter. I don‚Äôt answer my phone and then they phone my husband and tell him I am not answering my phone. Drives me nuts. I just started to get my bowels back into order and then after talking to them, I had very lose bowels after talking to them.  I am always fearful of what they are going to say to me. When people are well and normal they just seem to me to prattle on, to difficult to listen too. I know they are good intentioned. I wish I could cry or scream it might make me feel better.
I really don‚Äôt want to do anything and I just want to stay in bed or watch tv. I think one of the problems is that we are moving into a new house we have built and I do not want to participate, because every time we move I finish up hurting myself or falling over or knocking myself. I am not young but I am usually a very vital person. I used to do 3 exercise classes a week and with the Covid19 that stopped, it used to keep me sane. Now I am only packing stuff up and moving light things into the house.
I must say I have never been suicidal, I don‚Äôt drink coffee or tea, only Digest or camomile with honey. I only have the occasional sherry but at the moment, I am not drinking. I use Kombucha, water and kefir. I am getting about 6 hours sleep at night, so although it is not 8 hours, it is adequate. 
I know this will pass but at the moment I do not want to get up. The pain and stress in my stomach is less when I am laying down. I know I am going to have to face the day sooner or later.
I have seen my GP and he suggested I see a psychologist but I said I would rather see a psychiatrist. That will not happen. I will see him again next week and get a referral to see psychologist, although I don‚Äôt believe they can help me. Psychiatrist get to the bottom of the problem.
I believe writing this  has made me feel that I have a voice to say how I am feeling without negative feedback. Thank you!

Hey guys,
shout out out to everyone posting their worries and going through a shit time at the moment. In the past week I‚Äôve slept a total of 10 hours.... I lay awake most nights focusing on my breathing which feels really shallow then when I‚Äôm so tired I want to sleep I wake myself up gasping for air!! I‚Äôve had major changes in my life and routine the last three months so it absolutely makes sense to me that I‚Äôve relapsed back into anxiety! 
It is so exhausting trying to find the right help I‚Äôve tried sleeping tests, I go to a GP, I‚Äôve seen physiotherapists, I‚Äôve seen psychologists, I‚Äôve had ecg‚Äôs and heart monitors on me numerous times and everyone tells you something different. I‚Äôm feeling discouraged, I haven‚Äôt felt like this since the GP first told me it sounds like anxiety I had been so good I almost forgot I ever had it.

Hi. I don't really know how to start... I live every day pretty normal in front of everyone, but inside things feel... difficult. I don't know why. I think maybe at least some of it is anxiety, but I'm not really sure if that's an accurate explanation. I wonder about speaking to someone, but I don't know what I would tell them. I'm getting tired of feeling 'not right' so often & wonder if there is a way to feel better. I'm kind of worried if there was a 'way', what that process might look like too...

Hello all . I have experienced a lot of anxiety over the last 14 years. I have been bullied in the past which has caused varieing levels of anxiety. I work as a receptionist  at a medical centre. Had a realy bad day recently. Where all kinds of things that dont usually happen went wrong.and caused me to get high levels of anxiety and make more mistakes. Just to name a few things. The carpet got wet as the roof was leaking.the fax machine did t work.it was very busy and I was the only receptionistlooki g after four doctors who where all annoyed because the  nurse didn't come in. It all ended in one of the drs shouting at me and flinging a clip board onto the desk in front of me. I got reported to my manager by this dr as with e erything that was happening mistakes get made.My manager cant understant why I get in such a state over thease things. I dontthi k she understands anxiety. I am unsuprisingly. Thinki g of looking for another job. But just the thought of that gives me anxiety. Any kind words and encouragement would be much appreciated.many thanks. Whyte Whitch

I've been spending some time at home raising a family.
I have recognised that I don't have any desire to return to what I am qualified in. However I don't know what else to do! I have social anxiety and feel this is a big barrier to the type of roles that I would like to do. Ie I could never be a teacher, or in a role where I need to be strong, assertive and outspoken. It's just not in my nature

Hi everyone.
 I‚Äôve been battling my own personal hell for the last 6 months and I have no idea what to do anymore.
When confronted with negative events in the past I‚Äôve been able to hold on to some hope that things will get better. Lately, as my panic attacks have become more frequent and my life has been spiralling more and more out of control, I‚Äôve been struggling to find reasons to fight. 
I was harassed at work and ultimately unfairly dismissed from a full time position earlier this year so my financial security is no longer there. I‚Äôve been relying on savings to get me through and I have a new job but I can barely make myself go due to such severe anxiety, and the hours are not consistent enough for me to stop thinking about how I‚Äôll be paying for my rent, bills, etc. 
On top of this, I‚Äôm severely depressed and discussing medication options again with my GP. I‚Äôm also ready to break up with my fianc√© who I‚Äôve been with for nearly three years, and who has been the person I‚Äôve been closest to during that time. 
I‚Äôve found out that he has been speaking to another girl and eyeing off other women and it makes me furious because I believed everything he told me about me being the only one he loved and cared for intimately. 
I‚Äôve also started to rely on alcohol to escape the anxiety and associated depression, even if it‚Äôs just for a few hours. Sleeping pills are also becoming something I frequently use to get outside of my head and escape reality. 
I have people who care about me and listen but I just don‚Äôt feel like putting my issues on them because it‚Äôs not fair for them to carry some of the burden of my problems. 
I want to run away from everything and just be happy but I‚Äôm so stressed all of the time I just want to give up. 
Has anyone experienced similar? What helped you through? Because I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can deal with my anxious mind and everything else going on. 
Regards,
Rhianna

Who would have though that the internet would be right?! Everywhere I read about counting macros and using My Fitness Pal...said don't try this if you have a history of disordered eating! I thought I'd recovered pretty well from anorexia so I could ignore this advice! Turns out, a year into tracking all my food, I've turned around and realised I've walked right into a relapse.üò≠

Hi, I have come to an intimate relationship late in life and I am struggling. I suffer from anxiety and my partner doesn‚Äôt seem to understand why I am needy and require  a lot of reassurance in the relationship! We have been together for over a year but I get really anxious when I don‚Äôt hear from him for several hours.

I have always felt nervous and anxious in social situations but I always just thought it was shyness. Ever since I moved to high school (now in grade 12) my anxiety started getting a lot more serious and intense. 
A lot of my friends have started going to parties and drinking and just being teenagers. But I am unable to do this. 
The first and last party I went to was one that my friend was holding, all my friends knew i was feeling extremely anxious about going and so I thought that once I got there they would help me get through the night. As soon as I arrived the one friend who i thought would definitely stay with me and make sure i was ok, was the first one i saw and she started critising what i was wearing, I just let this wash over me because I didn‚Äôt think it was anything to be caught up on. As we started walking to the tennis court (where the party was being held) i was talking to her trying to take my mind off the situation and she started telling me to shut up and that she didn‚Äôt want to hear what I was saying.

Hi everyone, I am reaching out after reading many posts for the past 5 or so months. A quick recap on what has happened with me...
I was booked for elective surgery and began feeling short of breath, like I constantly needed to take a full satisfactory upper chest breath. The problem was I didn't always achieve it which caused panic. I cancelled the surgery and thought it would go away on its own and hid it from family and friends until it escalated into full blown panic attacks. I chop and change from believing this is all anxiety to thinking it's just hyperventilation syndrome. I've tried so much; chiropractic, iron transfusion (was low), kinesiology, naturopathy, hypnotherapy, biofeedback, butyeko breathing course (which made me feel worse). It's been 5 months and I can't do it any longer. I finally got into a good psychiatrist who has recommended some meds. I have reluctantly began taking them, but was wondering if anyone has had any success in curing this ""air hunger"" feeling with medication? I read so much where people have had this for years with no relief from medication which scares me as I feel I'm on my last resort. 
At the moment the only semi relief I get is when I try to accept it, it seems a little easier and I am now sleeping and eating better with less panicky moments. However its like a constant tape running in my head thinking/obsessing over my breathing and there is always a slight suffocation feeling happening no matter where I am or what I am doing - except for when I'm asleep. I have never had anxiety before hence my almost 'fighting' the diagnosis. Thank you so much for your time.

Heya guys decided to sign up here for some people to talk to. My brother was interested in listening to me for a while but is getting slowly annoyed when I keep saying the same stuff over and over again to him.
I was fine for most my life but the last couple of years I have been getting these weird feelings. It started when I was watching a horror movie any kind of scary scene I could feel my head getting cold like real cold..bought it up at the doctor when I went for a checkup they didnt say anything about it...ok they must of just thought I was scared so I passed it off.
Few months later and they said I had diabetes and was in danger of having a heart attack....thats when shit started to get serious. I noticed every single pain in my chest area and the worst I paid attention to it the worst it got. But if I managed to distract myself long enough the feeling goes away. Now though every single pain makes me think im gonna have a heart attack and I get that feeling of doom and terror if I let my feelings go for more than a few minutes.
Just want some advice and see if anyone else have my kind of problem

Hello all,
I‚Äôm so pleased to have found this forum. I just need to be honest to people who understand.
Even though lockdown has been okay for my family (for which I‚Äôm very grateful) my anxiety ramped up about two weeks ago, especially the physical symptoms like chest pain and racing heart, breathlessness, lumpy throat, and insomnia. Night time is the worst. It‚Äôs been awful. I‚Äôm mostly fine to get through the day (or at least ignore it) with my kids and partner and working from home, but as soon as it‚Äôs almost bedtime, it kicks into major overdrive.

The last two weeks I‚Äôve barely slept, unable to stop panicking and overthinking that the physical symptoms are something more sinister - anything from Covid to cancer. I know I need to see a doctor but get so stressed that what if they actually find something? Even though logically I know it‚Äôs unlikely, I can‚Äôt stop that panic in my brain and haven‚Äôt been able to even make an appt. Then I panic that it‚Äôs getting worse because I can‚Äôt find the courage to go. It‚Äôs a vicious circle.
I just read (and cried) through the whole thread about people‚Äôs symptoms. It was incredibly helpful to know experience the same things and has made me feel ... maybe not better but at least less panicked. I‚Äôm so sorry any of you have to feel this way.

I‚Äôve downloaded a meditation app to try tonight. I can‚Äôt go another night without sleep and I have to work tomorrow. Hopefully it helps. And my goal tomorrow is to at least book a phone consult with a doctor. 

Anyway, I just wanted to say all this to people who couldn‚Äôt see me ugly cry while I was doing it üòÅ but who would understand. Thank you and I hope you are all okay in this trying time.

Hi, I‚Äôm struggling and hoping someone can offer opinions. I‚Äòve been married for 23 years and have two children to him. I love him but....he has ocd when iT comes to house cleaning. I noticed it when we first married, but put it down to pride in his house. After having children it became progressively worse. He cleanS before work in the morning, he comes home from work And cleans again. he Has dinner and cleans for another 1.5hs min. Weekends he cleans. He so t come for an icecream with the kids and I becasue ‚Äòsomeone has to clean!‚Äô THe house is scrubbed and disinfected from top to bottom Daily . We can‚Äôt use the kitchen once cleaned. We can‚Äôt sit inthe lounge room as he will notice the cushions have been moved. Throw blankets need to be folded neatly before bed. He remakes the bed after me as it‚Äôs not neat enough. If we drop something the house (even water) it needs to be vacuumed and floors washed again. He constantly tells me I‚Äôm lazy and I live like a slob. It‚Äôs made me anxious to the point I Now clean constantly on my days off and after work so I don‚Äôt get yelled at. I fret if I or the girls drop something or if an item isOut of place. My house is like a display home. He never has time for us. He always needs to clean because according to him, I don‚Äôt clean! I don‚Äôt feel this is normal. I‚Äôve tried talking to him but it ends up in an argument as he believes his behaviour is normal and it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt clean enough. my 17 year old daughter wants to move out as she can‚Äôt handle it anymore. My 14 year old is starting to show ocd tendencies. She s become anxious too. My children won‚Äôt have friends over because of it. I could list more but I hope you get the general idea...I‚Äôm tired, mentally exhausted and struggling to continue with his controlling behaviour...
May I add, I tried talking to a few imof my family members and there repl was ‚Äòyou are so lucky he cleans, I wish I had that‚Äô. They‚Äôve no idea how controlling it is. I‚Äôm starting to resent him. Cleaning is one this but ocd cleaning is another. He is the same with MY CAR. Watches and vaccines every week. The kids and I can‚Äôt drive my car to the beach or anywhere it may get dirty or scratched. He checks it for scratches constantly and tells us off if it‚Äôs dirty inside. Dirty means sand on our shoes that has ended on the floor mats or lolly wrapper Left in the door etc.

Some excellent news for those issues with Robodebt Centrelink debts. These seem set to be refunded after Centrelink caved in under threat of a class action.
This has caused many great anxiety, led to depression and in some tragic cases suicides.
My thoughts are with you all.
Keep reaching out and supporting those affected.

Hi, I'm having a really hard time getting myself out of being isolated after this whole pandemic. I feel like everyone is still to some degree social distancing and things aren't completely back to normal but I know things have improved and a lot of people have in some ways in some ways gone back to being more social again.
I'm really struggling to do the same though. I have always had bad social anxiety and I feel this whole situation made it worse. Before the pandemic I was really trying to be more social, I had a lot of things planned and I was trying to make more time for friends. I've never been completely awful at socialising and always have friends around me but I do struggle with being the first to reach out to people. For the majority of when the pandemic was at its worst I pretty much spoke to no one. I hardly messaged or called anyone and I didn't really hear from anyone else either. I don't even know why I did this as there were times I wanted to reach out to people and didn't. There was a guy who I met at the start of the pandemic who I was dating and I pretty much spoke to everyday, but we ended up breaking things off because it got difficult and we both werent really feeling like ourselves with everything going on. After that I just became completely lonely and haven't talked to many people other than my parents and people at work.
Now I just feel like a complete mess. I feel like I've spent so much time alone these past few months I don't even know how to go back to normal. Some of my friends wanted to play games online with me today and I feel so much more anxious about it than I did before. I feel like I don't want to go out and see anyone or make plans with anyone even though we can now. I wanted to reach out to that guy I was seeing earlier to see how he's doing or to catch up but now I don't even feel motivated to do that. I just don't feel good right now and I don't see the point of seeing anyone or talking to anyone but I know at the same time I am not doing myself any good by staying so closed off from everyone. I feel like theres a lot of people out there who are probably being social and I feel so stupid for having hardly anyone around me to do the same, especially when it was really something I wanted to work on this year.
I know that there's a lot worse things going on in the world right now and my situation is definitely not the worst. But I just wish I could break myself out of feeling like this but I don't know how.

Hello everyone,
I have been suffering from some bad anxiety for the last 2-3 months now that just hasn‚Äôt settled at all. I am in the early stages of getting help with physiologist and have only had a introduction session so far. 
lately I have been feeling out of control with my emotions and just really ‚Äúmah‚Äù with everything eg, having conversations with my loved ones, getting excited about events that usually I would look forward to, Dealing with my 2 children, And just feeling like everything is just to hard so I do nothing and stay home.  Also on top of that I have been feeling anxious all of the time with racing heart. Getting tired a lot and trouble staying asleep as I wake with my heart racing and causes me to get scared and think something is majorly wrong with me so then find myself short of breath and my heart beating like crazy. I have been finding if I get up out of bed it gets 10 times worse whereas if I just lay there and don‚Äôt move at all after about half hour I start to settle some of the time but it‚Äôs Every scary.
I have lost about 5kg as with the onset of the anxiety 2-3months ago I lost my appetite so didn‚Äôt eat to great for about a week. I can eat now but if I try to have a meal the size I us to I get upset stomach and racing heart and just feel horrible. I am trying to build up to having normal sized meals but am thinking I need to just try to have small meals more frequently. Because of the waking in the middle of the night I am to scared to stay anywhere else then home because of this.
i have just got myself a horse after not riding in over 12years and am hoping I can use this a bit of therapy as when I am with the horse I find myself a lot calmer maybe because I am focused on her.
The doctor and the physiologist have both asked me do I find myself worrying about anything. I have been through a bit lately eg. my partner starting up own business, 4yo son that I have with me 24/7 so I don‚Äôt get alone time, losing my beautiful little dog I had for 2 years and was not a pretty sight, living everyone else‚Äôs lives for them and making sure they are all ok then running out of time to live my own life so after time forgetting what makes me happy or interests me. And I think maybe also worrying in the back of my mind about the whole covid-19 situation.
i guess I am just also wanting to know if anyone else has or is having these same feelings and if they have any tips I can try for when I wake at night in a panic?
can anyone relate?

A few weeks ago I decided I was going to move out of my partners parents house because I can't stand his parents. I looked at a place and liked it straight away. I'll be taking the room of another tenant who moved out. None of the move has been finalised yet and I haven't gotten the all clear from the real estate lady. The other girl who I will be living with says I should just move in my stuff already and start paying the rent so the other girl who was staying there before me doesn't have to keep paying. (There are two tenants, one moved out but still has to pay rent until a new person moves in. As I said the other tenant wants me to move in tomorrow but now I am sick with nervousness and I have been having panic attacks. My boyfriend has been distant towards me ever since I said I wanted to move out. I am worried he is going to break up with me even though I said I don't want that and that I just want my own space. So basically the fact that I could be moving out tomorrow is making it all too real and I feel sick about it. I worry that I have made the wrong decision and that my mental health will go downhill. I have a history of anxiety and depression and with big life events is usually when I become more depressed. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I am now thinking I should just stay at home with my boyfriend still because I fear I will lose him. But I am worried about disappointing the other girl because I said I would move in even though I haven't been given the all clear.

One problem at a time...
I have a problem with social anxiety. I don't know when it started, but this has been putting a halt in progress I could have been making in a lot of social situations (progress of any kind imaginable; intimately, a job I'm doing, and even just making friends) for years. I will do as much as either pretend everything's okay, or just freeze up completely with neither helping me get to the point I need to. A big effect this has had, and I'm sure a cause of it too, is that I shut myself in and haven't made friends for years and haven't learn to socialise like an adult. The only reference I have for how to act is from ten years ago, and as I am now 22 this is rather unhelpful.
",Anxiety

Overall, I feel a sense of inadequacy to everyone else, I often feel as though I am not confident enough, interesting enough, good looking enough or funny enough, I feel my life compared to others is quite boring and for the most part lonely, I feel, compared to others that I do not have a lot of friends and the friends I do have are busy most of the time which amplifies these feeling of loneliness. I feel disconnected, like I haven‚Äôt found my people, or people that get me, that know me. I can‚Äôt stand to be in my own company for too long, especially on weekends when there‚Äôs the added pressure from society to be surrounded by friends having a blast, yet here I am struggling to even organise a lunch with the 1 or 2 flakey friends I have. This makes me feel like there is something wrong me, like I am a socially inept loser, a loner. I want to belong to a group of friends that know me and love me for me, to have that feeling of family, to be invited to weekly dinners or drinks or activities etc.

I have also recently started dating someone, she is outgoing and confident and is constantly surrounded by friends of hers, her social calendar is packed ‚Äì seeing this and seeing how much she enjoys her well balanced life reiterates those feelings of inadequacy for me. I started to feel nowhere near good enough for her, like I had nothing to offer her, like my life was way too uninteresting and boring for her, like I was way too uninteresting and boring for her. 

I feel like a prisoner to my own mind, all I want is to be happy with who I am, to be confident on my own in my own skin, I don‚Äôt want to live in my head anymore, I don‚Äôt want to constantly be googling mental health symptoms late at night, I don‚Äôt want to feel irritable or restless,  I want to enjoy life, I want to enjoy meeting people and stop caring so much about what people think of me. I want to come out of my shell, find out who I am and own that uniqueness. I don‚Äôt want to be a follower anymore, I want to be me, and have my own passions and hobbies and interests. I‚Äôve thought about joining meetups and groups but I just can‚Äôt picture myself doing it alone, I don‚Äôt feel confident enough. 

I have booked in to see a professional but there is quite a wait. I‚Äôm just wondering, can anyone else relate? What were you diagnosed with or what do you think I am struggling with?

At the moment I feel really tired and exhausted from my anxiety that is now impacting my depression. 
I am also tired of having to hide it. Especially with work.

Hello! 
I'm a little anxious writing this, but I'm not sure what to do. For a long time, I know that I've had a bad tendency to compare myself to others. I keep finding myself getting triggered over others' successes and how much better they have it than I do. I then feel guilty for getting jealous that others (particularly close friends and family) have what I don't and then feel crap about myself for it. It's an ongoing cycle.

I've spoken to my psychologist about it, and she says that it's my coping mechanism and way of protecting myself, for when I was younger and my parents had compared me to others when I was a lot younger. I think it's partially true, but don't think it quite hits the nail on the head. Something tells me it's more than that, but haven't quite figured it out yet.
Either way, what I'm most concerned about is how to start reversing this. I've now become aware of it, which I'm told is the first step to getting through it. But I'm having trouble overcoming it when it happens. I just start going into a negative spin cycle of thoughts, beat myself for everything that I'm not and shut down. I've tried to catch myself before it happens or write it down in a journal but sometimes it doesn't work for me.  
Thanks for hearing me out, hopefully there's a solution to this...

I have posted a few times about my health issues which have not changed
i am now 65 and had the same problems on a regular basis for the past 4 years.  I always think I am having a heart attack everytime I get palpitations or chest pain, so I usually end up going to Hospital usually in the middle of the night.  I have had every heart test and seen cardiologist I think they think it's all in my mind as nothing shows up.
i was there last week as I has a few palpitations they did all the tests nothing.  I was really upset this time so was getting more and more agitated and crying.  Nurse said I was stressed and calm down which made me worse.
went back to GP says nothing wrong with heart, blood tests all good nothing physical wrong and to stop worrying - easier said than done.
read a few things on beyond blue about stress and anxiety.  For me it's like a vicious circle - go to bed can't sleep so get stressed then get chest pain so even more stressed, get more tests nothing wrong back to square one.
have written down how I feel and symptoms and off to GP in 2 days - what can he do for me if I am not ill physically

Hi there 
Im currently struggling with insomnia for 8 days now with only achieving 2 hrs, if I‚Äôm lucky, each night. 
My biggest issue is, I feel the sleep coming on but my anxiety kicks in and blocks that sleep from occurring. 
I feel as though I‚Äôm in a battle every night to the point I‚Äôm not functioning at all. 
I don‚Äôt like taking any medication because my anxiety goes into overdrive with any possible side effects. 
I‚Äôve been taking rescue remedy,  putting some lavender oil on, valerian, doing meditation and exercising but I‚Äôm at the point of having a complete breakdown as I feel defeated in managing this.

I'm a young girl who has recently turned 18.
I'm battling with OCD and it haunts me everyday. Washing my hands until they bleed and shutting doors repetitively have been an unhealthy habit of mine for years. I have never opened up in a format like this, but because many people here are in a similar situation, it must be the most understanding discussion space. My family is supportive of me in every aspect however, they are very tough luck oriented, so i feel i wouldn't get taken very seriously if i was to open up, or it would appear as if I'm looking for attention. My friends aren't very helpful sources to confide in because when i try to talk to them, they don't know what to say (as is to be expected because what is there to say). I have seen a psychologist in the past to discuss anxiety, yet whenever i would try to talk about OCD it was somewhat disregarded. People think the state of my hands is from the skin condition Psoriasis (which is true to a degree) but I'm scared to tell them about my compulsion. Recently having to put on hand sanitizer as i walk into school (due to the current state of the world) is miserable and it feels like acid on my hands. 
I just wanted to be comforted by understanding people because often times it feels like I'm alone in my feelings. But to end on a positive note, i couldn't have been more lucky with my friends and family because not many people have something so amazing.

Hi there,
So one thing I find makes me incredibly anxious and often makes me feels like I‚Äòm going crazy is when I see people with mental illness or talk about other mental illnesses with people. 
It generally comes from a sense of empathy towards these people. For example: yesterday I watched the episode of the ABC show ‚ÄúYou Can‚Äôt Ask That‚Äù on schizophrenia. I think this show is incredible however I spent the whole time thinking ‚ÄúI can imagine what that is like. These poor people. What if that happens to me? Are the thoughts in my head the voices these people are hearing?‚Äù... and it just spirals from there. 
I‚Äôm now in an incredibly anxious state. I guess one of my biggest fears (and that seems common with people who suffer from anxiety) is the idea that I will go crazy. 

Does anyone else deal with this? I‚Äôm scared of making myself schizophrenic or going crazy...

So it's been well over 8 weeks now of random numbness, pins and needles, heavy chest, short of breath(oxygen levels are fine) 24/7 which i went to ER for twice was perfectly fine, this has been the worst for me. I've been to so many doctor appointments, had full bloods, chest xray which was clear. I've litrally given up was perfectly fine till my daughter was 7 weeks old and had my first panic attack randomly. I'm convinced there is actually something physically wrong with me. How can anxiety stuff my breathing up? I never had breathing problems before. My doc has said you need to start antidepressant as I'm destroying my life and family's. He is refusing to do anymore testing as he believes it's all anxiety. He said 100% the antidepressants will take my symptoms away. I have been to a phychologist a month ago but my next appointment isn't till next week feeling so defeated why is this happening to meüò≠ i actually don't even care if i die anymore. Has anyone else experienced this or am i just losing the plotüòÇ

Very new to all this. About 2 months ago my life changed when I had a huge panic attack. Went to the hospital thinking I was having a heart attack, but doctors told me I‚Äôm fine. I‚Äôd honestly thought it go away with in a few days then everything came falling down on me, lost my job and thinking there is something medically wrong with me after the so called heart attack.
Fast forward to now where I only think about am I medically fine. Is always with the heart and lungs with me I‚Äôm always thinking is there something wrong with my heart even tho I‚Äôve seen a cardiologist and doctors so many times and they all the same information that I‚Äôm fine. But it‚Äôs so frustrating how I always feel like someone is squeezing my heart but I can‚Äôt do anything about it, it‚Äôs costing me jobs, being social and exercising. I‚Äôm not the fittest or a lazy person, but I do like to keep active but it‚Äôs so hard to do that now I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with my lungs. I got mis diagnosed with asthma and going to see a specialist soon to see if everything is ok but it may possibly be my mind playing games. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this story  doesn‚Äôt make much sense. But all I know is having health anxiety it‚Äôs terrible, you fear everyday. Even tho you are fine but you are living in fear.

About 2 and a half weeks ago I was fine.
Now I hardly eat or sleep, can't fully focus on anything and I will tense up for no reason. I can no longer enjoy my day to day life. It started over some completely silly worry, but now has absorbed my entire life. All I want to do now is lie in bed and feel terrible. I don't even think this is technically anxiety, as it only focuses on one issue - am I just being hysterical? Am I causing this myself? How can I go back to how I was before?  I apologize if I sound dramatic, I just feel like my life is being ruined by this.

I've always been a healthy and active guy although had started experiencing stomach issues back in mid 2018 which wouldn't resolve. I just put up with it after my GP told me I probably have IBS. It wasn't until I moved to Melbourne and had alot more free time on my hands that I saw a naturopath to 'heal my stomach'. I ended up losing 10kg and weighing in at 65kg at 177cm, so I was skinny but fit as I was running, cycling and keeping some strength in the gym. Around July of 2019 I noticed my breathing was harder when going to sleep which was pretty consistent so I scheduled an appointment with my GP and got a referral to a pulmonologist which wasn't until January 2020.
In October 2019 I noticed my right arm was smaller than my left (i'm right handed) and I had been having the sensation that it was 'slower' or harder to move than previous. I immediately googled this and went to my GP. He agreed and sent me to hospital. They brought me in and said they could notice it but there was nothing else to point to anything serious... ""1 arm (neck), arm and leg (brain)"" is what the Dr said. A few days later I woke up and could've sworn I couldn't move my toe on my right foot as well, so I went back to hospital and they admitted me. Over 5 days I underwent multiple MRIs, lumbar puncture (and a patch) and had several specialists come in and see me. The consultant neuro came in and said ""there is definitely something going on here, it's either 'congenital muscular dystrophy', 'myotonic dystrophy or ALS"". This sent me in to a tail spin as all are progressive neuro diseases and 1 is fatal in 2-3 years. I discharged myself from hospital and went to get an EMG for ALS (this is the gold standard for ALS). This came back negative and I breathed a huge sigh of relief and thought it was over.... it wasn't. I couldn't shake the anxiety and have now embarked on 6-7 months of therapy and 4 months of medication which has seen my side effects of anxiety reduce.

The residual still remaining are a perceived weakness in my right arm and leg which fluctuates. My breathing feels heavy, as though my airways are narrow. The lung function exam came back with a slight obstruction but nothing concerning the pulmonologist said.

Oh and I never actually fixed my stomach... I still get the runs (most of the time).
So now I'm in a constant state of anxiety which ebbs and flows depending on how I feel... I feel like the wiring in my brain has changed and don't know if I can change it back.

Hello 
I just wanted to jump on here and see if anyone could give me some advice. 

I live with generalised anxiety. I'm not currently on medication for it but I have been in the past. 
I am that type of person that will over think any little thing that is wrong with me and blow it up 100000 times in my head. 
For example I will have the slightest pain and somehow my brain ends up convincing me I have cancer. 

I am the queen of Dr Google which does not help this one little bit. 

Over the weekend on Saturday morning I woke up and I was feeling fine. I headed to the shops with my husband. While we were there my head gradually started to hurt like I was getting a headache. We left to go to another shopping centre. While there it was getting very painful. It was only on the left side of my head. It felt like someone was pulling a tight band on my head. When getting back into the car I started to get a tingling sensation on the right side of my face near my nose. That didn't last long but then I started to get pins and needles in my right hand/bottom half of my arm. It lasted less then 5 mins and completely went away. The headache stuck though. I went home and laid down, that wasn't helping a whole lot so I took some panadol and laid back down. Within 2-3 hours of taking that the headache was gone and I started to feel better. Now that I'm looking back on it I am terrified it had something to do with a stroke. 
It it literally driving me crazy. My anxiety has been through the roof the past 2 days because of this. I don't get anything like migraines but it does run in my mothers side of my family.  

I have made an appointment to see my doctor but I cant get in until tomorrow. I feel completely fine now like nothing even happened. 
Have I made a mistake by not reacting sooner? Is this super serious? I'm just so scared it's eating my alive inside. 

If anyone could give me their thoughts and opinions that would be greatly appreciated. 
I am aware this isn't medical advice. I just need someone to talk to until I am able to talk to my doctor tomorrow. 
 
Thanks

hi; I'm 22 year old female, just wanting some advice or even a little perspective. 
i recently entered into a relationship and we have been dating for almost 9 months. at the start I thought that all my insecurities and self esteem issues would sort itself out once I became comfortable. I'm definitely better at being more open but it's still really difficult. i have extremely low self esteem and also suffer from anxiety as well as depression. the last few years have been rather difficult for me and I was in a horrible relationship 5 years ago which has caused me a lot of emotional damage. i love my partner and I trust him but I can't allow myself to be vulnerable. i feel physically sick if he compliments me. i don't feel comfortable to be naked around him unless it's dark. sometimes just him looking at me in the eyes makes me uncomfortable. i dont know how to allow myself to let him love me. I feel so down and have spent the better part of the last 12 years hating myself. its really difficult to change my way of thought when it's all I've conditioned myself to believe. i feel that as much as I love him, I'm always keeping him at arms length; and its not fair. he has raised his concerns around me not feeling comfortable and I worry thst if I csnt work through it, this isn't a very stable foundation for a relationship. i just don't understand how to get over it. it makes me so upset that I'm so psychologically messed up that I'm going to lose the best thing that's ever happened to me. 
the other part of my brain feels like maybe i should break up with him because it's not fair for anyone. I'm not.being the best version of myself and he deserves to have all of me. not just the parts that I'm.willing to share. i just don't know if im ready, if I cant learn to be vulnerable with someone who loves me unconditionally, i dont think I ever will. I've expressed how I feel; and he listens and understands; but it's frustrating for both of us. i feel I should be taking the time to work on myself. but I love him more then life. I'm so conflicted. 
I'm feeling really broken and confused.

Last year i became depressed and quit my job, i started a new job shortly after but quit within a week due to anxiety. I got better in a couple of months and found a good full time job again. I've been in this job for almost 6 months but in the last fortnight have become overwhelmed with anxiety. I started back on anti depressants and I already have different anti-anxiety meds. My anxiety is the worst in the morning, its almost debilitating and its stopped me from going to work for a week now. I have been honest with my manager and they are very supportive but i still feel so scared to go into work but i dont know why. Feel like i'm going crazy.

Hi Everyone,
I'm back again after 5 years. :( I have (I hope) IBS again, BIG TIME. Loss of appetite, acid reflux, stomach cramps, diarrhea and with that a whole lot of anxiety. I'm convinced, as many others who suffer health anxiety, I have cancer. This has been going on for 2 months now and I'm so tired of myself!
It was probably brought on by being a touch overweight (started at 69kg - now 65kg) 155cm, drinking too much wine, and eating too much good food (big meals, ending with red wine & chocolate!). I have been on heartburn medication for 2 weeks, fixed the acid reflux and am taking a probiotic, BUT the stomach cramps and diarrhea are still continuing. Dr Google says anything from cancer to IBS. Which one do I choose... yep cancer. That spins me into a full blown panic and anxiety situation. Hot sweats and flashes (I have enough of those at 56 years due to Meno) and the shakes...
I was having one or two glasses of wine and smaller meals, but as of today (more bouts of severe diarrhea I think from taking Mylanta) I'm cutting out all alcohol and acidic food, limiting to just chicken, fish, rice, potato, avocado, herbal tea and the odd cup of tea with manuka honey. I'll let you know how I go... No drugs, except for my probiotic in the morning.
I have been in touch with my Doctor who has done all the tests. The Bowel screening test results yet to come back and am seeing a Gastro Specialist in 10 days. Those 10 days are going to be interesting to say the least.
My question to the forum is how do you cope with catastrophising? Does anyone else have this problem with IBS.

I know no-one except a Specialist can tell me what it is, but I hate this feeling and I hate me for feeling like this. I just want to sleep for the next 10 days so I don't have to think about what if or what is to come...

I have ""own occupation"" income insurance and have been on claim since 2016 for a depressive disorder and on-going anxiety, that is chronic when I'm under stress.  
My Psychiatrist has consistently said I cannot yet return to my pre-disability role and my Psychologist has said I should NEVER return to that role due to the stress levels involved.
It was however suggested to me that it may be helpful for me to return to some sort of part time work that was relatively stress free to get some routine back into my life. 
My employer has been very supportive and created a new 'stress free' role for me for 10 hours per week.  This is a much ""lesser"" role than my pre-disability role and not a role I ever wanted to do on a full time basis, it was just intended to get me out of the house and back into some sort of normal life.
My insurer is now pushing me to take this new role on for more days/hours, which I do not wish to do.  Nobody wants to take a massive down step in their career.
I was sold 'own occupation' insurance on the basis that if I couldn't perform my pre-disability role, I wouldn't have to work at all if I wasn't able to perform the duties of my previous role. Now the insurers are trying to tell me, and I quote:
""Your Income Protection is essentially own occupation cover as you are protecting your income in the event that you can't perform the duties of that occupation. No matter what occupation you return to when you are medically able, you will always earn income as though you are performing your original occupation. There are no Income Protection policies that will continue to pay full benefits if you are medically capable of returning to work.""
My interpretation of this, is that if a surgeon could not perform surgery anymore, but could work in a gas station, that he would be forced to work five days a week in a gas station. He would be paid by the insurance company for the difference between his role as a surgeon versus his role as a gas station attendant, but how depressing to go from one role to the other.
I have contacted a solicitor and he believes I can't be forced into 'any' occupation if I cannot perform my 'pre-disability' occupation.  But I see a legal battle coming.
I don't want to be forced into a menial job on a full time basis, when I was sold 'own occupation' insurance (at a much higher premium) on the assurance that if I couldn't perform my pre-disability role I wouldn't be forced to take on a lesser job.
Anyone been through this?

Hi,  thank you for taking the time to read this post. 2 years I've been suffering Anxiety.
I thought it was an excuse,  something ppl made up. How wrong and nieve I was.

I'm bloody over feeling like I can't get out the door and always late.

Gday, I have recently had a pretty awful anxiety experience which made me finally get some help. My GP Has put me on a low dose of a medication¬†to deal while I get therapy sorted out. It has been working alright keeping the edge off, four days ago I went back and he has put me on a higher dose. The next day all my original symptoms feel like they have came back and I feel terrible. Has anyone else had this issue? Thanks in advance

Hey there,
so for a little while I have felt like I have been getting increasingly more anxious and I‚Äôm not sure if depressed is the word. But I feel lonely and kinda of feel like fading out. I have no motivation any more really. Which is really annoying when it comes to exams. I also had an assessment where I had to present earlier this year and I usually get nervous. But this time I felt like I was going to cry and I could feel my whole body siezing up. I know there‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of and I usually just feel a little jittery before. But as soon as I talk. It just takes over. And this has continued to happen for the rest. I want to get help but I‚Äôm afraid and I feel like I wouldn‚Äôt be able to explain myself properly or wouldn‚Äôt want to admit to myself how I‚Äôm feeling. Mental illness also runs in the family. So it makes sense that I could have something but I feel stupid to say I do. Hope this all makes sense. :)

Hi, 
During April I was stood down from my job as a training co-ordinator due to the lockdown we weren't getting any new employees and with staff being stood down there was no requests for training. I have two managers my direct manager was also stood down however my manager who is our team leader was not I haven't heard from him in 4 weeks. Except when he cced me in on an email to the girl who used to do my job that she was to take over one of my admin jobs. I understand why he asked her cause she knows how to do the task but it sucks cause I spent months trying to get out of her shadow and to be stopped called her number two :/ 

Lockdown is slowly being eased and my work announced that some jobs will be stood back up and some won't. I have a feeling my job won't be stood back up and I'm worried I could actually be made redundant.

I'm not sure if I should start looking for a new job or try to wait it out a bit longer. As great as it is being home I have this need to be needed. So not being in a position to be useful is getting me down.

Hi, 
Ive never done this before so its a little weird not having a direct person to chat with but Im guna give it a go anyway. Ive recently experienced a death in my family, its the first one that Ive gone through. Im not entirely sure where to go from here, its the major factor of my anxiety- which now stops me from doing things that I normally would. My anxiety has me constantly terrified that every ache and pain is a serious health issue (stems from the death of my family memeber) and just feel scared to do anything. Ive pulled myself out of situations that cause my anxiety and all I can put it down to is when Im alone in my own head and just thinking to much. Ive always been social so this is really strange not wanting to go hang out with my mates.

Hi, 
Wanted to voice and get some help on my health anxiety. I had a period in my life, during my teens where I was the most stress and anxious free, but in my childhood and in my early adulthood now, my health anxiety has started to creep back in. 
I have just started my MHCP and saw a psychologist for the first time the other day, since I was 9/10. 
My health anxieties were very small the big with over the last year, with little stresses here and there, but in the last 3 months I feel it has become an all consuming and exhausting thing! 
The main thing I am worried about is Asbestos. I know it was banned a while ago now, but to my knowledge there are still fences and homes that still may contain it. 
My uncle moved to a new home and low and behold his fences were asbestos. My cousins were playing outside and the soccer ball was hitting the fence at times and made me think to an obsessive amount that fibres could've made it onto the ball/my cousins clothes etc and then transferred to my car and then to my house and all my belongings etc. There was no physical damage or breakage of the fence, but it still concerns me to this day. 
I am so aware of the effects it could have, that I am now hyper aware of where asbestos could be in the environment?? I.e could it be in my families house roof( we recently moved to a new house) My stepdad cleaned the gutters the other day and had to climb on the roof and over the cement tiling and I am worried that Maybe something has broken or cracked or something and that his clothes and any items that he had with him and what he touches in the house may affect me. 
It already seems to be affecting me as I don't want to using the washing machine and I worried to walk bare foot in the house or sit on the couch, and constantly washing my skin. 
I feel so embarrassed to want to ask and get reassured that it isn‚Äôt asbestos, but worried I will be judged for what seems to be to be silly worries. 
There are two family members with cancer and the last thing I want is to be sick. 
I am also concerned about EMF and the introduction to 5G and the potential health concerns there. I am also turning my phone to airplane mode all the time.. but as I am in a family home, I sleep close to the modem :(
what advice does everyone have? :) Thank you in advance!! 
sorry for the long rant hahaha.

Hi all,

Has anyone had any experience with ‚ÄúThe Resilience Project?‚Äù Whether as a professional, teacher, parent student or another interested person?
I would love to hear some feedback on whether this helps with anxiety.

Hi

So I have been dealing with anxiety and depression since I can remember. It started out with obsessing over how I looked and acted due to bullying, then progressed into workplace anxiety, general anxiety and social anxiety as I got older. I am 24 now. 

I am unsure what to do, I don't have the financial ability to see a psychologist, and I know from past experience therapists don't help. 

So the gist of it is that on meds or off meds, about every 3-6 months I have a breakdown. It's like all the anger and anxiety and stress accumulates until I can't handle it anymore. The stress/anxiety comes from over thinking everything. 

I have a lot of techniques to deal with it all. Over the past 6 months I have incorporated exercise and a healthier diet to help improve my mental health, but then I started to stress and obsess over that too. Thoughts like; I'm eating too much, I'm not eating enough, I had too many biscuits, I didn't run or walk far enough. I ran or walked too far, I'm going to get fat like my mum, I can't accept food that has been bought for me.

Also note that I have quit smoking over this period too. 

I'm not sure why but it's either I'm stressing over everything and get angry at everyone and every single noise, or I'm having a peaceful day. (The peaceful days are very rare). 

There is no inbetween. 
I feel stuck. I can't get hell from family because they can't afford to help, but the government won't help me because I'm not defined as someone who needs help. 
I am on Job seeker at the current moment, but they will eventually push me i nto a job and the cycle will start again. 

I just want to get better, and not have to turn back to medication. But there is no help for me.

Recently started a new job and am filled with self doubt and anxiety. I am starting to recognise that I suffered this at times in my last job too, and lately I have been waking up through the night with feelings of panic, wondering if I have done everything right and doubting whether  I have what it takes. I have always been an overthinker and procrastinator. I am getting sick of hearing myself constantly voicing the same self doubts and anxieties and think maybe its time to actually do something about it to help overcome this. 
Does anyone have any pointers or services to recommend? 
Thanks in advance.

Hello everyone,
i found out about this forum accidentally and i want to talk about somethings i have always held back. 
I am 21 years old and i don't  know what's wrong with me. I moved to Australia almost four years ago when i turned 18. After i finished High School, my parents thought it was better for me if i move 9000+ miles away from home and start a new, better life. I was excited about all the new ventures but i was scared my anxiety would get worse. I lived very basic life back home, my parents raised me well i think and gave me a perfect childhood any kid could could ask for. The kind of society i lived in is how i developed my anxiety, i was always told i was never enough and there were standards for girls and boys that just had to be met. 
I have always been that innocent, quiet, shy girl at the back of the class. No one really ever talked to me and i don't really have a good amount of friends. I know it's not about having a lot of friends but about having a few good ones but i don't even think i have a few good ones. Over the years, I have held back too many of my emotions, i always thought i was overreacting when i felt overwhelmed during different situations and that what i was going through was all normal. I was somehow taught that i had to keep quiet if i were to lead a NORMAL life and I knew that i was never going to be an IMPORTANT person and that my emotions could never mean anything to anyone and that was alright with me until i started to breakdown every night, every afternoon, and wake up with this heavy, tired feeling. I have no one to talk to because i feel like i'm asking for too much and that i am creating all this anxiety i have. I have developed a traumatic social anxiety that refrains me from being able to talk to people or a small group,  i feel i am a burden to all the people around me and my parents as well. Don't get me wrong, i have done nothing to hurt the people around me but i feel like my presence is never appreciated so i tend to be by myself, contained in the four walls of my room.  
I cant really seem to be able to put into words what i am going through but i hope it was understandable at least. I really want to change myself because i have a whole life to live and i can't lead a happy life this way. I want to improve my flaws and live the best possible life i can but i need a little guidance, what would you suggest i do first?
xoxo

Hi everyone,
just need a moment to vent to people who understand how I feel, I‚Äôm so over my anxiety everyday I have an anxiety attack over the way my body feels, not being able to find something example if I can‚Äôt find my phone, feeling like I have failed my children, I cry all the time. I feel tired all the time, I‚Äôm constantly worrying if I‚Äôm going to die, my anxiety is health related and I‚Äôve never been like this! In the past 2 months After having my baby I‚Äôve had constant headaches, ear infection, really bad vertigo, bad sinus infection and pinched nerve in my shoulder and Burtist in my shoulder, I was on medication and It didn‚Äôt work for me at all it gave me nightmares, made me feel numb and not myself, so I stopped that real fast was convinced I didn‚Äôt need medication to help but it‚Äôs getting worse and paying $160 to speak with someone to help this isn‚Äôt helping, it‚Äôs just taking money I don‚Äôt have! 
im constantly calling my husband home because I‚Äôm scared something bad will happen when he is at work! He is currently on the verge of losing his job because of me he tells me my heath is more important, but I can see it‚Äôs starting to drain him also! 
im just trying to see what my next step is and if I should give medication another go, I‚Äôm tired and I need to feel myself again!
 
any advice would be great thank you üòä

In the last 6 months I have experienced a significant amount of trauma with illness and death of a sibling (the second I have lost way too young).  During her illness (and other life stressors along the way) I developed GAD and Health anxiety.  I was fixated on my own mortality and every body niggle or pain lead me to catastrophising about my health.  I was convinced a heart attack would happen at any moment or I had some illness that would end me soon.  I could not function in every day life activity - showering, toileting, cooking, driving, relaxing, exercising - everything caused a significant amount of stress and anxiety - I couldn't even walk to the letterbox without my phone in case something bad happened.  I was dealing with a level of anxiety I could never have imagined.  The physical symptoms were debilitating.  Chest pain, racing heart, a pulse so strong I thought my heart would burst, headaches, pins and needles, aches everywhere in my body and on and on - I ticked every item on the symptoms list I am sure.  
But I got help.  I did some online CBT and started seeing a psych.  I worked extremely hard to help myself feel better and most importantly safe.  And it started to work.  The ruminating thoughts have nearly vanished, I can do things again like take a shower for longer than 2 minutes.  The physical side has calmed down tremendously and I know I am on my way to recovery.
 
But - and here's the clincher.  It's hard to remember just how bad I felt (I liken to when women say they forget about the pain of childbirth because what they got from it is so much better)  But forgetting means when I get those anxious days and the heart palpitations pop up or the muscles ache or the tears flow for a while, it brings back the anxiety I had nearly forgotten I had.  It's very weird, I know it's way less than it was but it still feels incredibly hard.  Using my journal I can usually take my self back and reassure myself that I am better (not cured) and that gives me the strength to move forward.  But sometimes this doesn't work.  I am curious to know how recovery set backs work for others?

I was anxious as a kid but it was normal anxiety, it had hardly no impact on my life.  I remember being really nervous about having to do a speech in front of the class in year 11 and I was really worried and anxious about it the afternoon/night before.  I've lived with an anxiety disorder for quite a few years now and just going to work everyday for many years was worse then how I felt performing the speech.  Just going to the shops or catching public transport brought out my anxiety pretty badly.  Study, socialising, work, family gatherings all cause me anxiety sometimes to the point in which I've had to not show up many times.
I feel like there's hope though and I'm getting better at managing through self care.  
I've been wondering how it all started and why I have been like this and I think it's because of my own actions or decisions, may sound strange.  Or is anxiety something that happens to us? or is it a bit of both?

Hello everyone
Yeah me again. ¬†
This isn't the first time someone has mentioned that I may have an¬†eating disorder' but since realising that I was in denial over PTSD very recently, I reckon I have been in denial over this too. Sigghhhh‚Ä¶ at this point I'm like 'throw it on the pile' and I'll tell my MH support people. 
I'm pretty sure I know the origins, childhood. When there was barely any food for many years. Luckily we moved to an old neighbourhood, to live in a shed mind you, where there were lots of old fruit trees. I learnt how to climb the trees, open the fruit like a pro and after taking out any larvae in it, eat the fruit. Not to scare my little brothers, I would make out this was fun but I was always scared there wouldn't ""be enough"" for them. I fed them first and would often be out till after dark still starving and shaking. 
It morphed into back to back dieting and forever restricting food. Then overeating then back again. 
As an adult I went to overeaters anonymous for years. I'm not sure if this helped at all but I learnt some things. 
My mother always grew food and I do the same. Probably compulsively through many hard years. 
I had to get food from church food pantries to feed my family over many years as I dealt with back to back Courts, paying for legals was a nightmare. I was always worried that there wouldn't be enough food for the children. I cooked the same foods in as many ways as I could, so the children would be less sad and hope they wouldn't feel deprived. Basically now I seldom feel hungry but don't eat as much as I know others do ie my children. 
How did you help yourself with an eating disorder? 
Was there any specific therapy that helped? 
Thankyou for any feedback in advance.

Hi all,
I am Harper and I am 15. I have read through a few of the threads before I decided to introduce myself. I have anxiety and I am a huge over-thinker I remember always doing it when I was young, I think about everything that could possibly be an outcome of what I say before I say it. sometimes this seems good but it means that I talk a lot less then other people because I spend a lot of time going through everything. I am socially awkward I guess you would say, I am pretty sure I suffer from 3 different types of anxiety although I haven't had a diagnosis because i am to scared to tell my family. I have generalised anxiety, social anxiety and specific phobia. The specific phobia i have is called Misophonia which really means that I can't deal with certain sounds, especially the sound of people eating/chewing. It's not like i just don't like the sound, I cannot stand the sound and there have been times when hearing the sound as mad me burst out into tears. this isn't a recognised disorder in the DSM-IV or anything so not many people know about it. I hope that there are some people out there that either also have this or know about it so I don't feel so alone about it. 
I am sorry for just word vomiting, I hope it all makes sense.
I am also sorry if anything isn't actually correct, this is just my understanding of it and my experiences.
I am glad i am on the forum now so i can talk to people about this and hear other peoples stories too, it seems like such a lovely community.

Hi,
My 8 yr old daughter is all of a sudden  scared all the time and gets easily  upset, she starts crying but doesn't  know why she  crying.
She has been home from school  with me for the last 6 weeks as i lost my job due to the covid 19 and a week ago I started back at work 3 days a week so she goes to school for 2 days. School is obviously  very different from  before covid 19 I  have to drop her off and pick her up from front of school, I'm not  allowed to  walk her to class she is in a different  classroom with different  teachers and different  kids.
Over the last couple of days she has been more tired, very emotional, she won't  go to bed by herself and then she just cries. When I  ask why she is upset she says she doesn't know  why and that's  she scared but she  doesn't know what  she's  scared about. She has started hoping into bed with my husband and me in the middle of the  night which she has never done. 
I'm not  really sure what to do.

I'm a teacher and have immuno compromised family members I am sole carer for. I have been back at work for a little while but I cannot resolve the issue of different rules in school vs social distancing in the outside world. I have had a couple of massive panic/ anxiety attacks in the past two days.
I walk around with 1700 others all day in a world where social distancing is talked about but impossible to maintain. I don't believe children (esp 18 year olds) are affected as differently to adults. I'm the teacher so I can control this to some extent but how can my 14 year old, who returned to school today do this? - he cannot control others - he's a teenager - they cannot be expected to socially distance. How can I let my child back into the system I am rendered unable to cope with?
I have spoken to a few people who try to tell me how lucky we are and how its theoretically safe but my brain has put up walls that I am petrified to knock down.
My GP says its all a myth - so I can't exactly ask for help there. 
After isolating for two months I am finding the lack of control of environment incredibly difficult to deal with. I'm walking daily but as soon as I try to chill a bit my head floods with arguments about the valid and non valid aspects of what I'm experiencing. 
I know a lot of school children are experiencing the same anxiety that they've never had before - any advice on how to move forward would be welcomed. Big socially distant hugs to anyone experiencing the same - I'm sure we can get through this but I'm just not sure how.

Hi I thought it would be a good idea to chat this out. I know i have anxiety not been to gp just try to deal with it as it happens but my anxiety has flared up bigtime due to having to finally get council help about my neighbours dog, I hate confrontation so tried to avoid this but yeah finally had enough (2 years) apologies trying to not talk about that too much, the big issue is now I am too scared to move around in my house, go outside, I know i have done nothing wrong but I feel like I have, I feel so much self doubt about anything i do it got to the point that i felt that i have now put my family in a war zone and the only way to stop bad stuff happening to them would be me leaving them.  I suppose I am wondering if there is something bad coming off me that is going to make bad stuff happen to all of us??

Hi everyone,

Long time between drinks, but just looking for a shoulder to lean on I guess.

Today's story: I overtook a car in a 100 zone, my speedo said he was doing 90. Anyway he touted at me and I could see in the rear view he was yelling at me. As we came up to a T intersection he was still going and I honestly had no idea what the issue was so when he pulled up beside me I lowered my window (not sure why) nd he proceed to yell at me.for over taking him when he was doing 100 and over taking on unbroken lines (the definitely were, they were unbroken for on coming traffic as we were going down hill).

I kinda just disagreed and he yelled some more then we went our own ways.

Long story short: I know feel really anxious about the possibility that I did do something wrong.

I'm well aware that worst case my speedo is wrong and he was doing 100 and I over took by speeding, but nothing happened and life goes on.

My issue is something like that instantly puts me in a spiral of what its and ends with me feeling like I need to do something dramatic (like sell the car).

Does anyone else have an issue like this and bonus points if you have a trick to stop that spiral?

Thanks,

Hi, I'm new to this site but i thought i'd reach out to see if anyone feels the same/has any advice. I'm 16, and i've been struggling with social anxiety for about 4 years now. Every social situation, no matter if it is with people i consider my closest friends/distant family seems to trigger me and send me spiralling into anxiety. e.g. tonight we have some of our cousins over (one of them a boy my age) and my chest has felt tight, worries have consumed me for the last two days and i just cant seem to focus on anything else. i don't want my symptoms to control my every action. when i go on forums like this most people talk about their anxiety when they meet new people- wondering if there's anyone out there who gets extremely triggered by social situations w/ friends or family?

In 2019 I was hospitalised with severe anxiety after I
was severely micromanaged and bullied by an manager placed in charge of my team. 

This bullying includes thing such as:
Putting pressure on to
do tasks that do not align with organisation policies
Constant pressure to
give access to systems this manager is not meant to access
Derogatory and incorrect
comments in relation to work performance
Not correctly reflecting
the great work the team do to senior staff of the organisation. 
Constant pressure to do
work not within our roles 

At that time this manager was to move into my office at the
worksite. The boss of the organization then removed this person as our manager. 

The same Boss has now indicated she
would like to move this same person back into our office again. 

Is there any laws/systems in place as to when a person with
a known Mental Health disorder to prevent such bullying happening again and the
same result of hospitalization?
The organization has many other managers that can manage our team, and we have not had this problem with other managers.

After abuse at a NSW infants school when 5-6 years of age, I developed
anxiety. My condition led me to leave Australia. I last saw my wonderful Mum in 2004. We telephoned often and I was
lucky we had a great chat on Mother‚Äôs Day last year, just before she died on my
birthday a few days later. The care home where Mum was said they could organise
skype for us but never did. Nor did I get information as to what caused Mum‚Äôs sudden
shock deterioration. 
Now I have
to sign probate documents but I have
explained several times to my solicitor, that I cannot touch anything from Australia,
especially from where I grew up.
As I wrote:
‚ÄòThank you for your email with the probate documents. 
Sorry again
for my anxiety disorder being a problem, but the mere suggestion of receiving
physical mail from Australia sent me into another panic attack last week. Hence
the delay in replying. 
Even if it
means more time and probably cost, can I print the documents out here and have
my signature witnessed and then send them back to you?
Just
getting a notary to help will be a challenge, as again, my need to feel 'safe' away
from Australia means I don't want HDC being able to see the contact details of
the legal office I usually use. 
The
Australian Embassy here has absolutely no interest in helping me, so I will
need time to find a notary. 
I hope you
can understand my situation, even if it sounds completely crazy.‚Äô
Then I received
the following e-mail.
'Unfortunately
you are required to have the copies of the death certificate and will
certified, which requires that whoever certifies these documents see the
originals. This means that we will need to post the original will and death
certificate, and it is not possible to simply provide soft copies as
I had originally thought. Unfortunately I do not see a way around this
requirement. I understand your reluctance to provide an address, but perhaps
the documents can be sent to someone you know and trust?'
So again,
my problem is not understood.
Isn‚Äôt there
a way for someone I elect as a power of attorney to sign the
documents for me? I may not be physically incapacitated but mentally I am. I have
finally made it back to being able to work, though my crazy routine at my
apartment door saw me terrorised my the woman opposite, who photographed and reported
me and so the police were involved. With corona, I lost my job but if I can
just get this issue of signing these documents dealt with, I can really move on
with my life again.
Thank you.

I have posted in the Family issues section before and received a lot of support which was very appreciated. My problem now is my DIL who my son in separated from has filed a protection order on me where I temporarily can't see my  two Grandsons. I attended Court a couple of days ago and i am fighting the charges with a very good Solicitor. I have lodged my Afadavit and my Solicitor is confident that I will come out on top as it is in his words to the Judge 'a vixacous and malicous attempt to get even with my son through me "" The hearing isn't until the 29th of April and I just feel miserable all the time.  All I want to do is sleep and hope when I wake up everything will be different.  How do I pull myself out of this  blue funk I'm in. I can't get in to see a Psychologist until 17 March.

Does anyone feel their depression worsening because they are not afraid of the virus and don't agree with the lock down?  I can't stand the isolation and hate the restrictions on my freedoms.  I was isolated before this started and now it's worse.  I feel that the isolation will actually kill me if it goes on for much longer and I am spiralling downwards.  This is made worse by the fact that the reasons for the lock down are no longer in existence.  I know that on 1 June things will get better, but it seems like a lifetime away just now.  Isolation is used as a form of torture in some countries and solitary confinement is a punishment.  I feel that this is being imposed on me, even though I haven't committed any crime.  Some people cope better than others with these sorts of conditions.  You tube videos, baking cakes, and knowing that flowers will eventually bloom doesn't make any difference.  It would be nice to know if there are others who feel the same way.  If anyone else out there thinks the same, please post a response.

Hi, I haven't been here for a while, I used to be part of the forums struggling with Depression and anxiety, well I'm back. I am terrified of my latest diagnosis of a large cancerous tumor in my bowel which needs to be removed in the next few weeks after delays due to just how busy the hospitals are. I'm scared, I'm anxious, I'm sad, I can't think straight, I'm in pain at times but have strong medication. I have addictions I need to stop pretty much asap! I pray, I cry, I shake and deeply hurt by hurting others by my diagnosis. I think of chemo all the time, the operation, my life. I'm not coping. I haven't told my father and don't know how to, his old and already lost his wife his brother, 2 sons and grandson in the past ten years. I know you can't do anything about any of this but if just one person could pray for me I would be grateful. I'm sad by what this virus has done to the world, the heartache it has caused for so many people, the personal stories I hear, the depression lockdown is causing. I try make the most of the times I feel okay, both physically and mentally but I just fall to pieces sometimes. I'm trying to be strong and pray the lord will give me the strength I need. I'm not brave, nor do I think I deserve the love I get sometimes for some reason, but please look after each other and help each other, please do something kind for someone because it makes so much of a difference in someone's life. We are all in this together. Thank you for listening. Xxx

Admittedly, there's so much for me to hate here and its even worse when I can't leave for a long time due to being so dependent on my parents.. I'm 22, but I'm not very functional and I very rarely work since I'm in a job with my step-dad who I don't get along with well at times (same with my mum). I'm also somewhat autistic (""highly"" functioning) and that anxiety and depression (non-suicidal) affect me, but my main issue is that I want almost nothing to do with nearly anything Australian due to how much I hate this place and most of them for complying with a subjectively bad system.

But yeah, what I hate about this country and its culture is its authoritarianism (gun laws; coronavirus regulation, beaucracies everywhere, signs warning fines punishment everywhere, so many victimless crimes etc), being treated like convicts, anti-intellectualism, tall-poppy syndrome, entitlement, and almost all Australians happily complying to their masters regardless..

Here's an example for authoritarianism, a Tasmanian was seriously arrested for camping out in the middle of nowhere for one night during national Coronavirus lockdowns.. This is how bossy our society is, that would not happen in libertarian parts of America I want to go to.

Being treated like convicts, minorities including myself not being able to have any say in politics due to it being democratic (only cares about majorities) and that our police don't care for oppressed minorities such as gun owners; male domestic violence victims, drug users etc. They only care about helping the state strip their rights due to being legal.

Anti-intellectualism, most of us think we should ""just comply"" with coronavirus regulations regardless of others' situations and that most Australians are so fearful of less gun control with SO MUCH arrogance.

Tall-Poppy syndrome, being so arrogant about America everytime they talk about that country despite not knowing much about it and thinking we're the best country when we have so many flaws.

Entitlement, most of us forcing others to be like us to have a ""right"" to safety.

Compliance, a word you cannot disagree with without harsh criticism from our culture. If something's illegal, our society automatically thinks its taboo.. Even women wanting to defend themselves with tasers.

However.. I don't know how to change my bitterness with Australia when my real self is taboo and that I don't feel very cared for by the system, I can't even find a single friend aside from a neighbour.

So where do I start...
I am a 42 year old male and I had been on medication for a number of years and recently my gp referred me to a psychiatrist, as my moods were still up and down and my temper short.. The psychiatrist during the first session decided that I didn't need medication and believed the short tempers and anger were a result of me being on a medication I didn't require...
I had been on this medication for the past 10 years and I had obviously forgotten what it was like to not take anything.. I went through the tapering of the medication and then through weeks of withdrawal symptoms I could barely function.

Once the side effects subsidered I initially felt ok but a few weeks of not being on anything I developed a huge knot feeling in my stomach from the time I woke up to the time I went to bed, it was their if I woke up at night even. My moods flattered and and I break down in tears often.. I am trying to exercise more, read positive quotes, spend time with my family but I am trying to think more positive but it usually gets shot down pretty quickly usually by me.
I haven't notice a results and can't find enjoyment out of anything or look forward to anything.

I had my first session with a psychologist last week tho this first session I don't walk away with anything and now it's another 2 wweeks before I can go again.. At the same time I'm worried and thinking is this the right person for me am I going to get anything out of it? Or am I wasting my time and in 1 month I'm no closer to getting out and then have to start all over again..

I'm very lost as I don't know if I should find a different psychiatrist and talk to them while I see a psychologist... Go back on medication, tho certainly not my first choice after what I went through getting off it.

Anyhow if someone has some magical advice it would be appreciated..

Hello,
i recently finally had the courage to speak to my GP and my family about my mental health. I‚Äôm now 6 months into medication and receiving occasional CBT. I think over the last month has been the best time I‚Äôve had in my life. The stress of HSC is still existent, but the medications really have alleviated the low moods. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. My question is: How likely is it that I will experience a relapse of both diagnosis's? Are they really lifelong illnesses I have to acustom to, or will it one day be gone?
 
cheers,

Hi 
Even though I am married with kids I feel so empty and lonely. I have never been great at making friends or keeping them, as a child/teenager I was always to scared to bring friends home because you never knew when my dad was in a good or bad mood and he is the type of person that thought everyone should think and believe in what he did and looked down on those who didn‚Äôt. So it was easier just not to have friends. 
 I am now in my late 30‚Äôs but I have spent the whole time until I was about 23 when I moved out of home, not having friends or at least A very few for a short time but no real close friends . Since being married and having Kids I am finding even harder to make or spend time with anyone in order to have any friends, so I pretty much gave up trying to keep any friendship. I had and the couple of people who I thought were my friends never made contact with me after I mentally decided not to try any more. 
 My husband doesn‚Äôt drive as he has poor eyesight so I have to drive him to and from work and because he works weekends only, I feel I can‚Äôt do anything because if I do I‚Äôll have to stop part way through to pick him up from work. He works weekends and I work during the week, so we never see each other, other then a couple of hours at night but then I‚Äôm dealing with kids, so no quality time together, which makes me feel even more lonely and empty. I am also finding I‚Äôm holding a lot of resentment towards my husband because of this but also because he doesn‚Äôt work during the week he spends time every week with his friends Playing games even if he has the kids he just lets them run wild and destroy everything while he plays his games. 
Because I‚Äôve never had a close friends or family members I‚Äôve never been able to talk to people about how I feel, this includes my husband and I feel Because if my insecurities with relationships I feel I‚Äôm holding my kids back as well and doing them more harm then good, which makes me wonder if they would be better off with out me.

Hi, I‚Äôm new here so I‚Äôll just spill it all out...I‚Äôm very depressed at the moment. I‚Äôm not sleeping, can‚Äôt fall asleep till 2/3am in the morning and on work days need to be up at 5am. I‚Äôm teary but hiding it well, I have no motivation and could sit in the chair all day and not move some days. I separated from my husband in January after 24yrs of marriage and even though I know it was the right decision I‚Äôm feeling very down for all the changes I‚Äôve had to go through. If it wasn‚Äôt for my 16yr old daughter who has been an absolute supporter I wouldn‚Äôt be here. I feel very isolated, really only have one friend. I‚Äôm on SSNRI for depression but mainly for pain and I doubt it‚Äôs working anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do, but I can‚Äôt continue much longer like this.

Hi everyone i‚Äôd appreciate any advice on what to do. I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I was having panic attacks at work and was prescribed sedatives to help manage these. My GP has since stopped these as he says I can‚Äôt take them long term. So now my panic attacks are back. I‚Äôm afraid that I will be fired if I can‚Äôt stop them, but without the medication I can‚Äôt control the panic. I phoned life line crisis support today and I did not find them helpful. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do? Thank you.

Having aspergers syndrome and low vision I'm trying to get onto the NDIS for getting assistance with depression and an OCD which has become worse.  I've found the treatment that will help, but need someone to advocate for me during the process.  

As short as I can keep this, I was heavily bullied at school with no friends, and with no understanding of autism at the time (late 1970s into early mid 1980s), no one really knew anything.  Like any teenager, my puberty gave me the usual sexual desires, but living in a catholic household, such personal moments of deep well being and pleasure were suppressed vigorously.  Anything that would allow me to explore my sexuality was taken away, and having no friends at school, things that people know about such endeavors at around 10 11 12 years of age, I never really got a grapple onto until I was around 23 24.  

The psychological and mental effects have been major.  The first of which was having no confidence in breaking into the world.  Aside from several tertiary courses, I've never seen paid work.  As discrete as my asperger's is (HFA), neurotypicals seem to just pick it up, and their behaviour becomes different.  It has been difficult to socialise, make friends, get into interests, and so fourth.  I've done a lot in my life, but friendships and involvements are often a come and go thing, usually the longest something lasts around is five or six years before it burns out from it's own course.  

I had no oxygen during my birth which also has effected me mentally, I need to keep things clean within a certain zone within my unit, which is managable under normal circumstances.  Having extra-sensory feel, means I can feel right down to if someone has touched an object in my clean zone such as secreted body oils being present on the objects surface.  I would clean it and life moves on.

However with some life changing events being a possibility, my anxiety and OCD has erupted a few times of late, meaning whole afternoons and evenings can be spent cleaning a sofa, or wiping down walls.  I've got a few of these inflatable things that completely suppress the anxiety when it hits, but I'm needing to get more of these made, which I can't afford, hense why I'm needing help to get funding from the NDIS.  It's a one off amount for a custom order and I'll be fine basically for several decades.  

I looked through google, but trying to track down someone who will assist with the paperwork and who will advocate looks confusing.

Tonight I received noticed of another failed job application. Another one of those ""Thanks but go screw¬†yourself"" emails.
Context: It was retail
Went for a job interview on Wednesday after completing their online shit, only to find that the person interviewing me was not there, had someone else come over to do the interview. I screwed up on the first question ""Tell us about yourself"". God¬†damn it shoot me now, I thought. I said what I need, previous retail experience in similar role, volunteering once a week, that was it. How much should they know? I can't talk about my interests because I am embarrassed by them. I told them my availability, my understanding of the job and that was it.
Now they sent me less than 3 hours ago the Go Screw¬†Yourself email. Well, screw¬†you too. They are going to regret this decision.
I have been on the job search for a long time now, failed art school, failed uni, last job was when I was 17. I volunteer once a week with a charity shop with warehouse stuff, donated furniture donations etc. I can't even get a job as a trolley collector, this is how screwed my situation is.
I am 25 but have the mind of a 85 year old, meaning I have done my bit for the world so let me die. And don't give me that ""You will get one eventually"" or ""You're 25, you're still young"". No I won't and No I am not. I have failed my family, my friends and myself. There is no hope for me. I am done acting civilised, that never works, we always get smeared. I will kill someone to get a job if I have to. Just give me a job so I can at least be happy for once

Hello all,
For the past few years I have been in a long distance relationship (>16000km). For the first couple years I was managing life well, balancing talking over the phone and studying. However, in particular, the last year I have felt so numb, to the point where I don't care what would happen to me. I felt like I had no reason to be happy, because I only felt truly happy when I was with my boyfriend. Then in between I just studied and was content with my loneliness. Slowly putting on a face more and more. As of today the last time I saw my boyfriend was over 9 months ago, and although we still have strong feelings I can feel my detachment growing. 
In addition, throughout the year from March, given the COVID situation I have been attending uni online. At the beginning, when there was the national lockdown, there was a period I didn't leave my house for 3 months. I gradually began to loose my uni friends. Something I have especially noticed in the last couple of months, because although restrictions have lifted, I don't seem to get invited to parties anymore, or when I message my then-friends, one won't respond for hours, and the other never responds. I feel like I have lost all of my uni friends. When I realised I was loosing my friends, I decided to join a club. The club was my saving grace. I met new people and had great fun. However, now activities won't resume for another three weeks and I don't know how I can cope. To make things harder, I met another guy there, which makes my situation much harder. Now I find myself torn about whether long distance is such a good idea after all. So on top of my loneliness and sadness, I find myself facing a life-changing decision. 
I know deep down that I'm so lonely, to the point of desperation. I need to experience joy and life with people around me. I feel like I need to feel energy and life again. I miss happiness. I need a hug, I need someone who I can talk to. I need a friend, I need to be touched and I need to be loved.

Hi all, I posted on here few years ago, life really does go
Full circle. Last time I was fresh out of prison in rehab for
Ice, was going great guns got clean and began to chase a
Career surveying. Nearly finished my cert 4 but stress
Of heavy court case and rehab stress, I pulled out 2 weeks
Before finishing a whole year of hard work. I relapsed
And started shooting up. I finished rehab and court and eventually
Got clean on my own. I haven't worked in 8 months not due
To covid. I got made reduntent relocated to another state and was living
In my car, my car blew up no insurance and had to go back
Home. On way home I had a breakdown and smashed a
Train up eventually got charged but I'm finished with
Court now. 3 months ago I was passenger in serious car crash
(Lucky) to be alive. I relapsed after the crash and got
Convicted for refuse roadside drug test. I've just lost my
Licence for another 2 years, and I just can't let it go

I've been here before over and over, but I just can't let it
Go, the strange thing is I was homeless past 6 months
Got a nice place to rent as an independent adult for the first
Time then I chose to drug drive and stuff it all up. My mind is
Racing so much ive been clean at least 2 months, but
I'm starting to feel too much, I can feel my life's stuffups
In my soul. I just feel like I'm too far gone mentally,
just watching myself and looking at photos of me in
The good days I don't recognise myself. My own voice
Just keeps laughing at me and keeps saying HOW MANY
TIMES DO YOU KEEP STUFFING UP AND NOT MAKE
ADJUSTMENTS? I don't know when the message will
Sink in.

Honest, Ive been having a premonition something
Bad is going to happen, everything has gotten real dark
Since the car accident and I don't have any friends at
All, no family, but then I remembered you guys, I
Love you guys ‚ù§Ô∏è god bless you and the work you d

He who truly believes shall have the gift of eternal life

Pray for me I really need it, sending out my prayers

My name is Sharra and I have been struggling with my depression for over a decade now. Despite the very hectic, overwhelming thoughts in my brain I can usually self-soothe myself to some degree, but lately I have been finding it harder. I recently decided to tell a couple of people about my suicidal thoughts, which was a very big step for me as I have generally internalised everything. One person could not handle this information at all, and one stopped speaking to me shortly after. I thought I would come here for some comfort and to feel less alone in my feelings, because I know everyone is hurting this year and feeling a lot, but I am really struggling to connect with anybody about my emotions.

So ive made good improvements on managing depression and anxiety over past year due to talking to psychologist ect
so ive been unemployed for few months like many others in Vic. Been hard dealing with been at home with mum and dad so much as just to much of same.
I picked up new job and its long hours living away from home, cutting hay during up coming hay season. And we have to take what we can at the moment as job market isnt great. Perticully in rural vic
so im glad to get out of house and away from home, but i feel gunna be alot of change at once and my depression doesnt do well doing when im tired i really strugglem big chages i dont cope well either.
I feel like ive been bottling alot of stuff up, can't see any of my friends as all live in melbourne and really struggle with no social side. 
Feel like ive been really dependant to talk to some alot via phone and feel like im driving them away and i cant deal with this. I feel like im really gunna put my mental health at risk and all in name of income. 
Lots of other things in my brain rushing though and cant even find a decent movie on tv at night to take my mind off things.
last time i had a breakdown it was pretty sketchy times and all cause i cause i couldnt control my mental health. I know it was while ago but still im scared starting new job and long hours will be final thing that trips it all up. 
i should be excited about going back to work but idk what is gunna happen. 
I was doing so well my phycoligist said we dint need to do seasions and doc wanted me to get off meds, now im here.

what does depression feel like? I was diagnosed with anxiety but I'm worried I also have depression. i really try to be positive. i try so hard but i dont think im trying the right things. i need something else in my life, i fear im going to regret not doing everything i wanted to do and try. i often want to cry but the tears just dont come out. I feel like if i cry, my tears are fake. The thought of crying feels like its a waste of time, or like these tears are wasted on me. I should let someone else who's struggling more than me cry them. ill be happy but there are these dark thoughts always sitting in the back of my brain, telling me i shouldnt be happy becuse i know i did bad on a test that im still waiting on the results for. Or I'll remember that soon ill have to come face to face with someone I really dont want to see. I feel like the little kid inside me has died. the part of me that always thought i could do and be anything. Im facing reality now and I realise that stuff is hard. and i dont think im tough enough to get through. I dont think I can do uni, and i dont think i can keep working in a job where I feel like Im reading a script over and over again as I make small talk with customers. I stop feeling real. I got this feeling when I caught a glimpse of myself in a reflective surface at work. Its like while I was working, i was in a trance and when I saw myself in the reflection, i suddenly remembered where i was and what i was doing. Life feels so different now Im officially an adult. Im finding fewer things to get excited about. im worried all the time, and this picture of who i want to be in my mind feels so out of reach. Impossible even.  
Is this what depression feels like?

Hi there, 
I'm not exactly too good at conveying my thoughts in a succinct manner, so I'm sorry if this get's confusing. 
As the title says I don't really feel anything anymore. I sort of walk around like some sort of robot, going through the motions, feigning happiness when I'm in my classes at uni and I don't know if this is normal? It's almost like my base mood is really quite low and flat, and that I feel empty as if there's nothing left in me. I don't genuinely feel happiness (only fleeting moments), I don't even feel sad a lot of the time, I just don't really feel anything.
I'll admit, I've put myself through a lot of sleep deprivation due to studying which started maybe around year 12 (so I've done it on and off for about 3 years), and my diet hasn't been the best so that could be why I feel low on energy at times, but I have been working on sleeping more instead of staying up late to finish work. 
Despite this, my low / empty feelings persist, it feels more than just tiredness. I don't care for things anymore. Things don't give me any satisfaction, I don't get really upset over things anymore (aside from when I'm super stressed from uni and break down haha), I don't get really happy over anything either. Music, the one thing which I swore I could never live without, which used to make me feel good, is now starting to sound like noise in my ears to block out the world. I don't really know why I am this way. 
I used to put this ""deadness"" down to my personality, I've been this dry/kind of emotionless person for as long as I can remember, but I think lately it's gotten a little worse. I was always told as a child to ""smile more"" or to stop being pessimistic etc. but now I've kind of begun to wonder whether this is just my personality or if it is something more? 
At times, on top of my low mood I get hit with really dark periods where I lose all motivation, I don't talk to anyone (not that I have anyone aside from my family to talk to anyway), I don't do anything. I just sit in bed and watch crap on netflix or youtube to distract myself from the thoughts. I feel that I cry more easily nowadays (and I don't really know why because I don't feel extremely sad) and these periods have started happening more frequently as of late. 
I don't know if this is depression. I don't have any real reason to be depressed. Is it all in my head? I really have no idea anymore. Has anyone felt the same way before?

I recently was made redundant. The sad thing is that the redundancy was not necessary, it was a boys club looking after their own. In a way, I'm glad to be out of that place as I was bullied and made to feel worthless for over 10 months. By nature I'm a people person, always putting others before me, helping with both their professional and personal issues. COVID then came and with a large team of over 100 people, it became a challenging task to support such as large team throughout these times. The company wanted me to fail and would not provide the support necessary. By nature, I wouldn't say I've always been an overly confident person, but prior to coming to my previous place of employment, I was at the top of my game. The consistent mind games and torture has changed the person that I once was. I now have zero confidence, no energy, and fearful for what the future holds. Being unemployed in these tough times has certainly had a major impact on me and my family. Having to see my son try to complete year 12 this year, the recent loss of my father and the state of my mother has been hard enough, now with the added pressure of being unemployed has impacted me immensely. As a father and husband, I have failed my family and see no way getting back to where I was a few years ago. For someone almost 50 yrs of age, I have an impossible challenge ahead. Having applied for many roles, I am over the constant rejections and at a loss of what to do. I feel like a burden to the family and want to just hide in a corner. Whilst I know there are many others in much tougher situations, it doesn't make things any easier. There are days when I am inspired to beat this and prove that I can be the person I once was. I have spoken to a few professionals, but each time feel that this hasn't helped me progress. I understand things take time and that the effort needs to be put in. But I also have days (much like today) where I just want to be on my own and hope to find this all a bad dream. As time progresses, my willingness to fight and look for employment is slowly diminishing. I just don't know what to do anymore.

Do you ever feel like you are facing a battle alone? How do you feel better when you don't know what is wrong? I have an amazing family, help from medical people...but I still feel lost. I wish someone would say...this is what is wrong with you. Sometimes I feel amazing....but more often defeated. I know this is weird, but I don't want to die, but I don't want to live. Do other people feel that way?

Hi all, let me start off by saying I believe there is a virus in the community.
Like most viruses, it has a far more tragic outcome on the elderly & those with underlying health issues.
Nothing new there I'm sure you'll agree?!
Onto my issue.
If you're like me, you're totally beyond being over this current Lockdown!
From being laid off mid May due to a lack of flights -I worked airside-to having more & more of my freedoms taken away & therefor, even the most basic of enjoyable pursuits also evaporating!
Like everyone, I'm stuck at home, not permitted to legally move outside a 5km radius from home & when I do, risking a $1600 fine!
For what?!
What crime have I committed?!
The crime of attempting to hold on to my sanity, to relieve stress & tension that's built up & clear my mind & refocus!
Basically, to keep the Black Dog on his leash & find a reason to wake up tomorrow morning!
I know under the State of Emergency Laws the state says I'm a law breaker but am I really?
I derive immense pleasure from jumping on my motorcycle & heading off for a ride.
Not to visit anyone, not to cafes, restaurants or pubs, just ride!
Heading off along the Great Ocean Rd, with no time limit or a real destination in mind isn't everyone's cup of tea granted but it's mine!
It's always cleared my head, ridding me of overbearing thoughts of dread & depression.
And now, through no fault of my own, this has been taken away by the state!
I've not had Covid-19
I don't know anyone who has
I'm not in the demographic that's high risk
So why am I in solitary confinement?
Isn't that a punishment handed out to convicted criminals, already found guilty of a crime & in prison!
In Victoria apparently not, it's imposed upon it's citizens in the city & surrounding suburbs!
Why can't I head off for a ride, on my own & find the peace, serenity & head clearing enjoyment I long for?!
Why are people not at high risk being locked at home, their outdoor activities limited to 2hrs & a 5km radius of their home?!
I need to clear my head
To get away from the same scenery I've had for the last few months
I need to get out for a decent ride, by myself!!

Hi. 
Feeling less than stellar - so joined for advice.  I have had a serious bout of depression/anxiety since March 2020, and I‚Äôm holding out && going downhill.  
saw my dr for the first time in 12 years and he want me in hospital for 2 weeks to change medication and observe.  My work has suffered due to poor performance that I am at risk of losing my job. I have a meeting in 1 hour. Do I disclose I am sick and will be away for this long? I have major deadlines - thought I could hold out and fake it but the cycle of fear/guilt/anxiety/depression means I‚Äôm honestly not going to survive.  Dr suggested admission on Sunday  
Potted history: previous & family depression, male, married, one teen son.

I am 33 years old, on the Autism Spectrum and completely at a loose end in my life.
There is nothing left to work for, nothing left that interests me and I am completely isolated because I struggle to connect with anyone. I struggle to connect with myself.
Psychotherapy isn't working (and I have been attending for many years, paying ridiculous sums of money to talk to someone who merely listens and writes, without any further 
I volunteer for homeless people, yet I feel so detached when I am volunteering, I struggle to connect and feel like a robot. I don't even know if I am helping or just going through the motions.
I work in a dead end job in supermarket retail, and have failed multiple degrees in the hopes of getting a better job. Not because I don't understand the work, but because I can't find the support that I need. 
I spend hours scouring on Meetup for relatively interesting meetups, but most are ""coffee and cake"", some of which I have been to.  I often sit, observing but unable to contribute much to the conversation. I have felt like this my whole life. Watching, observing, understanding, but unable to contribute. 
I feel like life has lost meaning and I'm going through the motions. I am agoraphobic, but I push through and often go to shopping centres and other busy places to remind myself that I am not alone. All this does is make me more isolated and exhausted. 
I go to the library, and read books, but get bored after most books that I am interested in have essentially the same information, and information that I can easily get off the internet. 
I was interested in music, and can play piano very well, but without community, what is the point? Depression has muted all of my interests and without a miracle, my days (besides working) consist of laying in bed with a weighted blanket, scouring information on the internet, hoping I can find a solution to my problems and binge eating.
My mother died when I was 13, my father is an alcoholic (whom I had to remove myself from 17 years ago) and my sister (who lives in another state) is depressed herself, and is unemployed.  My extended family have been estranged from each other for 20 years, there is no support. 
Chronic loneliness is ruining my life, and a visit to a random Meetup group is not a solution. 
When I do reach out, I am often met with ""Oh, I'm busy with the kids"" or, ""Find your own friends.""
I have no children either, not through choice either. 
I am struggling and need help.

I'm¬†feeling pretty helpless
I‚Äôm bipolar type 1, medicated for 3 years, and been experiencing paranoia and distrust towards people close to me.
i tried several times to chat with a clinician online but my internet keeps dropping out. I tried to chat to my partner about my intrusive thoughts/paranoia/distrust and he raised his voice and told me to go to hospital even though I said that‚Äôs not what I want to do at all. I feel like there‚Äôs no one I can trust or talk to I feel so isolated. I feel like even my closest friends don‚Äôt understand and that I can‚Äôt trust any new friends either. My paranoia is telling me my friends will try send me to hospital/abandon me/make fun of me/think I‚Äôm insane even though they haven‚Äôt shown me they would do that. It feels like my partner is turning against me and I‚Äôm a burden and whilst I understand a lot of this is ‚Äòin my head‚Äô, I‚Äôm having impulses to run away from everything/delete social media/break up the relationship/disappear. I know this isn‚Äôt rational or what I want to do but I tried to talk to him and it didn‚Äôt work and I kept feeling like he hated me and is doing things behind my back. I even have felt like my friends are plotting against me and I know that can‚Äôt be right but these ideas keep coming into my head. I just wanted to talk to my partner and have him reassure me but he struggles with empathy and emotional reactions and often jumps to anger as a response and it‚Äôs just affirming my greatest fears. I don‚Äôt know how to switch the paranoia off or deal with it. It‚Äôs starting to leak into every day conversations and the thoughts are becoming louder and louder saying I need to just run away from everyone. When I was younger I would do that, just pack a bag and disappear and it was quite unhealthy and unsustainable. I have a nice life here I don‚Äôt know why my head is telling me otherwise.
Does anyone have any idea how to cope with this ?

Hi there, I‚Äôve been struggling for a while mostly in denial about my wife‚Äôs condition. She has extreme mood swings which I have asked her to seek medical advice about as they are more changes of personality. Over the last year she has been drinking in secret, hiding bottles of wine in cupboards and this has progressed to hiding it in sports bottles. I have caught her a few times and she blames me for everything. I cannot talk to her when she has been drinking as the words that she says are too hurtful. I gave up all drink in an attempt to help her stop, we were good for two weeks then I found her drinking in the bedroom. She admits she is depressed and blames me, because we had three kids and she gave up her career and independence. 
If we didn‚Äôt have kids, I would walk away, but I don‚Äôt trust her with the children, especially as she drinks in secret. I have asked her to get help, she always finds and excuse, and how can I prove she is getting help? 
my work is highly stressful and I am juggling trying to keep my family together and not make a mistake at work. 
Do I involve her family? Do I ask her to leave? I want to help her, as I still love her and I don‚Äôt want to split my family. I feel I am slowly breaking and finding it hard to keep smiling for my children. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Hi, I‚Äôm new here and recently diagnosed bipolar 2. I have had major depression on and off for over 35 years mixed with some intense highs. 2 years ago a psychiatrist diagnosed cyclothymic bipolar and she has adjusted that to bipolar 2. I‚Äôve just started on medication but TMS and DBT have been suggested. The DBT courses are so expensive, $200 each weekly session, which is out of reach. I see a psychologist regularly but I really just ramble on when I‚Äôm there. He doesn‚Äôt do any particular therapy with me. Can anyone give me thoughts on TMS and DBT please. Or do I just stick with medication? I‚Äôm very aware of the thoughts in my head and my personality traits I need to change. I just have immense trouble changing them. Thank you for accepting me.

Hi,
I have been struggling with loving myself and being positive about who I am. I have had people who  were my best friends leave me for no reason. Then my guy best friend who had a relationship with me but then turned out he didn't kow what he was doing when I really liked him. Its been a while but I still feel like I am not good enough for him or anyone. Due to my childhood I have always had self-esteem issues. And somehow this situation escalated them. I feel unappreciated, worthless, alone and just not good enough. I don't know what to do. I can't not be friends with him because we have the same friends group and its hard not to see him but it's really sad and upsetting when I see him. He says he cares and is sorry but I don't know why I don't see or feel it in his actions. I don't feel happy about my life or anything anymore. Any help would be greatly appreciated thank you.

What is the point in being alive if we can't live our lives. Sick of the news and dictator Dan.
I get there are people out there who are sick but what life they have left to enjoy has been taken because of this lockdown.
I want to go into the high country to get away from people and I can't even do that. I am sick of feeling like a prisoner in my own home surrounded by demands and no escape.
I'm sick of not being able to go to work and having that incompetent excuse for a premier scold the majority whilst he allowed a minority to spread the infection and get away with it. We only have a short life as it is and we can't even be allowed the chance to enjoy that! I've done the right thing, my family and my friends have all done what is asked. Why should we all be punished because he couldn't get his government to do their jobs properly in the first place? I'm sick of being abused both mentally and physically foror his mess up.

Hi everyone!
It‚Äôs my first time posting here. I‚Äôve had dysthymia my entire life, only diagnosed a few years ago in my early 20s. I had always thought it was just the way I am. While I have never really been happy, I‚Äôve functioned really well, maintained healthy relationships and been generally content with my life.
I lost my job a few months ago due to Covid19 and I also have a chronic immune disorder, so I have been isolating hard core for the entirety of the pandemic. I think this combination has sent me spiralling. For the first time in my life, my depression isn‚Äôt a melancholic mist but a full bore hail storm. This is the first time I‚Äôve been really scared of how I feel and the thoughts I‚Äôm having, and I don‚Äôt feel in control at all. 

It‚Äôs also the first time my day to day functioning has been impaired and I just can‚Äôt find the ‚Äòoomph‚Äô to do anything, or even care about anything. I‚Äôm so listless and spend far too much time on my phone or laptop. 

Anyway! We all know the symptoms of depression, and I‚Äôm having them all right now. Thought it might help to connect with other people in the same boat. 

Hope everyone is doing as well as they can be.

Hi. I don't really know where else to go but I'm 21 and for the past year I slowly realised I haven't been feeling okay. I started drifting away from all of my friends and have had to take a few semesters off uni. Recently I had a panic attack at home and I'm not really sure how it came about but my parents have noticed that something was wrong but when I tell them that all the pressure from uni has made me feel anxious and depressed all they say is ""you can get past it, you're almost graduating"". This sort of manifested and ate at me for so long since they have such high expectations that most days I feel so unmotivated and now I don't really enjoy all the things I love doing.
Lately I find myself staying in bed til noon most days and my parents think I'm just lazy and not following what they say. Sometimes I feel like being with them in this house 24/7 is too much and those days I end up wishing I could move out so badly. My mum thinks that I'm doing all this to purposely hurt her but that's not true at all. She keeps asking me what's wrong and I end up saying that it's nothing cause every time I try to tell her I feel like there's something wrong with me she instantly thinks that it's a problem with how she raised me and she goes on about how this is her fault and that she doesn't deserve it and maybe I'm just ""lashing"" out and choosing not to listen to her since I'm a young adult and that makes me feel even worse about myself. My parents preach so highly that I can ""talk to them about anything"" but I feel like I can only talk to them about things they want to hear.
I can't open up to my mum since she feels like everything I do is me targeting her and the fact that she thinks I would do something like that hurts me. And my dad just agrees with whatever my mum ends up saying. Recently she got really upset at me staying in bed all afternoon that she forcefully booked an appointment with the doctor and told me that I need to fix myself. I get that she wants to try to fix things but I feel that this just wedges a gap between our relationship even more. I don't really feel comfortable seeing someone yet and I don't really know what to do anymore. Most of the time I just want to sleep since I feel so alone and empty inside.

Hi

I've been diagnosed with chronic depression for many 
years. I've damaged my spine and neck in accidents
and whilst I'm not confined to a chair find any exercise
brings on pain (throw in lower limb injuries as well).

Over the years I've seen both psychiatrists and 
psychologists. I have no faith in CBT, and I just don't
have the mindset to change it.

Of late I've started to believe that people are watching
me. Deep down I know they probably aren't, but it's a
feeling that won't go away. 

I'm starting to try to catch people out for looking at 
me. Not sure if they want to hurt me, but I don't trust
them.  I know I sound mad, logically I know it's not
happening, but at the times I check I'm not thinking
in a logical manner.

Does this make sense to anyone, or am I starting to
go down a slippery slope.

Hello,
I am new to forums and hope this is the right area to post this. Decided to come to this site because I need support, I have no support network that can help me with my problems. I have a close friend with the bipolar and she‚Äôs angry with me. She doesn‚Äôt tell me why and pushes me away. This has been happening for some weeks. It hurts me because she is important to me. I am so upset. She won‚Äôt communicate with me. Last night I sat outside and wanted to hurt myself. Self hurt has never come to my mind before even though I have depression and have had it for a few years. Only because of how it would impact my Mum that I did not hurt myself. My friend says I have problems and she‚Äôs probably right but without her telling me what I have done wrong I don‚Äôt know what to do. Self improvement is something I am prepared to do. I read on this site about bipolar but I can‚Äôt tell if the bipolar is the problem or if I am. I need help please, I am hurting so bad.

I didn't know if I should post again on beyond blue but here goes.

I'm just going to start off by saying I'm under a lot of stress at the moment. This year feels like a nightmare as we've been trying to move and we've had so many obstacles in our way. 

On top of that I'm trying to study a diploma of travel and tourism online. I'm almost halfway through and I'm supposed to film a few role-play for my current unit. I can't do that as the only person who can help is my dae and he works all the time. I don't even care about the course anymore as it feels like I'm mentally and emotionally fatigued most of the time anyway. Plus I'm not passionate about what I'm studying. And courses are terrible online. I can't say I'm the most social person but going to class is a million times better.

I also feel like there's a lot of pressure for me to finish this diploma by March next year which is the same time I'm supposed to start uni at the Gold Coast. If we hopefully get there. I currently live in Sydney.

I also feel really depressed about a few other things. I feel really bad that my dad works all the time and that I haven't been able to help out my parents more financially. I'm also frustrated that I don't really talk to my brothers much. 

Also I've never been on a date with a woman, I have no friends, I've never had a job and have never finished a diploma course. All in all I just feel bad about where I am in life. 

Recently I've been writing a lot more which makes me happy. I've also been trying to exercise a bit more. Although I've stopped going to tennis lessons altogether.

I almost got injured the last time I played went I don't want to talk to anybody there anymore since I'll be moving in the next few months. Although we've been talking about the Gold Coast for 3 years but there's been obstacles in the way. 

I guess what I'm getting at is that I feel stuck in life at the moment and I don't know what to do about it. I keep thinking maybe I deserve not to be happy. Everything I want seems like a pipe dream. I think about run away everyday and going anywhere else. If I didn't care about helping my parents then I would probably pack my bags and leave. 

I'm sorry for even posting this but I don't know who to talk to. Thanks for reading it.

John

The last two days when I've been out of my solo walks, I can't help but wonder why I am still here and every time I break down into tears.
I'm 37, I finished high school in 2001 and have gotten nowhere in life. I have never gotten any support or encouragement I feel out of place at home. Over the years, girls/women that ever expressed  an interest in me turned out to be only pretending. When a girl finds out I like her, they either say ""Ewww!"" or make prank calls to my home.
I've lately been watching videos on YouTube where returning servicemen surprise family members that haven't seen them for some time and it makes me think if I ever decided to join the services as something simple as an inventory specialist, I wouldn't answer letters from home nor would I return home on leave. 
When my cat had a vet appointment the other day, because of the stupid rules and restrictions, I couldn't even be in the consult room with him so I could talk about any concerns I had.
And every time I see on the news where police harass members of the public over something as silly as an old lady not being allowed to stop for breath on a walk while ignoring misconduct of ministers, it only makes it worse. It makes me feel sick.

Hi there,
I wanted to post about how challenging this year has been, as is increasingly clear with some hindsight.
Overall, its been an unrelenting set of largely unwanted circumstances which began with the bushfires and really took off after the coronavirus pandemic. I've nursed a failing relationship, have attempted to finish a phd, and am now looking to move interstate for a work opportunity. When I think about how hard this year has been I feel angry and depressed, and I can't help but blame the state of society. 
I know that everyone is having a tough time and by comparison I feel very grateful to have had opportunities in an objectively terrible time. But I feel stressed that my luck might run out, and that these hard times are not going away. Looking out into the world is simply nauseating however one looks at it these days.  
I'm wondering how other people are getting through this time ? Is there a solution that doesn't involve simply self distraction, and is instead framed through a holistic process of acceptance ? I find myself stressed and unable to find refuge in any thought of comforting future. 
 
Thank you

Hi all my first post.
 I recently resigned from my corporate job and have 1 and a half weeks till I finally leave, early May.
 The job pays 80k and I have no other job lined up, luckily I have managed to save money up but I could not cope anymore as my depression was overwhelming me and my workload was ever increasing. The company is very disorganised and I was given no training or handover with 4 major projects and management didnt care they expected me to deliver by working unpaid overtime.
 It came to a head one day when I started crying at my desk, luckily no one saw me. The work colleagues are horrible and evil, one of them was making fun of me saying I was going to fail in delivering one of the projects and another guy said I was too ugly to have a girl friend. I have been single for a very long time but have a few close female friends but I m in the friend zone only which probably only adds to my depression and loneliness.
The sheer workload every day makes me anxious and I struggle to get out of bed on workdays, even on my days off I cannot sleep and when I do I get out of bed at 1-2pm as I have no motivation whatsoever.
I have told them I am leaving for personal reasons as I plan to spend time with my elderly mother, I did not trust them to tell them I was depressed and unhappy in the company and my role. I actually asked for 3 months Long Service Leave but they said we were too busy and they couldn't let me have time off. I have 9 weeks sick leave and I sometimes think I should have taken the sick  leave instead but I know deep down I hate the job and the company and all that will do is delay the inevitable. 
I m scared of not having a job especially when I was paid a decent salary, I haven't looked for one as I don't know what to do, I don't think I can work anymore in evil greedy Corporate Companies that use you, I was only making the Execs rich working all the extra hours.
But I realise my mental health is suffering and I have to walk away from all the noise and get my health, happiness,  motivation and passion back. Its actually hard for me to apply for other jobs when I m so depressed all the time as this will show up in job interviews, its hard to hide. I am worried when I apply for jobs the fact I quit will go against me, but I did work for my current company for almost 10 years.
Has anyone been or is in a similar situation and give me advice, I m so unhappy all the time and hope it will lift when I  walk out the door.

Hi everyone, I have gone through a lot of rough things in my life.

I grew up half deaf after having grommets, I got golden staph infection in my right ear causing me to be a burden on my family with constant pain, medical bills and hinderance in learning. I wasn't able to get water in my ear, I didn't learn to swim, I couldn't make friends because I had blood and ooze leaking from my ear constantly.

I turned to food as a source of happiness, eating whenever I felt sad, sneaking snacks to my room even as a young kid. and I have been obese for as long as I can remember and honestly don't think I'll ever have the motivation or will to see myself become anything but obese.

My parents divorced when I was in kindergarten whilst also being used as a messenger of hate and bad words that I didn't know what they meant at the time and shortly after when I was in Year 2 my father started deteriorating as he had liver cancer, watching your dad wither away, vomiting blood and physically turning yellow; knowing that I can't do anything to help, just watching him die..

No friends, No Father and A Mother who treats me like shit. My brother was the only person I had. at younger ages he bullied me a lot but now as adults he's trying to be there because he wants me to be a present Uncle, but I can't get past the bullying and pain.

Getting into high school, I was a smart kid but I had literally no motivation to do anything or plans for the future, I thankfully had made a friend, she's the most wonderful human being i can think of, she's been through her own personal hell but always made sure I was okay. Later on in high school we tried to date, but I realised I was gay and she fully understood and supported it.

I stayed closeted until after highschool, my family was already abusive enough i didn't want that to be added on top.

It's been 5 years since high school. I am in a Polyamorous relationship with 2 boyfriends, one who feels like an Emotional Minefield, the other feels cold and unapproachable at times. I Do my best to try and make them happy but it gets to a point where I am sacrificing too much.

I am obese, no motivation, no true happiness- just the quick rush of winning an online game, I look back at everything and can count the few good things I have had happen to me quite easily, but it is extremely outweighed by all the negatives.

I keep continuing the cycle of waking up, just existing, eating, crying and sleeping.
What do I do, am I just being pessimistic?

Hiya. Sorry if this ends up a long or confusing read. I'm kind of all over the place.

I've been feeling really hopeless. I'm in my last years of school. Was diagnosed with anxiety in mid-late primary and depression in early secondary. I've been seeing a psychologist for a long time. But is there anything new for her to tell me? I have lots of little health issues; rarely serious but always stressful. As much as I do as my psych advises, I can't help how hopeless I feel about the state of the world. The climate is rising, covid won't be the last pandemic I see, world leaders are at each other's throats. It's all out of my hands.

Advice is always the same. I know that's because it's the best advice that can be given. But after so many years, it starts to hurt. And I never got to live the years everyone calls their best. So what's left? Working for things I'll never be able to afford?

It feels like there's so little to live for. Is all the emptiness worth the moments of happiness? I don't want to die. I'm not going to kill myself. But if I'm going to die anyway, I want it to be on my own terms, you know? 

I'm not sure what I want from this, honestly. Maybe just to vent. If you happen to have advice, or just a kind word, I'll be glad to hear it, though.

Thanks for your time.

Hi my name is Ewan. I have called Beyond Blue many times but never made use of these forums. I have suffered from major depression since at least 2006, and have been on medication since 2010. I try so, so hard to manage depression responsibly but nothing seems to work for long. I have done all the CBT and ACT stuff and am familiar with all the different psychotherapy theories. I meditate and exercise daily and my diet and sleep are generally very good. Nevertheless I still get very depressed. I was in hospital once in 2012 and again in 2016 for suicide attempts. I am in the dark place again now but am thankful I have been able to manage those kinds of thoughts thus far. I have worked so, so hard and somehow managed to obtain a masters degree in science from University of Melbourne, doing very well. In many ways things are much better now with my family life but for a long, long time things were very bad. My sister was in hospital over 40 times for major eating disorders, then drug problems, throughout my teens and early 20s. My mum has long term problems with eating disorders and prescription drugs, along with many, many other physical and mental health problems. There has never been a time in my entire life when I can remember her being far from crisis point. She is frequently in hospital - in the past for suicidal behaviour, now more likely for physical issues. I find the whole thing deeply depressing. She seems a lot better these days, and my sister has almost completely recovered, but I nevertheless feel as if some deep damage has been done to me and our family that will never heal. I feel a sense that I am doomed by my genetics to experience the same misery as my parents and sibling, and no matter how hard I try. I don't drink/smoke/do-drugs etc, but I still feel out of control emotionally. Recently both my PhD and relationship have completely fallen apart. I was no longer able to be a competent partner. I feel totally gutted by what has happened. I feel a massive sense of shame and disappointment with myself that never seems to go away. It's all just gotten too much and I can't see a way forward anymore. I also lost someone I knew to suicide recently that has created much hurt in my freindship group. Most of my friends suffer dramatically from mental health issues. I just don't know how to move forward anymore. I didn't sleep last night and have been having a lot of trouble ordering my thoughts. Thank you for letting me share this on this forum.

Hi everyone

Dont need to go into a long history about my mental health. Its obvious why I'm here. And honestly I'm sick of being kicked while im already down for the past 3 years. Glandular fever and chronic fatigue in 2018. Still glandular fever effects as well as chronic tonsilitis in 2019. Now 2020, severe anxiety disorder and depression resurgence from when I was a teenager, and a global pandemic happened. I have also been struggling since March with chronic bum fissures and constant irritation in my private parts. I'm a 21 year old lady and all these particularly intimate issues are getting me down the most... both issues are trying to be worked on but with no luck so far with treatments. I am just so so sad so often. Anxiety used to be my primary problem but with everything going on with my health ive been more depressed than ever. I also am struggling with chronic fatigue again, with no obvious cause apart from possible mental fatigue. The fatigue makes it really hard to just live and function and to cope with my other health issues.

I just want to give up alot of the time. I feel like i should be grateful that i dont have a life threatening illness but what i do have has made me lose so much confidence in myself as well as getting me so down. Is there a way out? Will things get better?

I'm so lost on what I'm doing. My phone has been taken away because I have been doing a lot of stupid things to try to get over my ex-boyfriend. I have lost my trust with my parents and I have been feeling unsafe in my house for many months now. My mum doesn't understand mental health and she even have drinking problems which doesn't help me cope either. I haven't seen my psychologist since January which is when I was at what I thought was my lowest point but I'm now at my lowest and I feel trapped. I have only talked to my grandmother and uncle about how I feel because they understand me more than anyone in the world. I want to feel safe somewhere and I don't want to feel like rubbish anymore. I'm numb and I just don't know if I can stand it anymore. I'm not honestly sure what to do. My own sisters don't even care about my feelings.

I have rapid cycling bipolar and have been medicated for the past 5 years. A couple months ago I had gastric sleeve surgery as a result of the weight increase from all the medication and their wonderful weight increasing side effects. My psychiatrist was aware of this, but however due to covid we haven't had an in person consult since feb. I've lost over 20kg very quickly and this caused me to have a manic episode, I assume because the medication didn't get altered in time, when he was told I was manic by my mother he lowered my medication.
So a week later I had to go to the ER as I had a lot of uncontrolled movements in my face, arm and leg.  ER dr thought I had developed tardive dyskinesia from my antipsychotics. I got an injection and sent on my way home. My psych and gp believes however I had developed Dystonia and came to the decision to stop all medication at once to stop the symptoms. I went the through the worst week of withdrawals, I don't even remember it. I'm at the end of week 2, the dystonia symptoms have totally stopped and I'm so miserable. I can't go back on anything just yet. 
I'm having such a hard time controlling my bipolar. I just need some tips, I have one more week to go before we try new medication. All I want to do is sleep, but I haven't slept properly since this began. I don't want to be around people because the moment I start socialising I start winding up and getting over excited and talking gibberish or I'm incredibly rude. I'm paranoid because I feel like everyone thinks I'm manic and are looking as me as if I'm crazy. I do know a lot of this is still side effects from stopping cold turkey.

Ok so I‚Äôm going to start a post where I‚Äôll just going to check in when I feel like I want to with how I‚Äôm doing  day to day. So Wednesday & yesterday mum was nitpicking at some symptoms/signs of depression I‚Äôve been having again despite being on antidepressants. I‚Äôve also been experiencing feeling like I‚Äôve had way to much sugar/coffee which I don‚Äôt and just today I had this quite big spurt of energy which I have no idea where it even came from  & nor have I ever experienced something like that before.

Today was a very difficult day for me as I had to do probably my first working from home induction for a new job. My mood has been getting progressively worse the second half of this year but the irritability/low frustration tolerance/ brain fog have been tricky to handle and today learning some pretty frustrating technology over zoom was quite the experience. Can someone direct me to any other threads about dealing with the cognitive issues connected to depression or bad stress/ anxiety im not sure whats to say the cause is yet. I question if its bad stress but the way I'm waking up of late makes me think its depression but will see my psych next week. Anyways at least Covid in Melbourne is going in the right direction so that with help people' mental overall. Cheers

Hello I recently turned 25 and have been having trouble with getting my life on track. I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for since i was 15. I was a drop out and semi shut-in after stuff with school and received consoling from 18-21. I haven't been able to get a job and don't know what to do. I don't hold a driving licence I live in a country town we don't have a proper driving school and have been struggling to find any unskilled work. I recently completed a course with jobseeker program but even though I have completed the course I have not received a certification for it due to them having been audited. Apparently their parent company what doing dodgy paperwork which has resulted in everyone in the course having to come back and redo paperwork. I have been back to them 6 times over the last year trying to get the certification and have been told time after time that everything is finally done only to not receive the certification. I don't know what to do at this point. Its started to make me depressed and giving me anxiety.

Hi,

I'm stating to feel really low and negative about myself and my depression is starting to rear its ugly head. I keep questioning why am I here as I feel I don't have a purpose and keep thinking negatively about myself.

I'm 26 currently living with my parents I've been saving for house which I've done really well but the housing market just always seems to hard to get into and I feel like singles and millennials are automatically set up to fail as the market at the moment seems like it's set up to benefit investors. It's always been my dream to own a home and would love to buy a old home and renovate it I love restoration projects. However it's really deflating seeing old properties overpriced online and you know some investor is just going to knock it down and build a new modern town house on top.

My love life is also a bit of a mess I was friends with benefits with a guy for 9 months we recently had the big what are we talk. I wanted a relationship he's young and polyamourous so he didn't want a relationship as I'm not polyamourous and even though I said I would be fine with it he knew deep.down that I wouldn't and he didn't want to hurt me. We want to stay friends but it's very painful for me at the moment and it's hard cause he had become my best friend. It's also hard as I'm in Melbourne in lockdown. 

One of the things that sucked was that he said I'm so put together with my career and how I'm a good saver and tried to use the whole I deserve so One better argument. This hurt the most as I don't care about my career I would give it all up for the person I love and I don't feel like I have my life together.

I feel like all I want in life is to be happy with someone I love in a house of my own where I feel safe and create amazing memories.

Hi
I am new to Beyond blue. I am writing here today because for quite some time I have been feeling depressed and lonely.
before I go on I would like to say that I have a profound intellectual disability called Aspergers Syndrome which is a form of autism. This affects my social skills as I struggle in social situations and with social skills.
 I am a very shy and introverted person and I like staying home. For quite some time I have been trying to meet a nice woman who I could have a girlfriend/boyfriend relationship with. I have spent a lot of money on Dating websites/Apps and had no success.
Unfortunately I have experienced bullying as I have been discriminated against because of my disability. I am a volunteer at a Salvos store and I cannot do a ‚Äúproper job‚Äù because I fear I will make too many mistakes. I really want to find a partner but I am feeling like I will be single for the rest of my life  and that is not a nice feeling.And that no woman will ever want me or love me.
 I really struggle with social skills and in situations and I have been told off by women in the past because I made a mistake and I feel frightened that this might happen again.
someone once said to me that ‚Äúeveryone needs someone‚Äù but when I try to talk to people and I tell them about my disability they have immediately stopped talking to me.
This has really gotten me down and I feel sad that no one will even give me a chance. I feel worthless and that women believe that there will always be a better Man out there for them than me.
 I am new to posting on forums and I am not sure if this is the place to talk about this but I just wanted to talk to someone about it. I know that I am not ten years old anymore and I have to take responsibility but it can be hard as feelings can be overwhelming even if I don‚Äôt want them to be.
Is anyone else in a similar situation to me?
 Thank you

Hi. I‚Äôve been taking an antidepressant for two years to manage my anxiety and depression. I‚Äôve recently stopped taking it as I want to change meds and I‚Äôm kinda suffering really bad. I‚Äôm currently taking another medication until my doctor prescribed me another med to take.
basically, just feeling really depressed at the moment and struggling with my anxiety. I can‚Äôt help but feel alone and helpless. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôm lost. I was going to call 000 for help as I didn‚Äôt know who to go to or where to go. I live with my husband and two dogs. Almost an hour away from my mum, dad and siblings. I feel isolated and alone. I can‚Äôt cope. I just needed to let it out. I‚Äôve got other issues going on too at the moment. I‚Äôm just very overwhelmed and everything is too much. I can‚Äôt cope.

I have a question I would like to pose to anyone who has successfully found their way out of a depressive episode.

What changes did you first notice when a depressive episode was reaching it's conclusion? My follow up question would be how did you make the most of the changes to continue on the path to mental health?

I have been in the midst of a severe depressive episode for years now so for a long time the world has been a murky, foggy, isolated hell. Lately however I have noticed some changes in how I relate to the world. Formerly I was using my television to create noise to keep me company and distract me from my obsessive thoughts. It didn't matter what I watched, I mostly watched the same things over and over actually, the familiarity was a source of comfort. Over just the last week I have come to realise I am watching things out of a genuine interest again. And not only that but I can concentrate for lengths of time when the viewing material engages me. It may be a pleasurable activity for me again.

This seems like a small victory but it appears to me to be like a light finally shining through that fog of disconnection and despair. Should I take this to be an early step in recovery? Or is it possibly just a freak lull in symptoms? Either way what can I do to take advantage of this slither of sunshine between barely parted clouds?

I am incomprehensibly excited that I have finally enjoyed something again even if it is something as basic as watching tv. It has ignited a flicker of hope no matter how small.

I feel so worthless, not good enough, lack confidence, have fear of failing or making wrong decisions, i feel like i am disappointing myself and others all the time. These feelings have been with me since childhood and I am 35 now. Its like this darkness thats always there in the background and just intensifies during difficult times or percieved difficult times. As I am getting older it is more complex and intense. Im aware of thoughts i have, but I find it so hard to dissociate from them. I get so involved that they exhaust me, paralise me and stop me from taking action towards things that matter to me. This then makes me feel even worse because then I just feel pathetic and weak. I just feel like I don‚Äôt deserve life since I can‚Äôt live and I know as I get older it will only get worse. I even started being forgetful, can‚Äôt focus and lost motivation completely.


This is my current situation where the above affect me: Currently I am due to go back to work from Maternity leave in couple of months but I really would prefer to look for another job. I have been working for this employer for almost 10 years and I really feel like I need a change because towards the end I was feeling miserable at work but stuck around due to maternity leave. The factors that are stopping me from looking for another job are: feeling bad that i will let my employer down, thinking I am not good enough/not competent enough, fear of being rejected, thinking someone else will get it anyway, also being indecisive of which path to take because i dont want to wrong decision. Not working for 10 months also did not help my confidence. All of this makes me feel so useless and worthless. I hate being the way I am. I feel that most people have their life figured out by now and seem to be more successful, doing better and coping well with life.  I just feel so pathetic and useless, like i am not capeable of living. This current situation has made me so depressed. I‚Äôve been loosing sleep, i lost my appetite, i lost joy in things and i have absolutely no motivation for anything. I attend to my baby and his needs and then clean house when i have energy but thats about it. By end of day i feel so exhausted. I just feel so useless and like a failure. 

I feel bad for my son too, I really dont want him to end up like me but how can I teach him things that I can‚Äôt figure out myself. 

I just dont know what to do. I feel like there is no way out and that i will forever be stuck with being like this.

Hi, I just need some help to understand what is wrong with me. I‚Äôm not originally from Australia but the uk and I‚Äôve lived here for 3 years, the past 2 with my partner who is Australian. 
I suffered with depression around 10 years ago in the uk due to an abusive relationship and spent many years looking after myself and thought I got through it. 
this relationship is the first since and things are ok my partner loves me dearly I can trust him but I don‚Äôt see anything good in my life and it‚Äôs ruining everything. We struggled with his family accepting our relationship and how toxic they were to him, so we moved and he has been very supportive of everything to do with our life however I feel like I am alone and push him away. I don‚Äôt have many friends that don‚Äôt have their own life or kids That will be that friend I guess I need. My partner works fifo so I am quite alone a lot of the time. We are in a semi rural part of Australia and moving further  isn‚Äôt an option but being where we are means little options for me to meet people. I am out of touch with the things I enjoy because I can‚Äôt reach it here. I just feel alone and lost and like my severe depression from years ago has come back and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I go to sleep hoping I won‚Äôt wake up. I don‚Äôt feel like I have a purpose or use and that I‚Äôve become dependent on my partner when that‚Äôs the last thing I want to do. I hate myself how I look how I feel and I don‚Äôt know how or what I can do to make a change

I'm trying to finally get on top of my depression and have recently been back to my doctor to change my meds and she said I should start going to a psychologist again, but I don't know who to go to, as i've only gone to talk to someone back in my home town and now that I live in the city (Melbourne) I don't know where to start. Been looking online but it's so hard to know if someone is actually good from their bio's alone, and my doctor didn't know of any that weren't booked out for months. Just trying to find someone good because I've had bad runs with psychs in the past and I know that it really takes a lot out of me to actually talk to someone, like I seem to have a major setback in my illness for a few days afterwards so I don't want to go through that with someone who may not be good

Hi all,
I have been depressed from some years now and I have been struggling to find my place here in Australia. I moved here for love as my husband is Australian. He knows how I am feeling and although we speak about it a lot he can't really empathise as all his family and friends are 1 hour away and mine are 30 hours on a plane...
Due to the travel restrictions and my PR status, I am not able to leave the country which I thought it was okay during the worst times but seeing all the information about being trapped here until next year,2 years or waiting for the vaccine(?) is making my anxiety go wild. My close family(parents and sister) are overseas and not knowing when I can see them is really affecting me. I really struggle to keep my worry under control and it doesn't help all the news about it. My home country and family got hit really bad, and Australia's number is nothing comparing to what Europe went through but they were never stripped from their right to leave their country.
Sorry for the rant, just want to see if anyone else is in the same situation and it would be helpful to hear how are they coping.
Thanks

Hi all, 

I went to the gp again last night looking for some relief from the constant crushing depression and she suggested my issue may not be depression but rather bpd.

From what I have read a fear of abandonment is at the heart of the bpd experience and that doesn't fit me. My closest friend of several years said to me a few months ago that she could no longer deal with my mental illness and never wanted to speak to me again. I said ok no problem and immediately felt a wave of relief that I didn't have to hear about her life anymore.

So what do you think? Is it still possible to meet bpd criteria without that fear?

Ok everything I‚Äôm gonna say think of it as not psychically. 
So I sometimes wake up and my head feels like there‚Äôs a loud sound inside it (again not literally) I don‚Äôt know how to explain it I don‚Äôt feel pain, I don‚Äôt know why I would be scared, I don‚Äôt hear noises or have any psychicall symptoms just want to hold my head and I squeeze my eyes tight! My heart would sometimes be pounding and other times not. I tend to be ok falling asleep I just lose track of my thoughts quickly and have I have more awareness of my pre sleep visions which can sometimes cause me distress. But anyway my head all of a sudden after waking up just feels like it‚Äôs vibrating (not literally) kinda like I‚Äôm stuck in my own head but I‚Äôm not actually thinking of anything besides ‚Äúcalm down your fine‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt last to long and I can get back to sleep fine. I tried to explain it to my psych but she didn‚Äôt really give me any idea what it is. Hope someone can help

Hi all, 

I just wanted to share a few thoughts I have about depression being a misnomer.

One frustration of depression is the internal experience differing from what it looks like on the outside.
Friends have said to me for instance that I am refusing to enjoy life or have fun. However from my perspective I am just incapable of enjoyment while I am going through a depressive period. I think this stems from the incorrect view that depression is the same as being sad or low. After all when they felt low they engaged in positive activities and felt better. Thus they don't understand the experience of the condition as opposed to simply being depressed. 

As our understanding moves away from  viewing depression as a feebleness of the mind and towards seeing it as a condition that impacts on both mind and body I really do think we should consider reterming it altogether. This would help move away from misconceptions and towards a more nuanced appreciation of the illness. It would help alleviate at least one frustration experienced by sufferers.

Thoughts? Feelings?

Hi everybody,
I came on this site some months age, stuck around for a while then wandered off. I've come back over the last couple of days. Life has been a little tough. I moved from Adelaide to Melbourne last November and have spent 6 of the 10 months I've been here in some form of lock down. The isolation has been difficult to deal with (I live alone). I usually spend a lot of time on my own and generally prefer to be by myself. I don't really form strong social networks. I usually get my social contact through work but obviously I don't have that right now. It has been difficult to link up with health professionals, so only been only the meds to get through this. I have been able to hook up with some doctors which has made life a lot easier. 
I still struggle and the hardest things to deal with are sleep and work. My sleep is all over the place at the moment. In fact, I can't remember the last time I fell asleep before 3 am. The other thing is work. I don't function well in an unstructured environment and home lacks the structure I need to stay productive. Before I moved here, I lived in two bedroom apartments and I always used one room as an office. I'm in a single bedroom here so I don't have a dedicated space for work. I have fallen behind on a lot on work tasks - something that is causing some stress. I've been trying a lot of things to fix this but haven't yet come up with something that works.
Anyway, that's my life right now. I guess it could be worse.

There‚Äôs no point. We live and then we die. 
my husband is dead. He was my everything and now there‚Äôs no point in continuing. I wish I could die. 
I have spent my whole life trying so hard to be a good person, someone lovable but now there‚Äôs no one. My family have not supported me at all since my husband died. I have no one to talk to or share anything with. People might say, let me know if there‚Äôs anything I can do but what can they do. They can‚Äôt bring him back, they can‚Äôt make it hurt less. There‚Äôs nothing so I say nothing and hurt on my own. I can‚Äôt do this. This isn‚Äôt a life and I don‚Äôt see any hope that it will get better. Every day I wish I could die. 
what is the point in trying to feel better. Terrible things will happen and there is so much pain still to come in my life.

This has been a long journey and still undiagnosed. I‚Äôm just coming out of number 5 MDE, all suicidal but no attempts.  I have realised that my husband has been one of the hurdles in me getting the support that I need. 
I have been scared for a long time to get help and felt like I am to blame and have to save the relationship before myself. 
it actually feels refreshing to have this realisation but I do need help with it. Because I do value my marriage - it‚Äôs great when things are great. 
sorry for the ramble - not the clearest mind today.

I don't know how to start one of these so i will just get into it.
I enjoy barely anything anymore and I am constantly isolating myself. I can eat a lot like a lot for one week and then go without food for three days with little water. It's hard to sleep taking around 2 hours to fall asleep. I self harm sometimes and have daily thoughts on suicide. I get angry very easily¬† My Stepfather used to pick me up by the ear and chuck me into my room, he even used to hit my head and tell me to toughen up a lot. I don't usually talk about this anymore because the last time I did (which was to my parents) they said ""everyone is feeling the same"" and walked away. I also believe i have ADD, I get distracted easily, find it really hard to do school work and I am always loosing things only 5 minutes after putting them away somewhere.
I also don't know what to say at the end so i will just say, bye and thank you for your time.

I'm 36, wife and two young kids. I have an undergraduate degree, a masters in accounting and am a CPA working for a bankp1. It sounds great on paper but everyday I feel like a pretender to the degree that I have been diagnosed with depression.

I work as a management accountant which does not require any skills whatsoever and now I feel like I know nothing. Like I cant remember anything I've ever learnt and it has gotten to the degree that I'm scared of making mistakes. Even small mistakes where ""it's ok to fail because it's just another step of learning"". I feel lke I'm worthless. I look at my kids and cry because I feel like they have a worthless father who will get made redundant and will end up as a loser. This unreasonable thought is affecting my life and my work even though nothing has happened yet!! All I know is that I dont want to do it anymore but I dont know what else to do. I have read things like ""do what you are passionate about"" but I'm not passionate about anything other than my wife and kids. But this won't pay my mortgage or put food on the table. Not sure what to do..

So despite the fact that I'm posting this in the depression forum I'd consider myself a pretty happy person overall, I just didn't know where to post this and depression seemed like the best fit, so my apologies in advance. Basically, everything in my life is going great except for the fact that I seem to have lost the ability to emotionally connect with others. I've noticed that I fake my emotions often and pretend to be more interested/invested than I actually am in people because I either don't want to hurt their feelings, want to gain something from them, or I just feel a strong compulsion to behave normally to preserve my 'image'. 
 
I'm averse to standing out in any way (good or bad) and go to great lengths to keep a low profile whether at work or uni or just my social circles. I feel anxiety from being noticeably different from others and thus will not let people know how apathetic I truly am on the inside. The irony is that I want to emotionally connect with others but I can't seem to genuinely feel anything for them, even though they're mostly amazing people and had I met them when I was younger I would have definitely felt close to them. I think this apathy stems from just my terrible past friendships, relationships and familial trauma. Over the years I've had to dissolve many close relations with people I've cared deeply for and now I'm starting to think I'm emotionally burnt out as a result. This is going to sound sociopathic but I view like 90% of the people in my life as disposable. I know I feel next to nothing for most of them and that the only reason I'm not a full-blown sociopath is because I have enough empathy and integrity to realise they deserve to be treated better and I would feel terribly guilty for hurting them, so I treat them with compassion, commitment, support and 'perform' my duties in whatever capacity they need me to be. 
 
I don't know if I should continue down this current trajectory or make an attempt to 'feel' again. It's not that much of an issue but nonethless it alarms me, and I wonder if it warrants going back to therapy. I apologise if my problems seem trivial in comparison to a lot of people here struggling with depression, I hope I haven't offended anyone and that my internal verbiage isn't too difficult to follow. I'd appreciate any insight/advice.

So this girl used to be extremely close with me then things started going downhill... she started being different. She says she's got depression which I think is from other guys in the past which have hurt her and this may be a reason why she does certain things. She always brings me close and then pushes me away. She's told me she's scared we will get close again and she doesn't want to be that close so she pushes me away. (I've tried telling her that I don't want to be that close and just want to be friends) it's confusing what she does, one moment we are talking good and are happy and then the next moment she's pushing me away and says she doesn't want to talk to me. I don't get what causes her to be nervous after she seems very comfortable and happy to talking. Some reasons which she mentioned were that she gets nervous, she is uncomfortable, she doesn't want to get too close again.

She told me that she is not used to someone caring so much for her and says she is nervous and scared. She also said:
""i know there aren‚Äôt many nice people in life. but i‚Äôm not used to it and it‚Äôs scary""

""I don't like it""

""i know it sounds dumb to push someone away who‚Äôs nice to you but it‚Äôs overwhelming""

""i don‚Äôt want to be hurt but i‚Äôm not used to people treating me this good and it sounds dumb but i don‚Äôt like it""

So that's what she said... I have given up on chasing her and I said I won't talk to her but I will always be here if she needs anything. Anyone know why she says that and thinks that way though? Will she realise maybe that she has lost someone good in her life?

Hi, I am very new to this and have read through many other threads (which have been great in making me feel like I am not alone) but I just felt I should write a thread to see if anyone else would relate or if what I'm feeling even makes sense, or if I'm just being overdramatic. 
Anyway, ive found that lately my rollercoasters of emotions have been that much more draining. Thinking back through my memories I recall times where I was over-hyper, to the point it was incredibly embarrassing and left people almost uncomfortable. Or periods where I was depressed and turned to going out every weekend and over indulging in everything I really shouldn't be.
But lately day to day life has just become confusing. Working shifts have become a period of intense happiness and then just dull separation from my surroundings. I am either happy or incredibly full of rage, taking it out on my family and arguing so intensely over minute things that the neighbours can hear and I then sit in my own shame. Small inconveniences in my relationships and upsetting people have left me wanting to remove everyone from my life and run away. I would love to sometimes live in a void of nothingness, which sounds silly but I am paranoid of everything. I push people away based on my own preconceptions for months at a time. I live with someone who is experiencing their own detrimental problems and seeing this makes me want to take control and steer my life in a better place than theirs.
I'm worried that my emotions are starting to take more of a hold of my life - how I act in the workplace and my relationships. Usually I would be able to keep these things to myself. I fear that ultimately i'll reach a level of chaos and leave destruction behind that I will never be able to clean up and that everyone will view me as a horrible person. But I have a heart and all I want to give is love yet all that comes out is neglect for others or crazy highs where I would be able to take over the world and succeed and that nothing really matters because I perceive myself as a future godlike person. That sounds so very silly but I dont know where these emotions come from cause it isn't who I really am or want to be.
Im rambling at this point but if anyone has any idea on how I can dampen these waves that seem to take over me I would love to talk to you and discuss anything that may come to mind :)

Hey everyone, I've been really struggling with the negative impact I've had on someone else's life and the separation anxiety and feelings of guilt that has come of it. I have recently stopped talking to my ex-girlfriend, We dated for 2 years and for the most part it went well however i was not totally engaged towards the end of it and made some terrible decisions that tore us apart and eventually ended the relationship. What hurt the most was we still had love for one another after the breakup, even despite the fact of what I had done to her as well. I was holding onto her because I still loved her and wanted to make things work but I knew that the destruction I had caused was too much for her and that i had to let go. Things ended peacefully and we both gave one another the closure we desired but I just can't shrug the pain.
This has been really hard for me and it hasn't been the first time something like this has happened to me. I am pursuing professional help and have made conscious efforts to try and rid myself of the negative behaviours that keep leading me into these predicaments, but letting go of her and processing the guilt is proving difficult. Has anyone else gone through something similar and have any advice to give?

 Animal sickness, death
Possibly toxic parents

I am currently doing a year 12 equivalent. I managed to get past the last semester of school with really good marks but I'm still mentally exhausted from the last couple of weeks of tests and assessments.
Didn't help that an animal companion of mine was dying and had to be put down just a couple days before starting. I watched him stop eating, drinking and he lost a lot of weight. It hit me hard as I knew at the start of his last 48 hours there was no chance of recovery. He was a small animal so it's harder to determine what exactly had made him this way and it was harder to find out on his species. Unfortunately small animals will try to hide their illness. His birthday was only a couple of days before. I wish I could turn back time but I can't. I can't change what happened to him.
My mother was quick to mention the vet bills, it hadn't even been half a day. Yet she was even ""upset"" about putting him down. That wasn't the last mention of money either. The next day was my father's day with me, the day after school. He has emotionally blackmailed me in the past that still effects me.
School didn't start on a good point with me already being depressed and now mourning. I'm pretty much a zombie and I fail to complete my first assessment - a report. It was a simple report to do but being depressed, sleep deprived, starved (starving myself = no energy) and dumb, doesn't lead to much good. I find it hard to ask for help and it doesn't help I'm a bit of a perfectionist (I'm insecure about not being smart).
Believing I was out of the course I texted my mother (I was too scared to do it in person) while my father was still around as I was afraid of being yelled at and kicked out. I expressed that I was upset about it and did not what to talk about it right away. She didn't respect my feelings and wishes... I stayed at my Grandma's and with her calm touch things were getting better and we finished the report together.
Now a weeks later I am in a similar situation again... very stressed and still depressed... my mother knows it's overdue... she did offer to help once but I was currently angry as I remembered about all the times she yelled, ignored and degraded/belittled me... So today has been a mixture of anger and crying... Am falling behind as we speak both school and mental health wise... I am just feeling like I'm mentally destroyed
Will try to mention to my therapist...

Depression for me seems to be a circle of problems. I'm always exhausted, so I can't work more than a few hours a week. Because I can't work, I don't have enough money to see a psych or go on meds, and I can't get any Centrelink support unless I'm looking for full-time work. Then the person I live with criticises me for 'sitting around all day' which makes me feel worse, and we loop back to the start... I just wish things weren't so expensive, or that psychological help didn't come with a huge bill. I was on the medicare rebate, which dropped my fee down to $25 a session, but I had to quit my job (because of the depression) and now I can't even afford that. I guess I just feel stuck.
Has anyone else been in a similar situation, or have any tips on how to get out of it?

The vast majority of carers do not have any training to be a carer. Most times they are simply partners that fall into that role. So how do they cope? 

Unfortunately when the mentally ill are unwell we tend to drift into the ""it's all about me"" syndrome. This is natural as our minds fund the basic tasks daunting. Symptoms like insecurity, headaches, feelings of low self esteem and exhaustion find us with little patien f2f e even towards those reaching out to us. 

Regardless of our depression and it's associated difficulties we still have an obligation towards our carer. For example: if you feel bedridden but you are capable in attending the bathroom or answering your phone or watching TV then when your carer returns home from their job, you are capable of making him/her a cuppa. A simple form if expressing gratitude. That basic task is symbolic in expression of respect. 

Many carers end up with stress related issues over time. They run a household, often work, listen to our struggles and don't have anyone to listen to theirs. This can wear a carer down to the point of wanting to escape. Carers need care and appreciation, the least we can do is show it when we have the capacity to do so.

Consider respite for your carer. Encourage them to socialise even if you cannot join them and a hobby. Their contentment in those areas will create a good balance rather than a life of work and caring with no end in sight of any substantial improvement in our depressed state.

Carers need us too. 

Are you a carer? Do you have ideas on how your ""patient could help you?

hi, idk what to do.
I've reached the point where I have no clue what to do with my life anymore. It has no direction and I am lacking any sort of motivation or ambition. I have felt rather numb as of late, but I've found I am very good at pretending I'm okay in the presence of others. 
I'm currently trying to apply for universities for degrees I know I am qualified for but at the end of the day I know deep down I have no passion or drive to endure. I cannot imagine a future self, something I have personally struggled with for years. I have no clue what I want to be, what I want to do, or what even makes me happy.
I feel as though I have lost myself by trying to please others and its gotten to the point where I don't know who I am. I don't have any motivations, ambitions or undying passions. Everyone around me has some sort of direction, some people have everything planned out, others have numerous spontaneous pathways and the rest have some vague, but passionate, pathways. I don't. I say I'm interested in certain subjects, which I was, but I have no clue what I want to do with them.
My lack of motivation has made it difficult to navigate my last year of school, and has been overwhelming at times. Especially with the prospect that everything I have done and studied leads me into a pathway I will forever despise and regret.
I feel like my friends and family will judge me if I tell them this, that I'll disappoint them, or they'll not take it seriously. I'm suppose to be the 'high-achiever' but my grades have been slipping, I can't concentrate in class and idk what I want to do in the future. Some days its hard to even get out of bed and I feel like every day is just another masquerade.
I'm just utterly and completely lost in life. I just was wondering if anyone could give me advice? I have no clue what I'm even asking but anything would be helpful.
Thank you.

Hello,

I have been struggling with depression and disassociation for a long time now. I have trouble identifying feelings and emotions. Been seeing a psychologist who has been helping me out with hypnosis therapy. Stuff actually works..

I have begun to disassociate less which I suppose it's good? But that means I am left dealing with all these emotions and feelings but I have not much idea of what they mean.

Anyways the one feeling that I am struggling with the most is a feeling of emotional pain that comes whenever I try to do anything. Example I like drawing.. if I decide that I want to draw I have the initial motivation to come up with the idea but as soon as I pick up a pencil or make a move I get crushed by this overwhelming emotional pain.


This happens when ever I try do something I 'like'... It seems the only thing I can do is lay down or sit still.

Has anyone else experienced something like this or have an idea of what I could do to get past this?

Hello all,

I have been suffering depression for years largely because I don't enjoy sex

This means I will be a lifetime single which isn't the be all and end all but it still feels awful.

Sex seems so fundamental to human happiness can I find a way to be fulfilled without it?

Any tips on how to stop dissociating? Last week my mum ignored me when I tried to help her understand my bpd more and then changed the topic. I got really angry and ever since I've been in an almost constant state of dissociation. I know that I need to feel my feelings, I need to feel real and be 'in touch' with myself and my surroundings, including people. But just now it scares me and feels safer to block everything. I have tried grounding, meditation, distraction (makes it worse). My counsellor suggested watching emotional/funny videos. I tried earlier and nothing... Wtf is wrong with me.... I also just found out I have a sensory processing disorder, so that is messing with me a bit too.Tia xx
Being like this is really bad for me, as I just bottle it all up and then explode at a later date. I can feel it roiling around waiting to ignite but I can't seem to let myself actually feel. It's like the walls are too strong.
C-PTSD/BPD/Anxiety/Depression/Sensory issues are kicking my butt right now. It's like I'm being smacked down smaller and smaller and once I'm squashed small enough I'll just splat everywhere. Or like I'm one of those watermelons that people put all the elastic bands around..... Nothing...nothing..nothing...nothing...nothing.........................BOOM.

I have BPD and have just been very down for 2 and a half weeks.  In that time I have self harmed.  I was obsessed with my appearance during that time.  Every time I looked in the mirror I wanted to self harm.  I am now not self harming and am feeling reasonably ok.  However I watch Netflix where all people are beautiful and it starts me obsessing about my appearance again.  My conversation is also mainly focused on that and it is naturally really annoying my friend.  Any suggestions from anyone?  Just as a final note I consider myself one of the ugliest people on the planet.  I am doing things to distract myself, but the later is always in the back of my mind.  If anyone is feeling like this now or has felt like this in the past please let me know and help me out somehow.

I‚Äôm trying to work, homeschool my autistic prep child, look after my 3 yr old who can‚Äôt attend childcare because my partner and I aren‚Äôt permitted workers. I have felt through all of this that I am doing a bad job at everything. I‚Äôm doing a bad job at work, I‚Äôm struggling to stay motivated in educating my child (and I‚Äôm a former teacher so this devastates me!), I‚Äôm grumpy with my three yr old even though she‚Äôs beautiful. I have no time left to love my partner properly even though he has been amazing in supporting me to get the help I need. I haven‚Äôt felt suicidal for a week or more (yay meds!) but today I‚Äôm struggling. I miss my friends, my family, my hobbies, my energy and myself. It would be nice to connect with others who found today disappointing, despite this lovely weather. I know things will get better but it seems so far away.

Isolation was so much better than this.
I moved in with my family at the beginning of this week when I got out of mandatory isolation and so far I've had to see my racist bigotted transphobic brother twice, my dad has called me a failure, ugly and stupid pretty much every day and keeps pressuring me like ""what are your plans what are you doing"" like, I got here 6 days ago, my stuff hasn't even arrived at the house yet, can you chill? I have just been in a house with abusive housmates for 2 years, and then spent half a year locked inside with them because of covid where the bullying escalated. I'm not ready, I have told him this, he laughed at me. I wore a mask to the shops and told me I looked like a *swear word* and laughed at me and basically bullied me for it. I'm just trying to feel comfortable and now I can't wear a mask anywhere because it makes me want to cry because of the things he said to me so now I have to be uncomfortable and unsafe. It's stupid. 
He is pressuring me to look for work when again, I literally just got here. Hell, I don't even have a windows computer to send my resume yet because again, my stuff isn't here yet. 
I am paying substantial rent, like not that much less than I was paying before, yet somehow my family can dictate what I have to do. I can't text while the TV is on, I can't stay in my room, I can't go out for lunch, I can't do anything. I feel trapped and I literally hate it here. 
I ran away from my family for a reason and the fact that lack of money is what brought me back is so crushing and my depression is perhaps worse than it has ever been. I'm lost and confused, and my family doesn't understand mental illness so they just think I am a lazy teenager and keep pushing and pushing and pushing and I'm already almost at my breaking point after literally 6 days.
I'm sick of being bullied, talked down on and pushed around literally everywhere I go. I just want to run away and move cities/countries but I don't have money. Money is the bane of my freaking existance. My brother and my dad are the same, they say biggotted borderline masoganistic shit to me as a ""joke"" but it's not funny and it's really hurtful and already makes me feel worse about myself than I already do, which I didn't think was possible.
I can't be here.....

Hi , Im a 50 yr old man with three great children, I have a long history of anxiety and depression and generally not doing well at life. My wife has decided she wants a separation but until we sell the house we cannot live separately. Since the initial separation 6 months ago covid19 has affected my employer and i was made redundant, we are still gaining final approval for building a workshop on our property before we can put the house on the market. My mother revealed  she was aware of the sexual abuse of my older sibling who perpetrated against myself when I was 10. Ive been reemployed because of the Jobkeeper financial support thankfully . I am experiencing  elevated levels of stress and anxiety that i have never experienced before and only just coping with my crisis. I have sought help through psychologists and psychiatrists and taking medication to manage my situation. I have no other support network. I look back on a life of waste and squandered opportunity and find little or no solace in anything . The problems in my marriage were not totally my fault but most of the responsibility falls at my feet. I have never felt so isolated and alone with no hope in all of my life. I feel i have nothing left   except my three children.

I was having a long distance relationship and 3 months 
in she started being different and ended up blocking 
me out of the blue for no reason. She told me later that 
she has had depression for several months and she got 
scared I might play her like all the other guys do. Since 
then she has just been different. There are times where 
she would push me away and not want to talk and tells 
me ""don't talk to me"" as if she is being a little aggressive/ 
upset. Sometimes she lies about things and the last 
month she has been lying about having a boyfriend. 

Recently she seemed more comfortable talking to me 
and opening up a little more so I decided to question her 
about this boyfriend she mentions occasionally. I knew it 
might not go well to tell her that the person doesn't exist. 
I don't know if she actually believes her own lie or not 
but she wouldn't admit anything instead she was saying 
goodnight trying to leave the conversation. 

Since that conversation she has been very different and 
has not wanted to talk to me and has been telling me 
that she needs some space and that she doesn't need 
anymore pressure on her. She used to be so close to me 
and seemed really happy to talk to me. 

She tells me now that she is not comfortable talking to 
me and to leave her alone. Is there something I can say 
to her to make her feel comfortable again? I guess for 
questioning her lies she pushes me away... I just want to 
be able to talk to her again.

Hi folks,
Well, I‚Äôve been MIA a while now. After my world fell completely apart, and every therapy offered to me through the system failed, I gave up seeking answers and threw myself into trying to build a new life. 

I‚Äôve bought myself a house, learned skills I never thought I could learn, reached out socially, created a fb group for a personal interest that‚Äôs grown to hundreds of members and benefits charities and have continued to work all the while. 
But my chronic illness has remained unchanged, I am still in constant pain and exhausted, medically unfit to drive, stuck in a low paid job because I‚Äôm not physically capable of more challenging work, and I‚Äôm not one tiny bit closer to the dreams I lost. My house does not feel like a home even after 3 years and lots of work trying to make it my own, because I live alone with my pets.
I feel like the life I have now is wrong for me, it‚Äôs not a bad life, I don‚Äôt mean to complain that I don‚Äôt have ‚Äúenough‚Äù, I‚Äôm not ungrateful. But it feels like it doesn‚Äôt fit me and it chafes and makes me hurt deeply all of the time. Yes there are moments of pleasure in little things, but that‚Äôs just a band aid and offers no healing. I hide the depression because I‚Äôm either not wanting to burden the people I love any more than they have suffered already, or I‚Äôve been told I should be over it by now (by people who have everything I‚Äôve ever wished for).
My question is, what do I do now? I‚Äôve run out of things I can think of to try. My younger self‚Äôs dreams were to have a career and travel the world with the love of my life. I can‚Äôt think of any new dreams that even come close to those shattered ones. The career is impossible, travel financially out of reach even without COVID and well, love, love isn‚Äôt for me. I also lost the home that I had put my heart and soul into when my health failed before my marriage failed too. 
Would welcome advice please and thank you. There must be a way to learn to live with this quiet desperation, even if I cannot escape it.
 Thank you

Hi everyone this is my first post,
I have suffered from anxiety and depression for probably 10 years now, 
last year I decided to seek help and I started on medication - it has been a huge help and made things feel more achievable and definitely taken the edge off of my anxiety and has made it more manageable.
however some days are worst than others and I find I still get burnt out rather easily - I work full time in retail and working during stage 4 restrictions is definitely taking a toll with the craziness and extra work we are doing every day. 
i have many down days and I feel as though lately my down days have been more often as I am isolated from a lot of friends and family 
I tried to talk to my mum about it but she doesn‚Äôt quite  understand depression and that I just can‚Äôt help but feel sad/lonely/anxious etc she sees it as a sort of ungratefulness 
I often feel guilty that I‚Äôm sad or feeling down because I have a good life and I‚Äôm lucky and I don‚Äôt want to be ungrateful for all of the good things I do have but I still have the down days and I still have the anxiety and loneliness 
I do a lot of things to try to keep ontop of my mental health ie) eating well, routine, good sleep schedule, getting 10k steps a day, etc
does anyone else feel this way?? Or maybe have some recommendations of things I could try to help?? 
thank you in advance

So after many years of struggling with depression, I have found some sort of respite in a mental health team that over  2 years have given me some sort of explanation for the strange highs and lows of my life. I‚Äôm glad they took the time for me. As a Psychology graduate, I insisted on a thought out diagnosis from at least 2 sources.
Bipolar type 2 (no surprise) 
Borderline Personality Disorder.
Amongst my peers and family dynamics, who have always described me as ‚Äòresilient‚Äô, It has come to a point recently that I could not deny that I cannot cope.
I could not front up and keep being the person who has generally, helped everybody else. So when I needed help, the resources where exhausted. 

I have joined this forum, as suggested by a patient team of said professionals, in the hope that I can find some people who understand what it means to be exhausted. How it feels to feel so absolutely alone, and sometimes really afraid. That  sometimes you can have a veneer of strength and yet be on the verge of suicide. 
And when you tell someone, it does not make sense.

Weekdays, I get up and make myself just presentable enough to drive my daughter to school, then drive home and close the front door on the world. Unless I have to get groceries or petrol, I don‚Äôt go out. I don‚Äôt talk to anyone. I don‚Äôt have any friends and barely talk to family members. If I am asked how I‚Äôm doing, I‚Äôll deflect until that line of questioning goes away. My parents (who are the main cause of my issues) do ask how I am but I don‚Äôt trust them to let them in my head. They‚Äôve mellowed a bit over the years but I don‚Äôt see them as emotionally healthy. I feel detached from everything, even from people on forums like this who have similar symptoms/experiences to me. So I ignore everything and live in a very small world.

I hate this and they aren‚Äôt thrilled about it either. This is a family member who has similar emotional problems to me but is able to work. I feel shame and guilt at having to rely on someone like this. Im a good mum with a great relationship with my daughter, by being far more aware of her needs and emotions and wanting her to be happy.

Hi all,
I'm wondering if there are other members on here following the financial news of the coronavirus recession, and its implications for the economy. All the economic evidence points to a severe and prolonged downturn, with high unemployment remaining for the foreseeable future (several years...). 
I'm really struggling to get motivated as I am now unemployed and living off savings, and I can't see any clear indication of the economy improving. I can't find much motivation to do anything economically productive, and am only coping by instigating a self-care regime that doesn't involved any 'work'. While this is working, it does not feel sustainable. 
How are people coping with this circumstance ?

I don't really know what I'm even doing here. I don't think I have depression. Tonight a physical health issue has gotten worse after months of improving and it hit me that everything I have strived to improve over the past 10 years has gotten me absolutely nowhere and has been completely pointless. I'm 30, I live alone in community housing, I clean schools at night, I have no kids or family. My mum died 7 years ago and my dad wants to spend all his time with his awful girlfriend. I'm poor with no good career prospects, I have a frustrating health issue and I see no point in trying to improve my life anymore. 10 years of failure is enough for me. What has hurt me so much tonight is that (Christian theme ahead) through all of these years I've tried to keep my spirits up by saying that at least I have God to love and talk to. Tonight I've realised I don't. I've been fooling myself, too afraid to admit I really do have nothing. God doesn't love me, he doesn't help, guide or encourage me. I don't feel his love or support. I doubt he even knows I exist. Maybe he doesn't exist himself. I've let go of the lie that was keeping me going. Now I see I have no real reason to live for any happiness. There is no point, there is no purpose, there is no reason. From now on I live only for the sake of the two cats beside me.

Asking this question in a search engine bought me to this website.
I dont think I am overly depressed at all and I dont mean this question in a suicidal way. What I mean by this is I dont wish to participate in society any more but I am quite happy to not be around people, to not interact and I am comfortable in my own company. 
The issue I am debating with myself about is financials and fairness. To not participate in society means not having a job or career and having to rely on another person to support me. Which I have. I realise not everybody is in this position and I am worrying if this is going to bring bad karma to me?

A little more about my reasons...I am not good around people. I give off a desperate aura begging to be loved. Or at least i used to. I got taken advantage of over and over throughout the years because I was weak and pathetic and forgiving. I'm not a likeable person. I suffer on and off with different levels of anxiety and depression and I cannot fake being normal. I've not managed to hold down any job for a long amount of time and often blank out under stress.
I dont trust people. 
I seem to attract people like my abusive parent and although i understand the psychology of why, It changes nothing. I still attract them.

I'm not close to any family member and past attempts have left me broken.
I do have one person who isn't exactly supportive of my decision but allows me to do so.
This is what I am struggling with. Relying on one person to take care of me when i am physically able to hold down a job and force myself to interact regardless of how painful and stressful any and every interaction is.
Am I selfish choosing this? Will I receive bad karma for living this way? I dont feel like I have any more attempts in me to live a relatively normal life but I dread there might be a day where I am forced to either do that or ask the government to help me which I would loathe to do.

Hey there, I have a problem where I cry over small things I know aren't normal to cry about. For example, today my parents told me they would make time to teach me how to drive. They said that at around 1PM we would go out and have a little drive around. I expected them to cancel on me and they did which resulted in me crying and over thinking about all the times they've disappointed me when it comes to spending quality time with me.
It's not just that though, there are other even stupider reasons I cry and when I DO cry it's literally heart wrenching sobs that I try to conceal when I'm in my room so no one hears me. I also have absolutely no motivation to do anything, I wont do anything unless someone is there with me because otherwise I just wont feel like doing it. I get very upset each time someone makes a mean comment (especially when I'm close with the person that makes said comments) and again sneak off to my room to *suprise* cry about it. 
I never talk about this to anyone because I know they won't take it seriously. I don't know what's wrong with me and I feel so confused and lost. This has been happening for at least 2 years but I haven't thought much about it until recently because it has become a daily thing now. I just want to feel like myself again.
Thank you so much for any help, I appreciate it a lot.

Hi guys,
This is my first post ever on beyondblue forums so I‚Äôm a bit nervous. I have clinically diagnosed major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder (and have been diagnosed since I was 14, now 20). I am on medication¬†for these conditions. I also have a psychologist who I speak to on the phone (due to COVID).
Whenever I feel my depressive episodes creeping up on me I feel lethargic and disinterested in everything (as I‚Äôm sure many of you relate to). I also have an extreme loss of appetite which I‚Äôm usually able to deal with but at the moment I have no desire for food whatsoever. The thought makes me feel sick and I am just not hungry. I cannot bring myself to eat anything at all.
Have any of you ever dealt with this and found a way to force food down without feeling sick? Are there any particular foods which you find help you during these periods? I‚Äôm just really lost and not sure what to do as this is the worst my appetite has ever been. I can still drink water and some fruit juice but no solid foods, it makes me gag and I just don‚Äôt feel hungry.
Any suggestions would be much appreciated.
Thank you.

Not too sure if this belongs in the depression forum, I‚Äôll try and make the back story brief. For 19 years I never experienced anxiety or anything like that, but a year ago my ex left me and it shattered me and put me in an awful constantly anxious and suicidal state. Since then I have found a new girlfriend and she is wonderful, we tend to fight a bit but I really care for this girl and she is one of the few things that make me feel truly happy. Problem is i have found that the previous break up has caused anxiety and insecurity and easy sadness to linger around me. Throughout my time with my girlfriend, any sort of fight and my own overthinking would trigger all these, but I‚Äôve been doing really well at working on them and toning them down and being more calm. 3 days ago my girlfriend and I had a big fight (the fault was on my end as I hurt her feelings) and it‚Äôs at the point where she is on the verge of leaving me. My problem is that I felt very neutral on the matter, as if I couldn‚Äôt comprehend I was about to be left. We tried talking and I was a complete robot, I couldn‚Äôt even try and show sad emotion or show that I cared for her. I know exactly how I feel about my gf and the situation and I know about all the emotions I have for her, but I can‚Äôt feel them at this point of time, I‚Äôm blocked from sadness, I don‚Äôt feel the screaming anxiety and pain I know I should feel. Before people say it, it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt care for this girl cause I truly do, but I can‚Äôt show for it at all right now. I can feel happiness right now, but it‚Äôs mostly just neutral, nothing really below that. Has anyone experienced this and have any idea on the matter and how I can fix it? As much as I don‚Äôt want to feel right now, I need to be able to show emotion again. I don‚Äôt want to just be a robot towards the one I love

I think a lot of what I am feeling now and the state I am in, has been caused due to work related stress. 
My department is the most undervalued out of all departments in the organisation yet the most knowledgeable and busiest. Even though I have been told I am lucky to have a job during this tough time, I question myself if that indeed true when I find myself in current state- wanting to be alone and wanting to cut everybody that‚Äôs close to me off but in fact, I want them to help me in whatever way possible to make me feel better. 
Anyway I just wanted to let it all out here because I don‚Äôt know if I could even share these feelings to my closer circle of people. I cannot stand them saying everything is going to be okay when I don‚Äôt see any helpful suggestions, if any from them. I have appreciated their kind words and being caring but now, it only triggers me to feel... kind of upset. 
Maybe they don‚Äôt know how to help me other than just telling me they are there to help if I ever needed but that‚Äôs what I hate about.. 
My friends and my boyfriend keeps telling me to reach out if I need help but I don‚Äôt see the points. They haven‚Äôt been in my shoe so they cannot understand what I am going through and their positivity bothers me. I am being very bitter and passive aggressive and my gp didn‚Äôt take this seriously when I last visited her asking for advice early this week. 
Inside my head, there are too many thoughts just fighting each other. The noises in my head are so noisy to the point I am getting physically symptoms like severe earache and headache. People say is it just a job but I take my career very seriously and not being able to control things in the business to make necessary changes over time broke me. 
My colleague and I both cried out of anger and frustration and every little task can now trigger me to get worked up and cry in a second. 
I need help but dont know what could help me.

Hi, I have been suffering from depression and anxiety for the last 20 years.  I have seen psychiatrists during this time and have been on medication on and off as well.  I found the medication was okay but then I would gain weight which then just added to my problem and made things worse so felt that while one thing may have been getting better, then I another problem would replace it being the weight gain.  The last psychiatrist I saw was a few years ago and she retired and so that was that.  I thought I would try to get better myself but for the last two years it is just getting worse and I just feel so alone now.  I live by myself.  I don't really have anyone to talk to, most of my friends over time have gotten married and were too busy and then I found that it was hard to keep close friends when single as I always felt left out and then eventually I found it hard to go out and then they finally disappeared.  My family don't really get it, they say they do but they are never there when I need to talk, I find it hard to talk to them about it, my siblings do not really support me, I find that as they're lives are going good, they are too busy to notice that I am struggling so I keep it all to myself.  I am just so lost and feel very isolated and just find the people around me are just not good people to talk to.  They will either say that may be I should go on medication or get out more but it is so difficult to go out when you're alone and have no one to rely on for that.  Sometimes I wish I could just go into another world and start over again which I know sounds weird but I just have lost faith and trust in people I don't even feel I can trust anyone to talk about this without them mentioning it to someone else.  I just really feel so stuck.

Hey!

Urgh, 32 recently. Had some 1on1 before with professionals but always found they were lacking.¬†

I've never had any ambitions in life, I'm very (woah insite into very!!! :O) lonely but from previous experience have shut myself off from others due to having being hurt by the 1 long term partner I had?

Dad died when I was still preteen (from memory).

Just looking for people to take to... looking for validation in existence I guess?

Have a staffy that is centre of my world. Dunno what to say or do. Just know I need to at least try?

Guess just looking for god or bad human contact?

I feel like my depression is winning completely at the moment. I can't stop thinking about ending it all, i don't want to, last thing I really want to do but I just don't see a way out anymore. Life is too hard, relationship is too messy and I can't fix anything. My family has come to stay for a few days, I'm scared after they leave that that will be it.

In my head I'm sorting out who I would leave money to, and who will be responsible for dealing with my leftovers after I go. That scares me, I've never made plans before. A psychologist told me my vitamin d might be low, pfft yeah something is low, that's me.

Hey!
Would just like to start by saying I'm very new to this - I've only been diagnosed/on medication for depression for about 3 weeks. 
My current problem is telling my parents - I'm 19 and I lied to them about where I was going when I initially went to my GP for a mental health care plan. I really need their support for what's to come - I can't keep up a facade when I start regularly seeing a psychologist - but am struggling to find the right time to open up to them and tell them I'm not doing well. 
I think it comes from mental health never being spoken about growing up and also just their judgement of my low moods and thinking I'm lazy when I lie in bed all the time, unable to get out. 
I want them to know there's a reason but I'm actually really worried about their response, just because I think it'll be really judgemental and not understanding.
I'm sure some of you have been in the same situation - how did you go about bringing it up? And should I prepare by gathering information about my condition? I know they have no understanding/concept of mental health issues - or maybe they just hide it really well? Honestly I'm just really confused.
I think that by not telling them it's like this barrier between me and booking an appointment with a psychologist and just getting better in general.
I totally recognise I'm lucky to have parents at all and I should just be honest but I think my anxiety is definitely stopping me. 
Thanks in advance for your help!

Hi there,
i recently lost my fur baby, Pippa after a brief illness. Pippa was 13 years old. I now felt so lost without her. Every minute in my home reminded me of Pippa. I am trying to adopt a rescue dog but since I am looking for a small, young dog, it is almost impossible to find one. If there is any for adoption, the asking adoption price is as much as paying, if not more than for a puppy that one can purchase from a pet shop. The rescue dog also comes with a huge list of criteria to fulfil. 
I am now thinking of stopping the search and just focus on my mental health.
Previously, when I felt down, I used to take a few weeks off to travel but with this pandemic crises, it just makes things difficult. So, I guess I am mourning for my lack of freedom as well.
Thank you for your support.

People don't understand. They don't understand that depression feels as though we just a recyclable plastic bottle. I'm made and filled with water, emotions, happiness, and then I am just cast out to the world. I sit on a shelf waiting for anyone to choose me. I watch as people come and go, glancing at me, noticing me, ignoring me.
Then when that one person shows up, they take me and pay for me, as if I were just something that could be traded away, like a piece in their own games. 
Who, exactly, buys the water bottles? People that need the water, the happiness. But not always. So the thirsty and the full take the water bottles, and slowly drain me from the happiness inside me. I watch as it all pours out, and yet, despite the pain this gives me. I let it happen. Because this is my purpose.
And when the thieves of my joy are satisfied, and I lay empty, they toss me. I am once again traded for money. Then they fill me with the water and joy from somewhere else, but whose happiness is this, I do not know as they force me to be 'happy' again. Even if I don't want to be. Whose joy did they steal? Just to continue my purpose and suffering? Well... nothing I can do about that.
So once again, I am thrown on the shelf, waiting, waiting for the next person to buy my happiness for themselves. This continued, never stopping, never taking a break. There were people that chugged my hope and joy as fast as possible. Some only took small sips, draining me as slowly and painfully as possible. There was even a person that poured my heart straight into the dirt, for their own amusement.
But after all that, I was content, because I was helping them, and they were letting me help. Not only that, but although they returned me to be filled back up, just to repeat this torturous cycle, it was better than me ending up in landfill. With all the others that were taken out of this cycle. I want to leave. But we all know how the plastic kills. So I must choose; live an eternity of pain and artificial, or leave and poison all around me. That is why, I am still content, I just need to last it out.
'Water is joy; but bottles are poison. Which sacrifice must be made?'

Hi, I work in a call centre which has been abusing JobKeeper by forcing us to work 10 hours more per week than pre-COVID days. It's also increased the monitoring and scrutiny on us all to 11! Every call we make is analysed and dissected to a ridiculous level. The Thursday before last we had a meeting with our bosses about the situation and everyone had their chance to say how undervalued, scrutinised and disgruntled we all felt. When it was my turn, all I could do was cry and I couldn't stop for almost an hour! I think it was the relief of finally hearing that I wasn't the only one feeling stressed. I saw my GP a couple of days later because I was still feeling extremely low, and he gave me a medical certificate for a week off, which ends tomorrow! The problem is that I don't feel any better at all. I‚Äôd like to quit but will struggle financially if I do, and at 53, I might not be able to find another job, as they are scarce in regional Australia. I can't take SSRIs anymore due to a very rare side effect which could leave me blind. I don't know what to do. My boss is not the sympathetic kind at all. I‚Äôm just so confused, suggestions and advice please!

So i was talking to someone, who said that were invading the country. And with social media, the news.
Im scared of the world and the current situation. 
I asked him if he was joking or being serious, cause talking like this scares me. 
He didn't reply. And said how old are you. 
So i have told him it scares me. What else can I do 
Am I not allowed to tell people how the current situation scares me?
Also I had an counsellor and she said I acted like a 6 or 7 years old. 
So i felt uncomfortable so I let her go. 
But because i also attend art class where the counsellor  knew the people who ran it.
Im becoming more paranoid  about going to art class. Which is making me feel uncomfortable  to go.
And its over the computer so its hard to express how you feel while everyone is listening.

Ha I'm going to blame Covid for some of my current depression but I know its not just that. My goal this year was to find consistent work to keep depression at bay. Ha that has taken time, I at least have an interview next week. The other thing volunteering has been stopped due to Covid but planning to put that in somewhere in my week once I have work or maybe before it but its second priority unless there are no jobs soon. Kept busy in other ways but I just think the brain likes consistency hah and its been a bit rocky this year. Who else is dealing with a flattening depression that feels like a fog/cement?

Sometime around 6 months ago after two months of straight talking, I went on a first date with the most perfect man, someone who gets me on every level, wants most of the same things in life as me, but especially on major issues (we both don‚Äôt want babies), we could not stop talking to each other, and we‚Äôre still like this even months into our relationship. He proposed to me 2 months in and we were in a bubble of happiness. His friends and family love me and we all get along really well. My friends who have met him love him too. Now I know from the start he was medicated for anxiety and seeing a therapist -  as I also have anxiety and depression and I‚Äôm medicated and have been through therapy, this was not a red flag for me as it gave us deeper understanding and love and support for one another. The issues in our relationship started when I woke up one night and he was crying because he had drunk bottles and bottles of high percentage alcohol. I thought this was weird because nothing in my mind had triggered it. He said he couldn‚Äôt sleep so he tried getting drunk to get to sleep. 
Fast forward about a week later, we‚Äôre at the local pub together and this girl starts flirting with him in front of me. The worst part is he starts flirting back. Not as in making a move on her but laughing at her jokes and being open to her advances, instead of rejecting them. After this I tell him to pack his things and get out, unwilling to listen to him, because knowing cheaters in my personal life, if they do it once they‚Äôll do it again. He was devastated and cried and begged me to forgive him. I eventually gave in and things were great for months. Once or twice a month he would binge drink heavily which concerned me but not enough to consider leaving. A week ago, he cheats on me by trying to text other woman asking them for sex and lying that he‚Äôs not engaged. I find out, I‚Äôm devastated, and he doesn‚Äôt seem to care. 12 hours later he comes to, and is devastated and is like I don‚Äôt know why I did that I don‚Äôt like anyone else i think I‚Äôm broken. We saw a psychiatrist and he diagnosed him with mild bipolar, and changed his medication warning us that his moods could change while adjusting. A few days after this, my usually beautiful, warm and affectionate fianc√© tells me to pack my shit and get out. He‚Äôs now living at his friends place and has told his friends he has no desire to get back with me. I‚Äôm devastated - we both believe we‚Äôre soulmates. Is there any hope for us?

Hi All,
First time posting so hope I do this right. Here we go..
Over the years I've encountered many issues at work due to my long standing experience with depression. I have quit several roles in order to escape the judgement/stigma and my own resulting downward thought spiral stemming off of that judgement/stigma. In general the issues I've had are to do with building/maintaining rapport with co-workers/bosses/authority figures and an inability to make work friends or even acquaintances. I've also repeatedly experienced what I'd call a mild level of chronic bullying. The bullying was subtle but humiliating and devastating. Whilst it certainly didn't feel very subtle at the time, on reflection I can see that I blew things up to clinical proportions in my own mind. I think the bullying may have occurred as co-workers may have interpreted my aloofness/weirdness as rudeness or rejection ( have recently reflected on my own behaviours with a psychologist to consider how I may be coming across to others and the negative/unfriendly/awkward cues I might be displaying etc). 
There's a fair bit to the history but essentially I'm wondering if anyone has come clean, so to speak, to their employer or co-workers regarding depression. How did you go about doing this, what was the reaction from others and what was the long term result for you ie: did people leave you alone once they finally understood that you have a medical condition.
I feel that to come out of the mental health closet may be the only way to make my work day emotionally manageable and continue with my right to earn an income. Just have no idea how to casually do this if it can be done.
Any input is greatly appreciated.
Thanks

Hi all.. I've been going through depression for a few weeks now and I'm not liking any of it, I've struggled at and have nobody to express my feelings to because when I do, I either get over it or just keep it bubbled up.. I hate myself for some reason and super jealous of my partner which has been hard for me to get over ever since he cheated I have no trust. I've been crying myself to sleep due to over thinking and thinking my looks are not all pretty. Some days I just want to lay in bed and cry, most days I walk around with a smile but end up hiding my tears. I need help even when I've helped a lot, I've been left in the dark with my crazy thoughts and just wanna die,just so I don't have to feel any pain....

Hi , 
I was diagnosed with bi polar , PTSD and depression years ago.I have had depression since i was 16. However I have noticed in the last two years it is getting worst. 2018 was the year a psychiatrist diagnosed my with bipolar.
So days i feel really at peace with my self and only have certain maniac episodes. I do enjoy the maniac moments because i feel like i have so much fun . I know they are not great to have, because typically i have a massive meltdown the next few days THEY ARE THE HARDEST because all i think about is suicide. I know I wont do it, well i think i wont , but a big part of me wants to. 
In 2018 I lost my pop, and then last year my nan. They were practically my parents, I then had my relationship end this year after almost 3 yrs. I feel i have blocked everything out atm and feel insanely numb about everything. I have started seeking help, however I feel they just don't listen and they just want to pump more pills down my throat. I sometimes wonder if this is my life forever. That the thoughts in my head wont ever go away. 
I guess what I am asking is there alot of Bi polar people out there that go through the same mood swings. One day your on top of the world, the next you hate everyone and everything., does it ever get easier .. will the numbness ever fade. Do i need to see a different shrink ? what meds are other people on ?
 
thank you .

Hi I posted much of this in the newbie thread but I would like to seek a wider audience.
I am 49, married (second time around) with two kids from my first marriage, and a five year old from my second. I am a career public servant at upper middle level, and I have had battles with depression and anxiety since my early 20s. Right now I'm going through (yet another) severe bout of depression. I appreciate we shouldn't post too much personal detail here but context is important.
I'm actually on leave on half pay all of 2020. After many years of stress at work I decided to take this year to be a stay at home dad and help my youngest with their first year of school. Things haven't gone quite to plan with COVID etc but that's unavoidable.
Now I am at home and at least not stressed by work but I am depressed as ever. I am very fortunate and have no major problems but I can't seem to shake it. I've tried two different medications over the years but mostly I feel the side-effects are worse than any possible benefits. I have finally weaned off the second of these with much difficulty.
I feel hopeless ... everything is poisoned by the depression. Halfway through my leave and I am already starting to stress about returning to work. Long hours and high stress are part of the deal and my family has suffered over the years. I saw little of my older two children when they were younger because I was always at work. I don't want - and my wife definitely doesn't want - me to return to that habit.
But at home not working I haven't found the peace and joy I was seeking. The depression never leaves and I am ... so... tired... of fighting every single day. I wake up and it punches me in the face. I am not suicidal but I do have thoughts about it being the only way to stop the pain. I have quit drinking because I did come close once last year on a work trip - after a lot of drinks I found myself on a high balcony and considered doing it.
I do have professional help and have a psych I have seen for many years. She is good but no one else in my life understands the pain. My wife cares but doesn't know how to help, and I feel that it is slowly destroying our relationship. I have no real friends left - no one wants to be around depressed people. I feel hopeless- I see no way out and I can't see any options that will make things better.
So here I am - hoping to talk to people that understand depression and won't just tell me to cheer up and move on. Thanks for listening.

Hi, I‚Äôm Russ, I have battled depression and anxiety since a teeneager and still now at the age of 41 find it hard to find a happy memory. I‚Äôve tried many antidepressants and have had tms and currently on an antidepressant plus a benzodiazepine¬†and muscle relaxer for the anxiety. I‚Äôve tried everything in life from a extreme fitness to alcohol abuse to big holidays, expensive cars what ever I though would make me happy, I‚Äôve had relationships but feel my inner demons end up subconsciously destroying them. I‚Äôm high functioning but dam the lows are low and harder to control especially after a recent break up. I have never written on any of these things before but I‚Äôm lost, I‚Äôm so very lost and tired of the fight and putting on the happy face. I‚Äôm afraid to die but I‚Äôm afraid not to as I believe someday it will get better but I always feel like I‚Äôm just out of reach of happiness and then it grabs me and drags me back into the abyss, and that‚Äôs a scary place cause each time the fight to get out takes a little more of your soul.

I am currently still in hotel isolation (day 7 of 14).
I did some looking for places to live tonight because my family is already making me feel like a burden and setting rediculous rules for me just so they can control me and my movements like I did when I was a child, and I haven't even moved in yet! I found some really cute places, so naturally I looked for jobs in those places. Nothing. Then I looked for work in the whole state. Nothing.
Every single job requires experience of 2 or more years, which I don't have, plus I can't get experience because noone will hire me because I don't have experience and I get stuck in a loop. I won't be able to get a place to live without a job, even though I would only move into a place where my financial benefits from the government would easily cover it and I would be able to survive, landlords don't care about that and only look at job income, when there is none, you don't get approved which is stupid but anyway, that's an issue for another day. I hate that the world has become who do you know ratehr than actually looking at qualifications and working with people, expanding your horizons ect.
I am starting to get pains in my legs from the lack of exercise and walking. I tried to do stretches today but I don't want to do too much because I don't want to disturb the person below me, and the balcony is locked so I actually can't do literally anything.
I don't want to move in with my family, I still haven't got my bond back from my abusive ex-housemates (I wasn't on the lease so it should have been given back to me immediately but again, abusive. They are being difficult for the sake of being difficult), I feel tired and lonely and I just want to be able to survive without all this stress and stuff in my life. Housing is a basic human right, the fact I cannot get it even when I can afford it is a joke. 
I have plenty to do in isolation so its not so much that that's bothering me, I just... idk. I wish I could live and survive but I am socially autistic and struggle to make friends, therefore no connections, therefore the world tells me I'm not allowed to survive. All my friends are international and different time zones, which isn't helping. One of my closest friends has health issues and isn't online so I can't even check and see how he is. Life just sucks.

I‚Äôll try to describe the situation and keep it short and concise. I apologise if I have broken any rules.
My brother has been battling depression/mental health from the age of 17 (as to what I can tell). He is now 34.
He was a talented, popular, life of the party, good looking bloke, a ‚Äònatural‚Äô at all board sports and a great musician.
He finished high school at the age of 17 then completed a 4 year Electrical apprenticeship.
Toward the end of the apprenticeship the early signs of low self esteem were beginning.
Always doubting himself, asking family members if he 'was an idiot' or 'sounded like a dickhead‚Äô.
He completed the apprenticeship but has not worked since the age of 21. 13 years now.
Lives with my parents in the same bedroom he grew up in.
He daily routine is this: sleep until 5pm, drink 1 litre of coffee, go back to his room, closed the door, closed the blinds. Once complete darkness, he takes the family dogs for a walk for 1 hour. Sometimes taking a skateboard with him. Then eats dinner that my mother cooks by himself in his room.
He has a tablet with wifi. But other than that I cannot get into the room (he locks it) to see what else it in there.
He never goes out in public. He rarely talks to my parents.
I feel like my parents are ‚Äúenabling‚Äù him to continue this down this path.
They feel that he is going to ‚Äúsnap out of it‚Äù one day and that is all that can be done. They provide him kind of healthy food, fuel, a car and free rent.
He is incredibly skinny almost malnourished.
He rarely talks to me.
I have been to multiple mental health facilities here in Australia over the years to see what can be done. I have been told that unless he is physically hurting himself or others there is legally nothing that I can do.
I feel it has been long enough and some drastic change has to occur, eg get the men in the white coats to forcibly remove him to a mental health facitliy. Whether or not that is a good idea, I am not sure.
I have been living in a different city and overseas, but try to visit as much as I can.
Has anyone else been in this situation and is there anything I can do to help?
Thank you in advance, I hope all is well. T

Hi, 
I live in a small rural country Qld town. I‚Äôm 38 and have worked at the same job for 25 years. I don‚Äôt enjoy the job anymore. It‚Äôs not me. I don‚Äôt enjoy my fellow work colleagues company anymore, I just feel like I don‚Äôt fit in. Manager under the boss in my office, who I work with the managers wife. She had only been there 5 years, thinks she knows everything and gets the royal treatment because of her husband being the boss. She is also very negative and only talks negative to me. She will even ignore me in the office, like I don‚Äôt exist, plus repeats everything ever I‚Äôve says. My other work colleague has been there 20+ years and knows everything and is the centre of attention. She gets all the praise for all the effort I do behind the scenes. Plus she also tells the boss that I make mistakes all the time and am hopeless at the job. 
so currently the whole office gets along, except me, as I‚Äôm over the drama and being accused of doing things wrong all the time. Which I have defended in the past, but after 15 years, I would have thought I wouldn‚Äôt have had to defend the job I do, so I don‚Äôt anymore.
 
we are currently going through a whole new workplace computer system, so all learning something new, with very little training. I‚Äôm the youngest in the office and would have thought I should be picking up, however I am not. I‚Äôm slowly losing control and hating my office job more and more every day, 
The boss pulled me aside on Friday and wasn‚Äôt nasty and I actually can‚Äôt remember what exactly was said, but something along the lines of - I need to be more supportive in the office of my work colleagues, as they have worked very hard and worked some very long hours to ensure the company is still running. They were asked to work longer hours - 15 hour days for the week, plus a Saturday shift as well, all overtime, they also enjoy starting work at 5am, whereas I usually start at 8 and finish at 4. I‚Äôm on salary also, where as they are on wage & overtime. 
I get the impression I‚Äôm getting pushed out the door. Which this is ok, as I don‚Äôt want to be there, however I would like another job to go to. During these trying times, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs easy. 
Thank you for your time. It‚Äôs just nice to get it off my chest.

Hi, I‚Äôm S. In 2018 I got diagnosed with depression after walking out of class crying and asking my dad to pick me up, he suggested that we go to the medical centre, he didn‚Äôt know what was wrong. I privately asked for a depression test and I got diagnosed.
After getting diagnosed I got put on medication¬†and I continued to get prescriptions till the end of 2018/early 2019 when I suddenly decided to stop taking it because it wasn‚Äôt working for me, it didn‚Äôt make me feel any better and I felt like less of a person. I went to one session with a therapist and another with a psychologist but I felt too embarrassed to go back because my mum was with me both times and I was so ashamed. Near the end of 2019 (November maybe?) I woke up one day feeling little to no emotion and it was a shock. Up until that point all I felt was this heavy weight on my chest like my body was logged with water and there was only underlying sadness but I woke up empty.
I‚Äôve been like that ever since, I can barely feel emotions and it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre behind this wall. Sometimes I feel a flash of anger and then it‚Äôs gone in the next second because I realise it‚Äôs pointless to get angry, I still feel the constant sad and dull feeling but it‚Äôs more in the background and I mostly feel empty. I think I suffer from emotional detachment. In the past few days I‚Äôve been getting worse, I thought I‚Äôd been coping well but it‚Äôs like this wave of depression has knocked me off my feet. I know that I need medication (probably a different kind), I know that I need a therapist or psychologist but I‚Äôm too ashamed to ask my mum. All these problems that I have and all that‚Äôs stopping me is disappointing my mum because I‚Äôm too embarrassed of my own depression even though it runs heavily in her side of the family. Everyone around me acts like I‚Äôm fine but I‚Äôm not, there‚Äôs always this inner turmoil happening and I can smile and laugh but it doesn‚Äôt feel real. I can feel the humour in the joke and think it‚Äôs funny and get it but I don‚Äôt feel happiness when I laugh. I feel comfort with my friends but not happiness. I feel like my parents forgot that I have depression and that they think it‚Äôs probably ‚Äúgone away‚Äù in some sense but it hasn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know what to do but I know that I need help. What do I do?

First time posting here. English is not my native language, so hopefully what I'm about to say makes sense.
I have been in Australia for over 10 years, going to uni first and then settled down to work. Met my lovely wife at uni and got married 5 years ago.

I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression when I was 12, and experienced many ups and downs but never really been properly treated until moving to Australia.

Uni was relatively smooth sailing apart from one depressive episode that I came out of after a few months, without treatment. Working life is a lot more bumpy, with increasingly frequent episodes.
Almost every time, my depression was triggered by work, usually by a new job. Then I had to quit the job because I just couldn't handle the debilitating and paralysing feeling it brought. The depression goes away after a few months, with the help of antidepressants and talk therapy.

After 3-4 episodes during my not-so-long professional life, it was triggered again a few months ago by a new job. I just couldn't accept the fact that it's back again and again like groundhog day. I feel so hopeless that I ended up in hospital for 2 weeks. The hospital environment was not very ideal and I was discharged because I was deemed stable. Quite a relief for me because I felt extremely uncomfortable in the ward and I couldn't manage to sleep much at night.

I started to feel better after the discharge and went back to the job part time, only to realise that I just can't handle it, even though the team was very supportive and flexible to accommodate me. The nature of the job just made me anxious and unable to focus, think clearly and feeling nauseous the whole time. I resigned AGAIN.

I'm such a failure! My career hasn't progressed much over the years, and now I end up with yet another gap to explain to future employer. I just can't do this any more! I even contemplate changing career, but wouldn't that be another escape? Plus, with my current state of mind, I can't think of anything I'd like to do anyway...
I have a supportive partner, a good GP and psychologist. I know I tick all the boxes for depression and anxiety, but I sometimes think I'm just using them as an excuse to by lazy.

Sorry for the rambling. Already reaching the limit but I have a few more paragraphs to add ...

Hi all,
I'm currently in lockdown in Vic. I've lived with depression (and anxiety when things get bad) most of my life. It's been a tough year and I've had some really really low points, but I think I'm doing ok, considering. I meditate, try to move and try to make sure I reach out to people (I live alone).  Even on 'good' days though, my dreams are terrible.  I've always tended to bad dreams (it's often a first sign of depression getting bad). 
I started keeping a dream journal just to figure out why I wake up feeling awful and I've realised this is happening every night right now.
It's really wearing me down.  I get to sleep ok, and I wind down before bed.  But every morning I wake up with a brain full of stress, from fighting, screaming, being lost, being chased - you name it.  No matter how ok my day has been or if I've managed to walk, and meditate and do the right things it all comes out at night (and usually early morning just before I wake up).
It's making it impossible to get going in the morning - I lie there trying to calm down, to process and remember the grief/fear/etc was in a dream. I lie there and name everything in my room to try to ground. It's just hard enough to get through the day and I feel like I'm starting so far behind.
It doesn't seem to matter - I have a day of exercise, meditate, eat well - bad dreams. I have chips and wine for dinner and binge netflix curled under my doona - bad dreams.  My subconscious is not giving me a break and it's hurting.
Just reaching out to see if anyone has any insight or advice to help get through this, because it's really getting to me.
Thanks for being there and my care and support to everyone out there,
Tired in Melbs.

Hi all, this is my first post here so sorry if it's a lot
Over this year I have been battling with severe anxiety, from around March. when it first started, I would get the occasional panic attack, which started with everything feeling like it was slowing down, a tightening in my chest, then my heart quickly racing and I would run down the stairs thinking I was going to die, and that I could no longer control my body and such.
Last month it reached it's worse, I had gone on a long string of feeling normal again, if not happier than I was, since I thought I beat my anxiety or something similar to that. However then I started getting numerous panic attacks one night, I couldn't sleep and my anxiety was at it's worst it has ever been, I ended up not sleeping properly for a week, not moving much and constantly slipping into a panic attack whenever I had to get up.
That's when I realized that what I was doing to suppress my anxiety was no longer working, and that I had to change my approach otherwise I would constantly feel like this. Due to that, I have changed a lot over the past month, I decided to seek help through my parents/grandparents, I started seeing a doctor regarding my anxiety, and am seeing the same doc each week to check up on me to see how I'm going. I have been diagnosed with GAD, and I've been referred to headspace to start seeing a therapist. I'm a little worried, but I know it'll work out in the end.
However until recently, I've started to feel like everything is a constant lucid dream, and that nothing is real and I'm only floating through life. Due to that, it feels like I'm numb to emotions, when looking at myself it feel like I'm staring in a void. When I spoke to the doctor about it, he said it's called depersonalization and that many people with anxiety feel that way from time to time. Which has made feel a bit better about it, knowing that I can relate to people, however I feel like I constantly feel that way, even though my anxiety isn't bad at that point in time.
I feel empty, it feels like I'm starting to lose it mentally, I'm thankful to myself for my improvement, however I just don't feel happy anymore and I feel like it's only getting worse to the point where I won't ever feel normal again.
I like talking like this, but lately whenever I talk about things like my anxiety, or how I'm feeling, I can't help but feel guilty and sad about it.
Thank you and hope you are all doing well!
-Anthony

I‚Äôm in mid 20s and pregnant with my 1st child. I moved here a year ago alone with no fam/friends here. I am numb or not myself. I just seem to block everything or I just switch off the emotions like a weird ‚Äòno feeling‚Äô autopilot I now live in, without even trying. This baby was unplanned. I was not sad at first but now I constantly feel the pressure of not being ready and that I am going through this on my own. I don‚Äôt live with my partner and to be honest I am not sure we will stay together. He hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong I am now no longer intimate and have lost my feeling of connection and love. He is mostly supportive. He can say things lately with good intentions but I take it as I am not good enough and I know he doesn‚Äôt understand unintentionally he has added to my own feeling of worthlessness. I wish he could understand my feelings. I used to be able to manage stress, I now no longer seem to be coping and I don‚Äôt even really care that I‚Äôm not, I have accepted I am in a bad place. I cry and worry a lot about not being ready/prepared to be a mum. At one point I was ready to give baby up because of how useless I feel. I couldn‚Äôt. I feel like a terrible person for considering it but going through this on my own is scary for me. Im in my 2nd trimester. I have a lot of anxiety and am socially withdrawn now. I clean a lot now I think to avoid myself but I don‚Äôt know. I have thoughts of just disappearing and wishing I wasn‚Äôt in this situation or any, I would just like to not exist as it is exhausting. Everything I do now feels like an exhausting battle and Im too tired to fight. My usual positive outlook is gone. I normally do not dwell and I dislike self pity and I can not bring myself to call a councillor because I have a lot of social anxiety about talking to strangers. I feel worthless and almost no emotions about being pregnant. I feel crazy or like a robot. I have not felt happy about anything for weeks now just coasting life like I am not even me anymore. I wake up throughout the night and I am constantly hearing noises that feel real but looking out my window nothing‚Äôs there or no one else hears them. I use to feel full of life and the world was my oyster, now I don‚Äôt feel much at all. I think I needed to let this out and I wish reading it over I felt something, but I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know what is next for me. I won‚Äôt seek help, I can not do it. I am not worried about myself. Just want some peace.

Iam 43. A professional. I have a family.
i have had periods of depression and anxiety in my past- have always overcome it...but lately I have been waking up feeling this overwhelming sadness. No other way to describe it. Not about anything in particular, just sad...and it can last all day.
i have had a rough few years with normal teenage drama, that brought up some old buried trauma, then my husband semi-cheated, and I changed jobs to something I thought I‚Äôd live but am actually hating. A lifetime goal and it‚Äôs shit.
and I feel stuck becoming less confident as the days go on, wondering what the hell is wrong with me and wondering if I‚Äôm going to end up a weird hermit old lady. And then it all
becomes too much energy to think about and I fall deeper into this pit of sad can‚Äôt be stuffed-ism or other end and I just hate everyone.
so....what‚Äôs wrong with me? And how do I stop it.
and no, this is not something I would talk to people I know about because it‚Äôs a drag and they don‚Äôt need to hear my negative crap.

I am in Victoria, pregnant and due in November and I feel like the biggest loser on the planet at the moment because I'm pregnant...in the middle of a pandemic. Remote learning is the biggest load of bull donkey.
 I have seen in my life.

People in my life know I'm not coping. I reach out and crickets.
My daughter's school doesn't care that I'm struggling with remote learning.
I am refusing my prenatal appointments because I know if I catch this stupid virus they will separate me and the baby. I would rather die in childbirth than risk that. At least I'll get to see my baby before I die, I won't if I catch COVID.
Hospital is harassing me even though I have explained why I won't go...so I blocked their number. 
I feel nothing but guilt for being pregnant, I don't even know what the future is going to be like for my kids, at the moment the world is a rotten place to be!

I left my mother's group because they were all celebrating their pregnancies. I couldn't and I still can't. This isn't a good thing, and I didn't want to rain on their parade. 

I can't tell if I am depressed, disillusioned or just angry. I really hope all these sacrifices are worth it for those who need it, because it's not for me! I did therapy last year to help my social anxiety and agoraphobia. It is back with a vengeance but now I know I'm not being paranoid, people are definitely NOT trust worthy!

Hello,
I am not in a very good place, particularly right now - I ride between Anxiety and Depression regularly, self-helping with the anxiety has been helping although I still have a ways to go, but recently the Depression has hit me again hard. My primary thoughts revolve around life purpose, and kids... I am mid thirties now, but don't know what to do.
Most people around me are having kids, and I know my husband wants a child but I don't think I had ever really wanted them (deep down I thought I would just suddenly turn all clucky over children and want one, but if anything I think I have gone the other way!) I don't enjoy being around kids, I don't like holding kids, I get irritated by them very quickly and usually just get away as fast as I can...
I have really tried to want to have kids, really tried to think about life (with or without kids) and I am utterly lost... I am quite sick of hearing ""it's different when they are your own"" (which may be true) but it doesn't help at all to keep hearing it - just makes me feel like a damaged/broken female because I don't want babies.
Aside from my strong family history of Depression (quite severe) and other medical conditions, I can barely keep myself above the water, so how would I be able to cope with a child? Aside from being terrified of the actual pregnancy and birth process, it is not something you can change your mind about half way through, at the end you have a dependant, for life. 
I know I'm stewing on scenarios that haven't even happened, but I'm scared I will panic... I practically panic just thinking about it, the life changes involved, being stuck at home (if COVID-like situations return in the future), etc.
I don't want to have one for the wrong reasons (as I don't know what my mental state would be like, given that I don't want to and see no joy in it) but I feel the pressure, particularly from my husbands family, which is again the wrong reason.
I don't know what I am asking here, it just feels like a rant. I wonder if any other women feel the same? 
Would the stress actually impact the health of a baby if we tried?? I suspect it can't be healthy...
I have to pretend I am never going to have kids to just get through the days when the pressure feels intense, or my worrying and stress brings on horrendous migraines/headaches. I love my pets, love my hobbies, love my husband - but I can't seem to mentally cope with the idea of having a child...
Thanks for reading

I was very close with a girl having a long distance relationship. 3 Months into the relationship she changed one day and wasn't enthusiastic to talk to me, and started to lie about stuff. She then said we can't be together anymore and doesn't want to be attached to someone she can't have. The next day she got back to being close with me. A few days later I woke up to find she had removed me off her socials. I messaged her and she said she is trying to hide from me and said she has depression and has been in pain for 6 months. She told me that she will be going to hospital for a month and that I won't be able to contact her. She however stayed in contact with me while she was in hospital. She said she would be allowed to go out once a week. So she went out of the Saturday however she was going to school, home and back to the hospital - She seemed to be going out lot while in hospital. A couple days after being in hospital she got out but she didn't even tell me. I asked her why she isn't going to the hospital tonight and she said she's out. She added me back on the socials after being out however she was not the same as she didn't want to Snapchat me even though she still used it. We used to snap eachother every day and night. I thought this was strange.
There were moments were she wouldn‚Äôt seem enthusiastic to talk to me and we would sometimes have arguments, I would try keep it calm but she got to upset with me. She ended up blocking me a few times. We ended up agreeing to just be friends and a few days of not talking as much and her not showing much enthusiasm to talk to me, she wanted to be close with me again. She did this another one or two times.
Recently out of nowhere she said she is with a guy. Then one day she said she was at the guy‚Äôs house however she was clearly at her house (she was snapping me and I could see) She lied about being at his house. She lied about this guy as a whole. She keeps telling me about this guy she spends time with however he doesn‚Äôt exist. I am not sure why she would be making all these lies up. I feel like I am talking to a completely different person. I have tried to keep it cool and calm. I just don‚Äôt know why she has been so different towards me. I remind her that I am always there for her and she means a lot to me and that I care about her. When she was in hospital she said ‚ÄúI need you to be here for me‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in so much pain‚Äù,  I was there for her and she knows I was there, why is she being like this to me?

Gday, I‚Äôm new to this so forgive me if I am posting in the wrong place!
im not really sure what to say... I‚Äôm not sure why I feel the way I do! 
I have trouble making real friends, lost of people I know, but no one that I would say is a close friend. I can go months without anyone making contact to just say hi or see what I‚Äôm up to. I have reached out, joined groups and really tried to establish friendships... I get really lonely even though  I am surrounded by people every day.

Hi, 
I am a recovering addict, that has been diagnosed with BPD, GAD, PTSD and Depression. I wasnt an every day user but I couldnt drink/go out without it, and I would crave it on weekends, a bit of fun turned into a coping mechanism. My addiction started to cause relationship problems so I am working my butt off to stay away from triggers. I am on day 17. But now I have realized since the substances are eliminated, I am now impulsively shopping, yesterday I spent over $400 on shoes and gifts to get that rush. (being stuck at home isnt helping, it seems shopping is all i can do) 
I feel like i am bouncing from one addiction to another!  
Any suggestions to curb cravings to get a superficial high?

Hi guys, name's Josh. I'm 25 years old, a boxer and a trades assistant (CNC machining) and have been going through a hellish period of my life. I have Bipolar Disorder (1)  I'm medicated, on 3 types of medications! can you believe that? and I'm just going through the darkest period, have been for nearly all my life. Been like this for a week now, just crying constantly and sleeping all day (well it comes in moods and things that trigger me to be like this). I have a son, Hayden, he is the most gorgeous lil man you'll ever see, he is 2. Lil' blue eyes and blonde hair looks like his pappy, and a terror! Problem is, im fighting for my access to him in the family courts..  My (well no ex partner) left me, found someone else right quick. During the Dispute Resolution conference that happened recently, my ex had said her partner was there being the '' father figure '' for my son ever since he was 5 months old and bestows the title of '' step father '' she isnt even married. I missed out on my sons best milestones (any first time father will want to experience) I missed him walking and talking. Somedays, I just cant take it. I'm crying as i type this and im so sorry, i just want someone to talk to.
 
The courts are favoring the mother, I see my son very rarely. My lawyer has my pychs letter saying what I have and the medications im on is it true that the magistrate will use this against me?, but he knows im dad! thats great I do skype calls with him I just lose it when he says '' bye daddy '' I go, trying to hold the tears '' Bye little guy, i love you so much '', but I'm just so angry! I cant swear here but the frustration, my disorder.. Someone help me please? I need someone to talk to :(

I am married to an amazing man. We have been together 20 years, married for 15 and have 2 amazing daughters.  We have always stood by each other, and he has always been loving and supportive.
Towards the end of last year, my husband told me he was depressed. At that time, I asked him to get help. He said he didn't want to and we left it at that and things got better for a few months. But for the most part of this year things have been very up and down,. A couple of weeks ago he admitted that he wanted to die.
I know nothing about depression so every time we talk about it, I ask him to get help. However over the last few weeks he has stopped talking to me, and started sleeping in our spare room. He has told me that I can't help him, he wants to go it alone, I haven't been there for him, and may other hurtful things. I keep telling myself that it is the depression, but it causes me great pain and sadness.
Last week one of his oldest friends contacted me to tell me that my husband had been to see him. He told him he's lost and disconnected, doesn't know where he is, and how or where I stand with him. But his friend told me that he loves me, and that I can't give up, even when/if my husband says he has. He hasn't given up. But I need to be patient and try to find a way to reconnect. I cry every time I think of this.
I do believe there is still love there. But I can also appreciate that the depression probably leave very little room for him to feel/see anything else right now.
I know the priority is to get him help. However as he keeps refusing, I feel there is little more that I can do.
 I know he needs professional help and as long as I still have the strength to, I will keep trying to convince him to get help.
I am writing this post basically because I need hope. I need to know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. I need to know that loving him and simply being there for him (even though he says it's not enough) can get us through this. So if anyone has any experience, stories to share, tips and suggestions on how to reconnect,  I would be very grateful.
I know that it sounds highly idealistic, and we don't live in fairy tales. But I have to keep believing that we will get through this somehow.

Hi - I'm not sure if this is the right place, it didn't seem to belong in the coping with coronavirus thread, and I do have bipolar disorder...
I have a respiratory condition called gustatory rhinitis. All that means is that if I eat / drink, I can get a runny nose. 
What that means, is that in coronaland, I am a leper. So many places ask 'do you have a cough, cold, runny nose...' etc - and if you have one, they tell you to not come in / leave. I also have medication-induced sedation. Fatigue. Medication side-effect. Like my gustatory rhinitis runny nose, I've had it for years. I went to my health insurance office this morning. Sign on the door: if you have cough, cold, or FATIGUE... don't come in. Another place that considers me a leper. A pariah. For having a medication side effect. 
Last time I went to my GPs office, I walked in the door and was handed a piece of paper by the receptionst. If you have a cough, cold etc go outside and ring reception from outside. I went outside, and had to wait in the cold and wind (it was late afternoon and raining) until the GP came outside and told me I could bring my occasionally-runny-nose inside. That's going to happen every time I go to the GP.
Tafe SA says 'If you are unwell for ANY reason don't come to campus'. Any unwellness, stay home. So if you've got a migraine, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, a sprained ankle... stay home. No education for you.
Last time I saw my psychiatrist, I got asked cough/cold questions... but they left out the runny nose! Hooray! They let me into the waiting room. Ironically, I see him at the psychiatry clinic of the local public hospital. I vented to him about my frustration about being treated like a pariah for my gustatory rhinitis and fatigue, and he said he didn't have a problem if I answered no to those questions. He said that only new-onset cold-and-flu symptoms were a virus concern, that chronic respiratory symptoms even were not a coronavirus risk. I'm not a risk. He's telling me lying is okay. That was the expert opinion of the clinical director of the inpatient psych unit at a teaching hospital. 
Corona is used as an excuse to discriminate against sick people. People with chronic illnesses, even mild virtually-non-existent-ones like mine are treated like lepers.  Public health policy actively discriminates against chronically sick people for no good reason. 
Being discriminated against causes me anxiety and distress. I'm told to go away. For the forseeable future.

I'm living proof its not. Never had a really full time job. Kicked out of school in year 9 because I was too dumb. Got physically and¬† sexually assaulted as a kid by other kids. Get denied from every job because they secretly discriminate, though I don't blame them why hire someone who has a disorder over someone who is normal? Everyone thinks you're retarded. Like honestly whats the point in living with a learning disorder? Even worse I heard dating sites such as tinder had in the past banned people with disabilities. Whats worse is you grow up thinking you can be whatever you want, only that was never a realistic thing. Had a girlfriend in highschool who dumped me because she thought I was too dopey though she said I was cool at the same time. Then you get to your 20's and the anxiety/depression starts but what I really worry about is the disorder itself. Its like a bad song playing in my head. Just obsess over it all day every day for the past 15+ years. No one cares about people with learning disorders and those that seem they do just pretend they do.

I‚Äôve been struggling for weeks and have been avoiding hospital at all costs but with my depression and bpd getting harder and harder to manage I need 24/7 monitored support. 2 years ago I had an admission that started in a PAPU Ward, now due to COVID-19 I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed on how to start the process of a short stay. I have no family due to my mum being in Queensland and myself located in Melbourne, my best friend has been my ‚Äòcaretaker/support‚Äô the past few weeks but we both believe I need to be in a more safe and secure environment getting treatment from professionals.

Hi,
Whenever I find myself back in a funk of depression I seem to dream and constantly think back to other times when I have felt horrible - in particular uni exams. During exam block I used to get extremely anxious and depressed. I always came out of it once they were over but it happened every semester. I don‚Äôt generally know what causes my depression and anxiety but when it does it hits hard and I just seem to keep going through the same cycles. I have a specialist and taking meds but I don‚Äôt seem to be keeping the black dog at bay. 
I don‚Äôt really know why I am posting this but I guess I am wondering if anyone else gets these types of flashbacks??
 
thanks for your time

Hello, I have postpartum depression and rage. I have been taking medication and am talking with my doctor about this but my partner knows all of this and he even has the rage too but when ever I have an angry episode he gets angry with me and tells me to get over my mood. When he is mad I help him calm down. I dont know what to do, I feel so unsupported and alone. Does anyone have this rage? What do you? 
Thanks for any help!

Hi guys, 
So I'm proud to this year I finally took my Psychologist's advice and tried dating/having fun with guys instead of stepping too far into the future, and man it felt good just to let go of all the expectations I had and just have fun with someone. And after months of looking for someone to get to know and trust, I found someone really special with everything I'm looking for. 
He is my perfect guy, he's incredibly intelligent, funny, charming and flirty and he's actually open about his sexuality. But, with the COVID-19 Pandemic he's currently in NSW working at a ski-field in order to keep busy until he can come back to Victoria. 
But lately, he's been more and more occupied with his time and when we talk he's either too tired or heading out to another shift. I'm trying to be the really supportive partner who's happy to be there when he's ready but I've had a bit of a fall into that dark hole after a pretty long run. 
I'm worried he's pulling away from me because he's no longer interested, even though he tells me he loves me every single day. But, the worst thing I'm worried about is my own mental health. This year I decided I felt ready and confident to stop taking my antidepressants with my BF helping me engage in a new alternative health program but now I'm scared I'll have another severe episode. 
Do you have any tips to manage a long-term relationship or for new alternative techniques?

Hi all! 
I'm new here but my problems aren't new. I'm a compulsive liar.
i remember telling little lies when I was younger, like, if something wasn't done or forgotten my mum would say ""we will just tell your dad this.."" that seemed to be the easy way out for everything.
As I got older, my lying increased, more so when my parents split and my dad drank a lot and my mum cut me off to spend time with her ""friend and his kids"" and only wanted to spend time with me when it was convenient. I gradually worked out how to lie to my parents to get what I wanted, whether it was to get out of going to school or to play them against each other. I knew it was wrong but I wasn't getting caught so it was easy. 
Then my dad found someone he wanted to spend his life with, he became a different person, but I stayed the same. I continued to lie until one day his now wife picked up on it, my dad said ""she wouldn't lie"" but I was. Always lying about something so that I didn't have to deal with the consequences. The thing that no one tells you is you have to remember every little lie you tell or it's going to come back and bite you on the bum and all that ""perfectness"" will turn to crap and stopping isn't just as easy as saying ""hey I just won't lie anymore"" you cannot stop yourself, the words just come out of your mouth and that's it. Another hole you've dug. 
Fast forward to today, where my lies have dug me into such a deep hole I cannot get back out, I'm anxious, I can't sleep, I'm depresssed, I've lost pretty much everyone that cares about me because of the lies. Today I decided that I'm tired, I'm tired of letting everyone down. I'm tired of feeling this way. I called someone for some help. I have to fix this before my daughter picks up on it and thinks it's okay to live your life this way. It's not. Anyone who's reading this and thinking that a few little lies are okay, it's not, those little lies turn into bigger lies by the second. Then eventually your lying becomes so out of hand that even when youre telling the truth no one believes you.
Sorry for the ramble I just needed to get it off my chest. I just feel so alone because of all the lies that I'm left with no one. 
thanks for reading

I feel empty, like there is nothing in life anymore. I go to work at a place i hate with a passion and then go home and sleep all the time.
 Yeah i know i have to talk to a profession or anybody but i over that, enough I don't want to do that and if thats what somebody is going tomtell me to do then this is no help.

I‚Äôm having a rough time not being able to see my family. We are all grieving over the death of my uncle (my dad‚Äôs younger brother)  
I‚Äôve never seen my dad so depressed in his life. My mum texted me, she is away for a while taking care of my grandma. She told me dads not coping too well and asked me to call my dad and try cheer him up. I had a long think about what I should actually say to him. But I had no idea... I called him anyway in hopes that the words would just come but I burst into tears the moment he answered. I wish I could help him and talk to him without crying. 
What do you do or say in situations like this?

Hi everyone, I suffer with severe anxiety and depression and I have fallen back into the darkness. I‚Äôm trying so so hard to pull myself out but it‚Äôs just exhausting. I am constantly having panic attacks before going to work which is leading to me not being able to work :( On Wednesday, I thought it was finally time to end it all as I was just sick of everything. I ended up ringing my community mental health and got a appointment with someone there. I got there and was asked questions about my life for what could trigger this... I feel so guilty because my life is awesome... my family, partner, home life is great. But I still feel sad. The man I spoke to ended up telling me that my life seems like it‚Äôs perfect from his point of view so I don‚Äôt have a lot to be sad about when I think about it. I was left feeling so guilty and upset about being sad in the first place... why do I deserve to be sad when I don‚Äôt have anything to put the blame on :(

Hi all,
I'm a low level manager at an organisation that sees itself as quite modern and progressive. I'm currently struggling heavily with a long running bout of both anxiety and (more immediately present) debilitating depression which is impacting my performance at work. I feel VERY busy, my day is full, but i succeed in achieving VERY little. Not being able to adequately add any value only serves to add to my worry and fear and fuels my dive into despair.
I speak to my wife regularly about leaving this role so i can have a breather and surface for air... But we can't afford this and my depression will only be fueled by new fears and stresses of finding a new role. 
i have constant ideation going on but this is not new, and not immediately concerning (though this can change rapidly).
anyway... My question is... Is there any value to be had in disclosing my current situation with my manager? I suspect (know) this would trigger hr to be informed and it would spell the end of my progression in this company (modern or not, i suspect this place is no different to any other) but perhaps something immediately positive would be a result. Or am i dreaming? Stigma is difficult to wash off and this is not a new position for me to be in, just perhaps more severe and prolonged (8-9 months?) than outbreaks I've encountered before.

I have been struggling with depression and ptsd since i left the army and lost my massive support base i had while i was in. It was made worse in 2013 when my partner at the time decided she no longer wanted me because I was no longer army and didn‚Äôt have the nice income flowing in. This sent me into an out of control spiral that was made worse by my parents and family treating me like crap because they seen her as the best i could get and my mates always getting drunk and high which caused me to try to commit suicide. And since then i have suffered from nightmares and bad days where my mind gets stuck in a loop of my mistakes and completely messes me up and is putting a major strain on the relationship i now have wirh my wife of two years as my past keeps rearing its ugly head when i either get too stressed or the insomnia takes over as it has tonight and no matter what I try i just cannot switch off the mechanisms that is my brain and memories from the past that make me feel like total crap within myself. It is worse that i don‚Äôt really have anyone else to talk to as we cant afford to see a counselling person and alot of my issues stem back to the army. It just makes life hard especially when all i want to do is sleep and curl up with my wife but my head gets so messed up that i dont get the satisfaction of having a decent sleep ever.

Hi i have no professional help. As i thought i found a new counsellor 
So i told my psychologist. I would like to try my counsellor. I've had 5 or 6 sessions
The last session I had with my counsellor, I asked if she could come along and support me at my drs appointment 
Anyways we get there and there was a mucked up. The nurse was laughing at the situation which made me feel embarrassed so i kinda went back into my shell, no eye contacts. We get home my counsellor and I were chatting g then she said I acted like a 6 or 7 years old. I found that really hurtful. And plus I had someone over and they heard it too. Which made me feel really low. 
Now due to being stage 4 lockdoen. I feel like my house and my head are becoming prisons. With no escape. I tried to tell  someone and they said oh well don't feel sorry for yourself. 
Feels like I'm just digging the hole deeper. And with no professional help now. I don't know what to do..

Before the virus all started, I was just getting better from dealing severe depression. And now I'm experiencing it all over again. My last year of school has been ruined, I have lost my job, my sporting season has been cancelled and I'm forced to stay at home. I've tried opening up to my family to talk about how I feel and I just get shut down every time. I try extremely hard to find things to do to keep me happy, but nothing works. I have no one to talk to and I feel so alone in my household. Can someone please give me advice or ideas on how to get through this.

Hi there,  I 

About 4 months ago after the bushfires my GP drew up a mental health plan to help me address some of my issues relating to my feelings of powerlessness.  I have been on SSRIs for about 30 years and have always had some underlying depression but have found myself to be pretty high functioning and I have always been able to keep my depression to myself and have only ever discussed it with my doctor (in a very limited way), having been to see a couple of therapists over this time but never able to discuss my issues so inflicting a lot of silence on the poor listener.   I am generally seen as a very strong, independent person who just gets on with things

I decided to give therapy another try with clearly defined goals and have a therapist I feel comfortable with and have been able to open up and genuinely describe many issues and started feeling positive and motivated to work towards change.  I am finding things increasingly difficult, as I think and write about many of the issues that are emerging.  Things are spiraling out of control as I realise how much I do and think is  driven by my low self esteem and poor sense of worth.  I am finding most of the CBT exercises impossible, unable to find a positive or kind thought and feel that all the therapy is doing is making things worse and extremely unpleasant.  I raised this with my therapist a few weeks ago, and she suggested taking a break for a month to let things settle down.  I have found the last weeks to be almost unbearable and found suicidal thinking becoming increasingly dominant.  I went to see my GP and while I didn't explain how I was thinking I found just seeing him brought some relief and I am horrified that I could seriously contemplate ending my life in this way. 

My question is should I stop therapy?  I went looking for a quick fix and while some of the issues I went in with are now resolved  I feel like I have opened up Pandora's Box.  The issues I am now identifying are so long standing and ingrained that I really can't see myself being able to change things.  While my emotional and personal life has been very moderated for a long time, it has also largely felt safe.  Therapy is making me feel unsafe and exposed and as the next appointment approaches I am wondering whether it would be best to walk away and find some relief.  I'm better existing with limited feelings rather than having these negative extremes dominating my thoughts.
Thanks for reading this.

One type¬†in particular.
About 2 years ago I went on this medication and at the 3 month mark I lost it. I was having panic attacks up to 6 a day, constantly worried, TIRED 24/7 no matter how much I slept, felt dizzy, light headed, I was sick every fortnight for about a year. I developed health anxiety and thought something was seriously wrong.. after multiple test, there was nothing wrong with me physically. I tried to speak to SOOOOO many doctors that all dismissed me and said ""nope. contraceptive pill does not do that"". and either offered me a prescription WITH NO hesitation or knowledge of my history or anything.. was just happy to give it to me whatever without asking anything about me.
I tried different drs as a lot of people said ok well maybe that just wasn't a good dr. nope.. every single dr did the same thing. They took my blood tests and just said ""yeah you're normal.... goodbye"" no help whatsoever, and I felt completely dismissed.
2 years later, I gave birth control another try... I thought maybe it was my external environment that was causing it. I'm in a much better place now, and no. Smack bang three months later (which is around now) I'm going through the EXACT same thing.
What is happening? Is anyone else having this sort of trouble with birth control?
(I have tried other brands- same outcome)

So ive been dealing with BPD for years and lately ive been struggling a little more than usual

So i recently got with a close friend of mine and we have been dating for about 3 weeks now.
I have been stressed and its taken a toll on my body, so my period has been a bit up and down.
I took a pregnancy test just to double check, i knew there was 99% chance i wasnt pregnant but i took it anyway.
I knew it would come up negative but i still feel absolutely wrecked that it wasnt positive.
Idk why i feel like this, im not in a position to have kids but i know that i want one really badly. 
I just feel like apiece of me is missing and i dont know what to do about it.

I used to be in a relationship where I could pour my heart out to him, tell him everything, anything and I would find answers and if there was no answers to my issues, at least there was a kindred spirit and a listening ear.  That was a while back, in my late teens but it was long distance and life moved too fast - I don't miss him, he is happy with someone else now but i desperately miss the relationship we had, miss having someone to turn too and just to feel comfortable telling them how i feel and knowing that i will be understood and cared about.  i have got myself into a situation where i don't have that link anymore, that ""place""you can go to where you can offload and know you won't be judged or despised....i feel lonely in my relationship and the idea that i have to reach outside for help, hurts.

hi all, 
Its been a awhile since I was on here but I'm finding it difficult to try and express how my depression is affecting my life to both everyone and my doctor. Don't get me wrong a doc is meant to help but I have lately been feeling that my doc is thinking that I'm using my depression as an excuse not to do things. And also I'm unemployed and looking for work and I have just started a new case worker for my unemployment obligations and I tried explaining how hard it is to look for work and even if I had a job how hard it is with depression. I would like to work but multiplied problems lie in front of me. I like this doctor that I'm seeing at the moment but should I change or stick it out. Also how do I deal with the case worker. I have only just had a week of good thoughts after 4 months of stress and anxiety due to covid 19 and my work for the dole place being shut down for that time and still closed. Any thoughts?

Hey everyone who reads.
I‚Äôm a healthcare worker, currently not working in Victoria. I‚Äôm 22 weeks pregnant and living through lockdown. I understand lockdown and it‚Äôs honestly not too bad. Until I watch the daily updates from Dan Andrews on Facebook and see all the comments about how it‚Äôs all a hoax and the government just wants to control us. As a healthcare worker this scares me, but I‚Äôve always seen stupid people. But as an expectant mother I‚Äôm terrified! Terrified that selfish people like this will keep us in lockdown longer, and when there is a vaccine, will endanger my baby, simply because they don‚Äôt believe in Covid. I‚Äôve been doing a lot of crying and feeling very scared, not wanting to let anyone visit my baby when she‚Äôs born. I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm going to lock myself and her away to keep her safe. Guess I‚Äôm just looking for anyone who understands, maybe has some tips for how to stay away from the toxicity on Facebook. It‚Äôs like a drug like I can‚Äôt stop reading it!
thanks in advance!

So sad just want my side to be heard. My wife of 27 years has Bipolar. After what has been a life time of being blamed for her sadness she was diagnosed 5 years ago. That made it clear but not easy on me in fact it helped her justify her behavior. I am still the vilan the cheater the cause of her deep sadness. My kids have grown up thinking it was their dad who was the bad person making mummy cry all the time. Now they are grown up they see it differently but still support their mum as the one that need help. While I continue to struggle alone. Last night my wife continued her abuse and my son has taken her away. Things escalated and I asked them not to come back. Now I am alone isolated with all the support removed with my safety net my family removed. Who helps me !

Hi,
Im a 34 year old male, no partner, no kids, no house, I pretty much have nothing and I like it that way. 
Now I'm ex military, I've accomplished everything I have ever wanted, plenty of money almost retired but I don't know if I can keep going for another 40+ years it just seems far too long. 
I hate travel, people and really everything... But I'm sure I'm missing something I can't find anything that I can enjoy and I've lost all enthusiasm for life.
Im sure it's a problem but I just want out and I'm done I'm pretty sure. I use to play a game with my old friends; I called it the bucket list... ""Name something I haven't done?"" And it would always end with me having done everything...(but farther kids) I have no desire to have kids, but I did raise a boy from the age of 1 till he was 7 and left to join the military so that's done. 
I guess what do you do when you have done everything you have ever wanted?

Hello, person reading this. If you have any advice, I‚Äôd love to hear it.
Every single day, my thoughts seem to be working against me. Telling me how much of a failure I am and how hopeless my predicament is. I just want my inner voice to shut up for a while. I am meant to be an adult but I don‚Äôt exist as one. I live with my parents and don‚Äôt have a job. I don‚Äôt even have my health. There‚Äôs something wrong with me and I thought it was chronic reflux but I am not so sure anymore. The other day, I bought three iced coffees during the day, and a snack with chilli powder in it. Then I had chocolate that evening. My throat was already giving me trouble that day, just from eating leftover pasta my mum made. So I was just thinking that I was suffering already anyway. I just went all out. But none of it did anything. If anything, it made me feel better because I could finally enjoy things I was actively avoiding. I‚Äôm so confused. I also stopped taking PPIs for the reflux a week earlier. But my throat still bothers me almost daily. I don‚Äôt know why.
I‚Äôm depressed for a more serious reason, though.¬† I‚Äôm so, so scared...I go to sleep every night dreading that I‚Äôm impotent. I feel my heart pound in my chest when I‚Äôm at rest. During the day, I pace around the house. I bite my nails.¬† I pull my hair out by constantly twisting it around my index finger and pulling. I cry. I feel so worthless and hopeless and I have stuff to study but I just don‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm in a long-distance relationship and she‚Äôs my world and she is patient and says it‚Äôll all be okay and that it isn‚Äôt my fault but I don‚Äôt listen. I don‚Äôt deserve a partner if I‚Äôm impotent, do I?
I‚Äôm on antidepressants but they don‚Äôt stop the inner voice. They don‚Äôt stop me from feeling worthless. They don‚Äôt stop me from feeling like a prisoner in my own body. I don‚Äôt know how much more I can take.

I‚Äôm alone. In every way.
For the last 15 weeks what was keeping me going was the little boy growing inside of me. Two days ago his heart stopped beating,
I can‚Äôt do life without him. I can‚Äôt birth him or see him. I‚Äôll never know him. I want to be with him. I‚Äôm going to be with him soon. I don‚Äôt know if people will think I‚Äôm being selfish or something but I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôve struggled with myself for 12 years. This was going to be my saving grace, my little Isaac. I‚Äôm alone. I have been since I found out his heart stopped. I told his dad and I got told it was my fault and I deserved it. I‚Äôm not living in this world. Maybe I‚Äôll go to heaven, I don‚Äôt know I can‚Äôt think right now. I just want to not be here. I don‚Äôt want help, nothing can help me, I know me. This will never go away which is why my decision is easy.
Whats stopped me in the past was I was scared of making someone else feel the way I felt. I have no one in my life anymore so I don‚Äôt have to worry about that.
when I say I have no one I mean no one.
I‚Äôm alone and I‚Äôll die alone.
I‚Äôm silenced and forever will be.

I know I‚Äôm ranting and I‚Äôm sorry. I just need someone to hear me out.

I‚Äôve always felt frustrated and angry since I can remember. As a child, I had violent outbursts and breakdowns out of seemingly nothing. As I‚Äôve gotten older, that anger still resides deep down and never really goes away.  No matter how many times I tell myself I‚Äôm fine and I‚Äôll change, it never subsides. I had a pretty ordinary childhood, so I can‚Äôt blame my parents or anything for these feelings. I‚Äôve just always had them and that‚Äôs that. Nowadays, I‚Äôm still seething to the point where I want to ruin everything and everyone, including myself. On top of that, I feel dull and have given up on living. There are some days where I‚Äôll lie down in bed for hours and do nothing cause the things that once made me happy, seem too hard or not worth it anymore. Deep down, I know it‚Äôs self-destructive and I‚Äôve desperately tried to change my attitude. However, it‚Äôs getting to the point where I wish I wasn‚Äôt born or the world would be better of without me.

My relationships with others are also unstable at times. One minute we‚Äôll be fine, the next I‚Äôll be yelling and taking out all my issues onto them. I‚Äôve told my family numerous times that I thought there was something wrong with me, but they usually dismiss it. They say ‚Äòyou‚Äôre just stressed‚Äô or ‚Äòanxious,‚Äô which is probably true to an extent.  However, I still can‚Äôt explain why I randomly pick fights with everyone, even though they‚Äôve never done anything. Also, I don‚Äôt understand why one minute I love everyone and cling to them, then the next, I hate them and push them away. It‚Äôs like paranoia. I‚Äôm so worried or afraid everyone hates me, that I‚Äôd rather hurt them, before they hurt me. I barely try to make friends cause I have such a strong distrust of everyone I meet. I‚Äôm so antisocial now that I don‚Äôt even really have friends anymore. I stopped keeping in touch with them and they moved on.

It feels like I‚Äôm trapped in purgatory and can‚Äôt escape. Everything is moving around me while I'm being devoured by anger, insecurity and insanity.

If you don't know from my previous posts, I am living in Victoria and moving interstate due to loss of job opportunity because of lockdown. 
I have the approval to move back, but as you all know, COVID is constantly getting worse in Vic as people are too selfish to stay inside and isolate. I have been isolating since the beginning of March and it is really ticking me off that so many selfish people are ruining it for everyone. I am on an inhaler and have lung issues so if I were to catch it, it could cause major issues, more than usual.
My issue stems from the fact that I am completely alone in Victoria. Pretty much everything is packed except a few things outside my room, but my foot is twice the size due to all the standing and walking up and down the stairs in my house taking things to the tip or getting rid of furniture ect. I can barely walk but I have to as I have more stuff to take the tip and pack, which is only going to make the pain worse. My only family down here are being incredibly selfish and won't help me or give me any support at all. My family back home are all telling me what to do but not helping me at all or telling me how to do all of these things they expect from me, with the excuse ""You're an adult, figure it out yourself"". I have never ever done anything like this before and was not taught how, itsn't that your job? Aren't you stupposed to teach me, and help me when I stumble? Isn't that what family are supposed to do? You brought me into this world, I didn't choose it, you're supposed to help me live. My housemates are being awful as usual, and actually cancelled the lease without consulting me (I'm not on the lease because they broke the law, long story) and now I need to be out within 2 weeks. If I am not, I will be living out of my car while all of my stuff is on route interstate.
I have approval to get through the border, but I have no way to get to the airport because again, selfish family are the only people I know. I would usually catch public transport but SkyBus is cancelled and public transport when the virus is at its worst? Not a good idea. Flights are also few and far between.
I am depressed and scared and stressed and alone and I just want the stress to end. I want COVID to end. I'm so sick of this. My friends are still helping me but honestly I just feel numb. I feel like I don't actually feel anything at all. My anxiety is through the roof and I have nothing to help combat it.

I was very shy and got bullied for it in primary school by this one girl who convinced my friends to push me away, I started playing this online game that my older brother influenced me to play (11 years of age) I enjoyed it for the game-play but eventually I met people on it,  I learnt things I wasn't supposed to at that age and became very attached to people on it and the game - I went on it after school everyday and found it hard to get off. I met a lot of bad people (most of them predators) I had to learn the hard way of trusting people online. I was diagnosed with depression and severe social anxiety disorder soon after I first self harmed when I was 12 and I had just started high school. I had trouble with this one girl and that's when my absence first starting going down,the bullying stopped after I told staff but the feeling of depression and loneliness didn't.  Year 9 - I was struggling to get up everyday, I cried and had anxiety attacks almost everyday and I never showed up to school. I decided to leave school resulting in not going to school for 2 years and my high school friends blocked me and said I brought toxic energy into their lives - I know I didn't say or do anything to so they meant my mental health and that really damaged me. I'm now I'm in Year 11 and I've been attending this different school for around 7 weeks and slowly but surely I started to skip days, I cried when I got to school last week and told my mum it was too hard to go in and I didn't even go at all this week. Everyday for the past 3 weeks I've been feeling depressed about school and the past 3 days have been the worst, I've been feeling physically sick of symptoms of fatigue, drowsiness, tiredness,crying a lot for no good reason,having episodes of feeling depressed but I feel nothing really that bad is happening to me, no one at that school is causing me trouble and my home life is fine. So why do I feel like this? Why is it so damn hard to get up? Why is it so hard for me to attend school? I don't know the answer to any of it, everyone else in the world can do it but I've never been able to go to school without feeling terrible and mentally drained. I have a choice to go to school and complete Year 11 (self paced work, you finish when you finish) or leave school and look for a job/ volunteer but I reckon I wont end up nowhere on that path. I'm so stuck and have no clue what to do.  I would really appreciate any words from anyone.

Hello, I have reached a very dark place in my mind and felt a little comforted when I found these forums on this website. I'm not one to burden anyone with my 'problems' as I know every person has things on their mind, especially these days during the pandemic. But I am desperate now. I feel I need to post something in the hope that there might be at least one person here who may make me feel that maybe everything will be ok.  About 7 weeks ago, I was stood down from my job due to allegations that were created by my Manager and his Boss to undermine my character in order for my Employer to dismiss me. And all because I made a bullying complaint against my Manager. I was bullied at work for months...it left me feeling extremely anxious, depressed and even a little traumatised. When I finally complained, my Manager retaliated against me and the bullying became far worse. I ended up going to the Fair Work Commission in the hope that my job could be saved and I would not be dismissed based on false allegations.  In the past 7 weeks I have been stood down, HR harassed me with emails.  And in a few weeks, I must face them in a conciliation hearing and hope my job will be saved.  On top of this, my little Dog, who is my entire world, has become terminally ill and we may have to put her down in a matter of days or weeks. The thought of which absolutely kills me. I have a history of anxiety and depression since my late teens. But this is the worst I have experienced so far...my mind has been in such darkness and despair the past few days, made worse by Melbourne being plunged into Stage 4 lockdown. I understand everyone has a lot on their mind right now, but I have turned to the people here because I am in desperate need of someone to listen and care and I feel my pain will be understood here. I am blessed to have parents and a twin brother and a few good friends. We don't talk about such things in my family. And I don't want to burden the 2 or 3 close friends I can confide in. I feel they won't understand how depression like this destroys you.

Thankyou for taking the time to read this. I wish you the best x

Hi, recently I have been feeling really pessimistic but I don't know how to change it. (By the way I'm not going to start self harm or commit suicide, just thinking)
Just after self isolation started, I starting really thinking about this, whats the point?
I feel like there is no point to go on. We are all going to die anyways so whats the point of living? Nothing really matters because its all going to go away. It doesn't even matter if we make a huge impact on this world, because we are going to be forgotten- the human species is going to go extinct some time in the future- even if its really far away- the whole universe will drift apart and there will be no light. So there is no point to earth even existing let alone me- a tiny little speck in this giant universe. I sometimes feel like us humans shouldn't exist either- there is so much suffering that it would be better off without anything at all.
I feel like there isn't a point to keep on struggling with good grades, keeping up with friends and exercising because I am going to die anyways.
I kinda just want to give up.
Another reminder, I have no interest in self harm or committing suicide.

I‚Äôm 16, have been depressed and very anxiety-ridden for 4 years, and I feel like I‚Äôm going to reach a breaking point. Not to the point of hurting someone else, but to the point of severely hurting myself. I can‚Äôt hold conversations with anyone anymore, I‚Äôm so self conscious and I‚Äôm ultimately a really sad person. I‚Äôve isolated myself from my friends, I‚Äôve gained quite a prevalent stutter, teachers don‚Äôt talk to me anymore because I look so miserable all the time, and it‚Äôs even getting to a point where I can‚Äôt talk to my little brother because we‚Äôve kind of grown apart for a few years, my older brother doesnt talk to me because we had an argument a while ago and he‚Äôs too scared to reconcile, my dad has another family to look after now, and I have no interest in doing anything to better myself. I realise that this is all just me wallowing in my self-pity, but I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Therapy costs too much, the stigma that counselling has at my school will just make people think less of me and I doubt any helplines will ever actually be able to help me. I don‚Äôt have anyone left. I can‚Äôt see myself going on for much longer. I‚Äôve lost all of the joy in my face, and I can‚Äôt envision a future where I don‚Äôt feel like this. Please don‚Äôt feel compelled to reply. I‚Äôm just venting, and don‚Äôt want to be a burden to anyone.

I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for the past 4 years (I‚Äôm 16 now), and it is slowly just getting worse. I think I‚Äôve messed up with keeping relationships with people. The past four years I haven‚Äôt been trying to connect with people (because of my mental health problems), and now, I cannot connect with people. 

I don‚Äôt know how to act. I don‚Äôt have a clue who I am. And I know I‚Äôm just 16, but I‚Äôm not interested in anything. I don‚Äôt have passion. I don‚Äôt have excitement. Everything is just one, long, dull moment of nothingness. And I can‚Äôt talk to people. I seriously cannot. And if anyone replies to this, please don‚Äôt judge if I struggle in my reply. 
I can‚Äôt talk to my mum or dad or brothers, and I don‚Äôt have friends. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Im finding it really hard to keep up my full time job because I dont really find much joy in it anymore and I get treated horribly as a trainee. I dont think im right for the job because im always being judged and laughed at because im not that strong or confident.
I want a different life.
I tried to talk to my bosses and supervisors about how im going outside of work and how this job is really affecting me and they dont know what to do or how to help.
I dont really find much joy in anything anymore. I get only a few hours of sleep a week. I feel guilty and ashamed to be around friends and family because of my constant mood.
I just really want to be somebody else.
I've tried to get help and nothing has worked, medicine makes me worse and alcohol just brings everything to the surface and I breakdown and shut everyone out.
I dont know what I can do.
Im only 20 but I really dont see myself feeling better anytime soon.

Hi.

This is really unusual for me to open up.
It's a first on a forum but I'm trying everything I can to help myself getting better in hard times and potentially helping someone who would have the same struggles than me.

I have been struggling with my mental health since my early teenage years, more than 15 years now.
Originally from France, I have been seeking help multiple times and never received any help from either peers or professionals.
Talking about mental health is still quite a taboo there.
I don't have much of a family left due to severe family dramas and my mother's passing when I was 13.
There was only my father and I remaining.

My father has always been really rough on me and in denial mostly all my life.
When experiencing what was my first depression, he used to drag me out of bed because I couldn't get up to go to school, exhausted that I was.
I don't blame him, it was his way to ""help"" me, to ""shake"" this out of me (a lot of people act like this and been acting like this in my life).
Also had the luck at 18 to fall for a psychopath narcissist who sucked the life out of me for 3 years and almost killed me in the end.
Unfortunately, the police never really did anything against him.

After long years of battle with fear and my mental health getting worse, I decided to leave the country and settled down in Australia.
Two years ago, I have been diagnosed with Bipolar II which was as much of a punch in the face than a relief.
Medication helps me manage my low moods and my sleep but I am still struggling periodically with strong and deep depressive episodes (I am going through one as I am typing).

In the last year and a half, I have been hospitalised twice.
The first time for suicide attempt (I then was placed in a psychiatric ward for a few days),
The second time because going through a severe hypomanic episode, I lost control of myself after 4 days without sleeping.

I am extremely grateful to be in Australia and receive so much support and also been informed enough for me to read efficiently through my different mood.

I am here because I needed to get it out. It is helpful to put it there.
If anyone needs to talk or needs help, helping others helps me more than anything.

Remember than speaking is already helping and silence isn't always golden.

Much love and thank you for reading me.

I need some projects or inexpensive hobbies that I can improve on and feel accomplished about. I'm 20 years old and have a full time job that makes it very hard to cope with what I currently have going on. I enjoy hands on things like construction and computers. I'm finding it really hard to feel like I'm worth something so if I find things I can work on or create, I might feel something.

I have recently begun my journey for self help as I began to spiral and relied only on my boyfriend for support. This has caused him to leave me as it is too much for him to handle. This has hurt me immensely but I understand and it has made me realise I cannot rely solely on others and hope it helps me heal. I have multiple mental illnesses which makes coping extremely difficult at times, because if my depression is at bay, my anxiety can rise and vice versa. I also have insomnia and I know I need to fix this as sleep is extremely important in getting better. 
My main question is, with my depression, when I am in my lowest state I always have the feeling that I want to go home, which I believe would have sprouted from my childhood and being constantly bullied at school. Unfortunately, my home no longer feels like home and I don't know how to make it feel like home again. Does anybody have any tips for creating a safe space to help with my depression?

Since this bloody virus has put me and my family in lockdown due to a chronic lung condition,  I've been home schooling my son, a lot of cleaning, cooking, knitting, diamond painting, reading and my own worst enemy thinking.  I feel so overwhelmed and I just want to crawl into a ball and cry.  I do have a psychiatrist but I feel like I would be wasting his time.  I have never realized how depressed I can get.  I feel like a failure, being all these things and not succeeding.  My son tells me that I'm the best mummy he could ever have.  I hate feeling like this!  I love my family and I know that they love me, but sometimes it's not enough.  I'm also going through a messy settlement with my ex husband.  He has turned around and called me an alcoholic crap parent.  I gave up drinking when I kicked him out.  It feels good to get things off my chest. I'm shaking like a leaf and trying to keep it together for my family.  I don't like them seeing me like this.

As being diagnosed with chronic depression at 15, and a survivor from suicide, this is a post aimed to feel like i am talking to you, the person reading this; To tell you a little thing that kept me alive.. 'hope.' As it is such a irritable and useless feeling to try and find help when feeling that you do not need it as life is just a 'waste.' That, which i just said, is depression talking, and oh trust me how much it lies. It's like it has its own disorder within the disorder (if that makes sense), being compulsive lying. Tells you all the negatives, but no positives, yet that is only because your not looking the other way for that very small to very big positive emotion. So, what do you do? Many things, you can continue to listen to the lies that seem so true making you believe nothing else but negative emotions, as well as avoidance and isolation etc... Yet just imagine, just imagine what once made you happy, and is still within your ability for you to gain whatever this happiness was, or dream to a achievable part in the future that you know will make you happy; that is just a part of hope. Only the start, to for once, try to ignore the lies inside your head, and hope... Hope for what is to come and happen and dream, because once you can do that, your on your way to not only beating this, becoming stronger, but telling yourself you did it, with dreams and hope.

Hi,
Since 2016 Ive been battling depression.
In the recent 6 months I've started talking to a councillor and it's the first time since 2016 I've tried to help myself, but even still it doesn't help nothing good ever happens for me, I always try and help other people give them what deserve but whatever I give myself always goes wrong sooner or later.
Was about to purchase my first car today and was told by the dealer that had held the car for me then sell it out from under me, got refused for a car loan, can't get the job I wanted because I've already done a Cert III in something else, gave myself 2 bulging discs in December in my lumbar spine and has been causing discomfort every since. That's just skimming the iceberg.
My mate died is 2016 but the last thing I ever said to him was in an argument, in 2018 I purchased a parrot to help myself get past my depression, a few months later I snap in anger and throw my parrot into a door and he died. I can't express the guilt I have for these things.
On top of all that I'm autistic which constantly causes problems for me over my school years I was very badly bullied over it, something 10 years later I still struggle with. 
I have a very supportive family (especially my cousin) who I talk to regularly however nothing anyone seems to do or say makes me better and nothing seems to stop this curse as I consider it.

But perhaps I can help you.  I won't go into a lot of detail, however if want any specifics please ask.  They're not secret.  I'm honestly just tired of talking about myself to so many different psychiatrist, GP's, psychologist, clinical nurses and on it goes.  And then you get a 'new' diagnosis and they act like I'm supposed to be happy.  It's just another label.  Can you fix it?  No?  Well, let's move on then.
Yes, I'm a bit sarcastic.  The Mental Health System in SA is so broken.
I was a very hard worker, in fact I worked my way up to General Manager.  I was described as tenacious by my Employers and I loved working.  Until one day out of the blue I had a nervous breakdown (or major depressive episode as they call it now).  I was 46.  I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and put on Anti Depressants.  Everyone was shocked.  How could this happen to her?  She's one of the strongest people I know.  etc, etc,
The months went on and became years, and I was eventually diagnosed BP2.  It fit.  The manic states where I'd work 20 hours a day.  The days I'd wake up and say we're building x today and everyone just assumed I was spontaneous.  But I didn't have too many lows until after the breakdown.  That seemed to be a catalyst.
A few weeks ago I got another diagnosis of complex ptsd.  No surprises there really.  I won't go into details but something so traumatic happened to be I tried to take my life.  I didn't succeed that day so I tried again the next.  I was hospitalised just for the night as they believed it was because of the traumatic incident.
But now I have triggers.  They're bad and they make me spiral into bouts of depression I can't pull myself out of.  Everything is black.  My partner can't talk me down.  I have to say the staff at Mental Health Triage are pretty good at calming me.
I'm no longer on any meds.  No anti depressants, no anti psychs.  The side effects are horrible.  Me getting seratonin syndrome and my partner having to deal with a drunk person for three days just isn't worth the grief I cause.  Or him finding me out in the street at 3am in the middle of winter with nothing on but a tshirt.  
If you read the leaflet that comes with the meds and go down to the 1% of the population will suffer from you'll find me in there.
So what do I do?  Essentially I do nothing.  I don't live, I exist.  I also have 4 herniated discs which cause a lot of pain.
I live for the manic moments.  They're the only time I'm happy.  I wish I could work.

Guess I just need to vent and get some suggestions
i was recently in hospital for 4 weeks because of my mental health it is still unclear as to what is going on but I feel like I can‚Äôt deal with it and that I don‚Äôt want to be like this for the rest of my life, I was manic for about 2-3 and have now started to come down where I feel the complete opposite I just feel so depressed so ready to give up all I want is to feel happy and stay that way but it feels like this will never happen and I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to help myself. I feel like I‚Äôm such a burden on all my family and now that I‚Äôm home they only got 1 good week with me where I was an amazing mum and partner and now it‚Äôs back to feeling like shit all the time, be exhausted, being overwhelmed with everything and not getting enjoyment out of the stuff I should and it‚Äôs killing me. I know how much my moods effect the people around me and it‚Äôs not like I wouldn‚Äôt change them if I could. But as I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong I don‚Äôt know what to do if I‚Äôm on the right meds or anything. I just want help and answer and it feels like that is Never going to happen üò≠

Hi everyone,
I‚Äôve had some mental health issues for a while. In high school I used to self harm and was close to suicide. I‚Äôm 42 and still want to die. Things are really bad this year and I am so close with going through with it but my partner and mother are the only things keeping me alive. I know my death would ruin their lives. They wouldn‚Äôt get over it. I feel though I‚Äôm sacrificing my ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù and putting them before me.
Yesterday I was so close to doing it. Next week I find out if I still have a job but at this stage, I really don‚Äôt care. I‚Äòve done the best with my life but it‚Äôs time to go. In a previous attempt my note said I love them and to get over it (only my partner knows about that attempt) but I feel like I want to tell them what I feel before I go as a courtesy and to say I love them.
I can‚Äôt ask them for help either, it‚Äôll hurt them so I just feel even worse. Yesterday I wanted someone to take me to some mental health unit so they will understand my problems and it won‚Äôt come as a shock.
I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm writing this, here on the couch crying and what this will accomplish. Once they die or If we become estranged I‚Äôll definitely do it but life is such a struggle and I‚Äôm ready to hang up my boots. There will become a point however when I can no longer place their happiness above mine. It will be sad but I just wasn‚Äôt meant to live this life.
FYI, I have tried therapy, medication, etc but nothing works. One day it will get so bad I‚Äôll have to go ahead but to hurt them like that is so cruel.
I am just lost, confused and unhappy.
sorry, I think I just needed to write this down rather than ask for help as I‚Äôm beyond that.

Hi,
I've had issues with employment for the past two years. As it stands, I have a full time job that I thoroughly enjoy, pays well. My wife works part time, three days per week. I'm also studying full time at university. I want her to be happy, and have what she wants, but I've lost a number of jobs in recent years but I usually walk into another within a fortnight - I am so lucky, I know.
She made some comments yesterday, indicating that I'm a financial leach.
- ""I am sick of holding this up with only my money"". I'm selfish, etc. etc. etc.
She decided to take some of her superannuation out, and when she got it, she wanted to use some of it to clear off some small debts, never (ever) did I ask her to take money out for that. If I'd have known that was her plan, I would've spoken to her against doing it. Now, she's thrown that in my face ""I worked for that money, MY money paid off this debt, MY money, not yours"". She has really emphasized that it was her money, not mine, or not ours. I've always looked at money like it's ours. We have a joint-bank account, we both contribute. No matter what I do now, she's holding that against me. And I'm concerned that this will last forever.
I'm working full time so we can afford her to work part time. Next year, in 2021, she's taking up study - leaving her job to do so. And I've been, and will continue to be, supportive of this. 
Honestly, all of this (+ my already depleting mental state) makes me feel like I'm worthless - simply a banana peel on the bottom of a full bag of garbage. I feel like a waste of space. I feel like an economic waste of space. I feel like, no matter what I do now, her superannuation will always be held above me. I attempted to take out my own super (after hearing of how she feels) to give to her, to put back into her own. I obviously can't do that, but, god, I would if I could. If I had things worth selling, I'd sell and give her the money.
I'm working so hard to find my place. I'm studying, working - wanting her to work part time (in fact, I'm encouraging it). Yet, I feel like a terrible husband. I've done many relationship quizzes in the past two days to find out if I'm a bad partner - and I've been honest - and nothing in there indicates that I am. However, I feel like I am. It's like a burden constantly in my mind. I'm always trying to be better, but consistently falling short.
Sorry, if this sounds dramatic. Maybe it's COVID-19, but I feel so alone right now. Money is the devil.
Thanks,
DB.

So 2 years ago i went on medication for depreasion and anxiety. 
Suffered from ilnesses for about 10 years and finally tried medication then. 
Its helped a heap, anxiety is almost gone but still got depression.

I had never felt so alive world went from black and white to full of colour but then i had 2 major episodes. Wasn't great.
Me and doc talked and ive been back on medication
Lifes just not interesting. I feel no emotion towards anything. He has surgested maybe swapping medication see how i go with that one.

Hello,

I'm writing in hopes of getting some help from people who have been in a similar experience or are knowledgeable on PND and GAD. My husband has not been professionally diagnosed, but has admitted to being anxious all the time and has struggled to connect with our 1.5 year old when she was born, and now our 3 week old son, so I am suspecting this is what he may have. I have been with him for 11 years, we have been married for 3 and we are both in our mid-late 20's. Through this time my husband has struggled to hold a job for more than a year due to the fact he believes he deserves more and wants to make a bigger difference in the world. He is currently not working and hasn't been for the past 6 months. When he was a toddler his dad passed away from an overdose and so was raised (with his two older brothers) by his verbally and emotionally manipulative mother - he is still in constant contact with her, but I refuse to have someone like that in my life. To make things worse we live with my parents as neither of us are working and I think that really affects his self esteem as he isn't providing for his family and is relying on someone else. I love him and I'm happy to work through his problems with him, but he REFUSES to seek help as he thinks getting a job will help his problem - this has not worked in the past. He lashes out with anger, abusive words and is emotionally manipulative when he has his extreme lows. This is becoming extremely difficult for me to deal with on a daily basis. He needs help. I need help. I'm not sure what to do. I keep thinking life would be easier if we weren't together; but the last thing he needs right now is a disconnect from the only support he has.

Thanks for listening.

I was really close with a girl, having a long distance relationship, and everything was going well, she liked talking to me and loved me. We talked a lot every single day and night. In June I noticed she started being a little different, she started going to sleep more late. We used to always call every night, she started to say that she can‚Äôt call tonight, or she would sometimes say her phone is stuffing up.

One day, she just didn‚Äôt want to talk to me, she didn‚Äôt seem enthusiastic to talk and lied about going out when she was at home, I also noticed she stopped sending me snapchat streaks 2 days before this. Later that night I asked why she is being different and she said everything is fine. I then said I love you like we always do and she didn‚Äôt respond normally but said ‚Äúluv you‚Äù. Later she said she doesn‚Äôt want to be attached to me and it‚Äôs more realistic for her to go for someone that lives near her.

A day after this happened, she said she wants to go back to being how we were and doesn‚Äôt like this small talk. She mentioned she cried, and cried when I texted her and when I said it didn‚Äôt seem like you wanted to talk much or have much to do with me, she said she was overwhelmed and wants to have much to do with me and talk to me. A day later I noticed she was being a little different again in the morning, it‚Äôs like she didn‚Äôt want to talk again. We continued talking until 2 days after being back together I woke up in the morning to find she removed me off her socials. We were talking normally just the night before this happened, it was a shock.

I've had enough of my depression, I'm on medication and I'm not seeing any councilor but my depression is controlling and it want allow me to enjoy my life and hobbies. I know this might sound funny or even weird, but it's true. This covid19 isn't helping either as it's put a damper on one of my activities I was doing and enjoying. 
I'm trying to keep active but it's hard when you have two prolapsed discs in my lower back and in pain every day. I do take pain relief but this also affects my depression as well. 
My husband has depression as well and he loves me very much and tries to help me, but its hard to explain to him how you feel. I will stop here.

Hello,
It's been a while since my last post because I thought everything was going well with me. But apparently not. So I'm here to vent again.
The last 12months have been worse than ever and I'm deteriorating from the inside. Last year I was told by my psychologist that she couldn't quite work me out and that she suspects I have BPD. I admit it made me feel so uncomfortable. More so than having to be there for my anxiety & depression. It overwhelmed me to the point that I left and never made another appointment with that psychologist again.
I know I should have at least found another psychologist to confirm the diagnosis, but I stubbornly told myself that I will be ok and to just keep on going. Pretty sure I was in denial.
At the beginning of the year I enrolled myself into a course for Accounting & Bookkeeping blindly believing that I would be fine if I just engage myself in something to keep me occupied. I struggled halfway when lockdown was announced and we had to move to remote learning. I started losing focus and interest. I found myself staring into space and sometimes that lead to stupor. I just felt stuck.I managed to finish the course with an increase in my meds, but really doubtful of getting a job in that field. Plus I didn't really have much interest for it. But I was being constantly encouraged to do something.
It has been 3wks since the end of my course and I just have no motivation. No positivity. I only get about 3-4hrs broken sleep so I'm constantly tired. I break out in tears for no particular reason except that I feel really down. I've been losing my sense of time. I constantly question who I am while my partner just sees it as an excuse to do nothing and thinks I'm just being childish. Lately, I've felt more comfortable in my dreams like it's the opposite effect. As if the world I wake up to is the dream. And the dream is the real world.
I know I had to do something about it before I wither away into nothingness. So I took the step to get a new referral to another psychologist and a referral to see a psychiatrist. There's a part of me that's scared as hell because genetically, it makes sense. My mother & brother have bipolar and depression. So why wouldn't I? But another part of me is eager to know just how crazy I am. While another part, the small & insignificant part, just wants to crawl under a rock and never hear of it again.
I want to be a better person, I really do. But it's like my feet are buried in cement.

Hi amazing people
Just a few days ago I shared my story and I was feeling really positive about things. I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2014, but for the last few years I have coped really well. Today I'm having a bit of a bad day to be honest. Last night my husband told me he might have to call his work company quits before it goes bang because of this virus. I had no idea things were so bad for his company. He has spent years working hard and his company was doing so well until recently. I'm a bit in shock and now for the first time in years I'm feeling anxious because he's the bread winner in our family and I feel so bad for him. We have a pretty high mortgage, a baby and lots of other expenses. I'm trying to stay optimistic but not having the best day. We've also cancelled our fertility treatment for November we were hoping to have another child but that just won't happen now. I'm feeling a bit devastated üò¢ just in need of some encouragement.

Hi there
Just wanted to introduce myself and share a brief story about my journey with bipolar, depression and anxiety.
At twelve years old I moved from South Africa to New Zealand. We were so poor at that time. It was then that I became a target for bullies. My parents were stressed and fighting alot at the time so I told nobody I was being bullied. Anxiety was something I started to experience when I was roughly seven years old because of my dyslexia. 
After being bullied for years and moving from one place to the next because of dads work I was hit hard with depression at the age of nineteen. Back then I didn't know I had depression. I started to drink to try and numb some of the pain. By the age of 23 I was definitely an alcoholic.
When I was 24 I moved to Australia after being in an abusive relationship. I needed a fresh start. For five years after that I began to struggle with my mood, sleep and severe depression and anxiety. When I was twenty nine I just wasn't coping with life and I had a nervous breakdown and was taken to hospital. I was given the diagnosis bipolar disorder due to my mood swings. 
It was during the darkest time in my life I realised how strong I am. I was put on so many medications with loads of terrible side effects that one day I tried to end my life. 
I was hospitalized twice after that. Then I had CBT therapy and I did Art therapy. My psychiatrist finally found the right medication for me after so much trial and error. I quit drinking, started walking for exercise and eating healthier. My new partner proposed and I got married. 
Then came the news that my husband couldn't have children. But I was determined to be a mum and stick by my husband no matter what. Where there is a will there is a way. We ended up having a donor child which was very stressful at first but now the best thing that has ever happened to us. 
It has been one hell of a journey. I'm still learning every day. Today I have more good days than bad and I'm really enjoying life. I actually never thought I'd say that but here I am and doing well. I often think about if I had taken my life that day I wouldn't have what I have today. All I can say to anyone struggling is to keep going, stay strong, this will pass and tomorrow is a brand new day. 
It's not a easy journey. When I  came out on the other side I was so grateful to experience happiness again after years of struggle and challenges. I'm not completely cured but I have learnt how to cope. 
Never give up üòä

Hi, I'll try to keep it short but with enough info.

I lost my job in March not because of covid but by being screwed over by a co-worker ( I think this is where I started to feel extremely depressed )
but I tried to not let it phase me, I was seeing someone at the time, she is wonderful, I put more time into her than she did for me and when she told me that we are probably better off being friends, it hurt. I knew it wouldn't work out between us, because I want children and to live a simple life while she doesn't want kids and wants to live large. I knew it wouldn't work but she was such a genuine, honest and caring person, she took me out of my comfort zone, improved my health and wellbeing and taught me a lot but I can't let go of the feeling that my life is going to be.. different in a bad way , maybe not having kids wouldn't be so bad if I got to stay with her.
I visited her a few days ago and she wanted to let me know that she has been dating someone, it tore through me, it was only about 2 weeks after she wanted to be friends, she admitted that she didn't have the same feelings for me that I did for her. She told me about him, he sounded perfect, Dr, Tall, Bodybuilder, and I can't help but compare myself. Which I know doesn't help. I've had breakups before, but this felt different, I truly feel like I've lost the only thing that could make me feel good.

It just feels like I lost everything I was happy for in my life in one go, I stopped going to Gym, walking, going out, enjoying life, it's all of a sudden a struggle to leave my computer chair, I don't even enjoy playing games anymore, started eating a lot of fast food, I've turned down multiple job offers, become lazy and complacent with a sad outlook on life, I cry sometimes for a reason and other times I cry for no apparent reason at all, I get massive anxiety out of the blue and it doesn't seem to go away, and my GP just put me on an antidepressant¬†which makes me feel like I have a problem.

I guess what I'm asking for is any idea on how to move on or make myself realize it's not the end of the world, I feel hopeless and I'm finding it quite pointless to keep trying at life.

I‚Äôve been wanting to speak to someone about how I‚Äôm feeling for a long time but I‚Äôm not able to.
i feel like I have no friends. All of those people that I consider my friends have other people they are close to and end up leaving me out. I partly feel like I‚Äôm to blame, because I‚Äôm not much of a phone person and so I don‚Äôt actively participate in group chats/ social media. 
but seeing everyone have someone, has left me feeling alone and empty. I feel like nobody genuinely cares. 

I‚Äôm not very close with my family and can‚Äôt talk about this with them. And I feel like my boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt understand how im feeling, since he has not had any difficulty socialising with people. 

any replies will be useful, thanks :)

Hey guys!
Over the past month or so I have been here a LOT and I have been really struggling mentally, physically and emotionally. I was either sleeping for 15 hours or 3 hours and everything was thrown off and I spiraled down into my another really suicidal point in my life about a week or so ago, which has happened a couple times in my life including an attempt when I was a teenager. 
I am still struggling now, but with the help of some really amazing online friends who are my cheerleaders and tell me every day how much they love me, including one who said, and I quote, ""If you do anything I will summon you with a ritual just to beat up ghost you."" which made me laugh for about 3 hours straight, I feel better about the support I have, even if it's not in person and it is only online.
As some of you may know from my previous post, I am moving house and the rubbish in my room has been accumulating and accumulating, to the point where I could barely walk around in my room because there was so much rubbish and I didn't have the energy or the motivation to get rid of it because I was too busy using all of my energy just to eat dinner at night and not go hungry (eating disorders are greaaatttt...).
Well today I woke up earlier than usual (like 11am or so (I am working on it)) and decided enough is enough. I took all of my clothes that I was donating (around 10 bags) along with around 6 bags of rubbish to the tip and got rid of it (Went up and down stairs in the house around 10 or so times carrying everything to my car). I can move more easily in my room now, and it feels good to have donated so many clothes during a pandemic when I know people will need them. I feel tired, energyless, but good. I feel good.
I just wanted to share this to remind you that, no matter what is going on in your life, you are capable of anything. I believe in every one of you and believe that you can do anything you set your fantastic minds to. If you don't have the energy to do anything but eat, that's fine! I'm still proud of you for that!
I love you guys and hope you can find some comfort and motivation in my story from today!

Thank you for reading :) 

I will try and keep this short and sweet. 

I am heavily pregnant, a solo mum. This does not bother me, in fact I am looking very much forward to the challenge. I have 2 beautiful children already, life with them lately has been a struggle, but we always pull through with a smile and endless love. 

I have a lovely home and was able to recently do it up nicely. Something I have been dreaming about for years. 

I have a great car and all the material possessions one could ever want. I recently found joy in smoking meats on the weekend while my beautiful children play on the trampoline, we listen to music and have a great time. 

I have a very close friend who lives 2 doors down, who supports me endlessly. 

So why am I so down? Why am I anxious and having panic attacks when 2 years ago we were homeless and actually had something to be depressed about. 2 years ago I was an alcoholic, spending rent money on booze and cigarettes, I had no car or licence because I lost them drink driving. I look back now and feel sick at the person I was then.

Hi there anyone and everyone,
I was just wondering whether else here either has, or has a close connection to somebody with, both type 1 diabetes and depression? From doing a little bit of research it seems that depression is much more common in type 1 diabetics than it is for the general population, but I'm not sure why, particularly given type 1 diabetics are often in good health for many years pre and post-diagnosis. So the first question I guess is why does depression seem to disproportionately affect type 1 diabetics? People talk about the 'burden' of having to manage it 24/7, and how it can get in the way of socialising for children and teens, but surely there are much more restrictive conditions than diabetes in this regard? My hypothesis so far would be that the fluctuations in blood sugar must cause some cascading effect on body chemistry, ultimately resulting in depression? Particularly the incidence of hypoglycaemia is something that I would imagine to have a strong correlation with depression.
The destructive loop of depression --> leading to poor diabetes control --> leading to general ill-health --> reinforcing depression is fairly intuitive to me, but it also makes me feel pretty hopeless. What hope do I really have of ever overcoming this? 
With regards to day-to-day management of diabetes, I myself find that when I go low I often feel my mood take a turn for the worse (often feelings of despair, wanting to cry etc.). When my blood sugar goes high (hyperglycaemia), I often become grumpy, irritable, disgusted by the world and much more liable to snap. The last few days I've been quite high for no good reason, and I've directed anger at myself for not having better control over the diabetes (this relates to the 24/7 management burden I mentioned before). I'll skip meals as punishment or forgo things that make me happy. And I deserve it, because my depression makes me believe that. 
Also, one more thing, I find that there is some stigma associated with life-style induced type 2 diabetes. Of course stigma is unhelpful in any scenario, but it's particularly infuriating that it then gets applied to type 1 diabetics through pure ignorance. It makes me hyperconscious of how people view me and I need to explain myself whenever I mention it.
I would be really interested to hear from anyone else if they have any information, even just anecdoctal stuff, to share on these matters.

First time reach out here, really been struggling the last few months with lockdown in Melbourne,  and not being able to do any fun activities. Have a great partner and an awesome 6yo son whom i adore. But since March all ive had is going to work and coming home. 

I work in Construction and it has been massively busy, which is strnage in itself. But in the last month or so i have been constantly tired, not sleeping soundly and constantly angry. Id never harm myself or my family, but my anger i think is more directed at the current situation i find myself in, with Melbournes restrictions. Im not sure but i think it is Depression. 
I say that because im also a partner to someone with crippling Anxiety which is medicated to allow her to live a largely normal life, but when im at work, she is at home and when she is at work im at home. We are having to do this to cover home schooling. But when she is at work the house becomes untidy, as she doesnt feel motivated to keep things tidy. 

Now it is a case of i come home and spend half a day cleaning up the house before being able to relax. 

To compound it all work is busy and not really being flexible to allow me to keep up, 

I feel like im failing as a partner, father, and employee. 

Im pondering whether my own demons are coming out too, i dont talk to my parents due to a large disagreement when my son was born. I only really talk to 1 brother and have a small circle of friends. I used to always be a happy person and nothing really got to me, i want to be back in that time, i want to be happy again. I hate this feeling

I really feel underappreciated at work, and feel like i have to be there all the time as the staff under me are all largely casual labour. I struggle with managing conflict, and almost always want to run from it, my Manager always feels the need to Micro Manage me and i resent that. 

I just want to be happy and confident again

So, im new to this, to talking about feelings even though i am a big advocate for my friends and family to talk about whats going on inside their heads, alot of them either deal or have dealt with depression and anxiety and im the kind of person that will bend over backwards to help in any way i can even if i get burnt in the end. However, i dont open up much at all, im super close with my mum and sister, super close with my Nan and my Pop (who we lost at the start of the year) At the end of it, i dont like to open up to them or seek help for myself out of some stupid mentality that ""im a dude and we dont do this stuff"" and that i also just dont want to be a burden. I am also super aware of my mind and where i am, like for instance i know i need help but at the same time im like well i can deal with it myself because its not that bad surely, and as you can tell i also suck at getting my point across and tend to drag things out. Theres a thousand things id like to get out there and probably not enough words to do it so ill try and keep it short.
I dont have a relationship with my father and havent really for about 10 years, it came to light about 5 years ago that he was cheating on my mother and i, from the age of 12, were having to fight him to protect my mother and sister. i know i have some deep seeded problem with him i should address at some point but i probably wont.
Since i was 12ish i dealt with depression and self harm which didnt help things with dad, ive tried to kill myself 2 times, but i dont have those thoughts anymore and havent for a long time.
I have a constant need to be liked and accepted which is exhausting, i am a very social person and i feel like ive lost myself in this character ive created to be accepted my people that i really, dont care for but do at the same time. I also can be pretty self destructive if in a down state of mind via drinking. 
Losing my Pop hit us all very hard at, he dealt with depression and out of the whole family he was who i could talk to about things and vice versa. He was also very much the only father figure in my life and i looked up to him fondly and now hes gone i have some stupid feeling that i have to be the man in the family now, because he and i were the only males in our immediate families. I also blame my self for his death even though i know for a fact i couldnt prevent what happened (he collapsed and hit his head and couldnt make it out of the coma) but i still blame myself.
and im out, sorry.

Hi...
My husband walked out on my 2 months ago because of my mental illness and I have been getting counselling with him as well as on my own for 2 months. 2 months earlier, I was left without a job and I had been working in the same place as him. Tomorrow is my daughter's 11th birthday and my husband and his son are coming over tonight. We are a blended family but i have been in his life for over half of it. I haven't seen his son in 2 months and I am so worried at how I am going to be. I am currently being treated for BPD even though it is not the a completed diagnosis. All i do from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to sleep is cry and think about my family and how I just wish we were all together under the same roof. I try to stop thinking of the bad stuff that can go wrong but I cant help it. I havent had a good week in terms of my mental health and he just ""doesnt know"" if he is comfortable coming back home. I cant see the small steps that need to happen. Just the bigger picture and how depressed I am at the moment without them by our side. I have this guilt that I cant give my daughter anything she wants for her birthday as I am just scraping by paying for all my medical expenses. Im trying to be positive but I dont know how much longer I can do that filled in a house surrounded but things that we have built up and all their stuff as well. I have the guilt of my dad having to be here to look after me and missing out on the birth of his 3rd grandchild. I hope there is someone to talk to on this.

Hi,
Im 57 been married for 25 years, for the past 10 years our sex life has gone from being active to nothing and for the past 5 years whenever i try i get rejected, I feel she is cheating or the relationship is dead. We have discussed the issue numerous times but still i get rejected, its like we are no longer in a relationship. I feel like im being used to just pay the bills, she works part time but keeps the money mostly to herself. I am depressed and lost, i have nobody else just her. I dont know what to do anymore. Today I accused  her of cheating because she must be getting it from somewhere over the 5-10 years, either that or she hates that much that our relationship is rock bottom and finished.I have no family or friends to talk to, she was my only real friend for last 25 yrs, she talks to her mother a lot for advice. We have 1 boy 23 living away from home and 1 girl 14 still at home. Im shattered, Thanks

I have never spoken aloud about my problems as I‚Äôve always put other people ahead of me so please be kind.I‚Äôve always been to scared to speak about about how I feel as there‚Äôs others out there who need more help then me.From a very young age I feel like all I‚Äôve ever known is death heart ache and trying to be the rock who holds everything and everyone together.I was 2years of age when I lost my uncle to suicide.After that when I was around 10 I lost a family friend I called uncle to depression he didn‚Äôt commit suicide but knowing the dangers he got really drunk and rode his motorbike and passed away when he had an accident. After that I lost all contact with my father due to his substance abuse as well as abusive tendencies.I‚Äôm not sure how far anything went with his abuse as mum says he was never physical and she‚Äôs waiting for the right moment to show us her diary about her life experiences.Iwas young I don‚Äôt remember much.During high school when I was in year 9 I moved school as I started self harming. I left all my friends behind and never spoke to them again as I was to embarrassed about how I was feeling.I hated myself and my family I was very rebellious got into drugs partying and not caring about who I hurt.Leaving a path of destruction behind me I‚Äôm full of regret hurt anger and will never forgive myself for my actions.My family and friends never knew about my self harm or that I even had depression.I made suicide notes but couldn‚Äôt follow through as I couldn‚Äôt put my mum or family through that pain again.During the years of substance abuse and trying to acclimatise to a new school we lost 4 people in my year level 3 to suicide and one to a very rare ovary cancer which effects very little people let alone under the age of 50.It was a very horrible year to watch so many friends leave this earth. Let alone the devastation they left behind. After that was my uncle on dads side suicide where dad and his friend found him. This actually made me want to know who my father was again I‚Äôm not sure if it helped as I was watching dad go through the pain and never fully recover it killed me a little more inside. More recently a couple days before my birthday my auntie committed suicide due to substance abuse depression multiple personality disorder. Due to many deaths illness and issues among my family I don‚Äôt know where or how to turn for help. I know you will recommend me to a professional but I have tried to no avail.

I‚Äôve been treating my depression for 3 years now. Nothing I have done has improved my mood whatsoever. I eat well, exercise, socialise, get out of the house, Get 8 hours of sleep a night,  do ‚Äòpleasurable‚Äô activities (nothing I do actually gives me joy, but I do things other people find fun), volunteer, do self care, look after oets etc etc. every self help tip under the sun I‚Äôve done. I made a series of lifestyle changes including cutting off toxic relationships and reducing stress.  I‚Äôm now on my 4th medication, it hasn‚Äôt helped at all but I‚Äôm gonna give it a few weeks just in case. I had 10 sessions of therapy this year where I achieved practically nothing and was given no solid advice about how to cope or get better. I‚Äôve done mountains of CBT programs too. I‚Äôve tried and continue to do all of these things that are supposed to work but they don‚Äôt. If anything over the past 2.5 years I‚Äôve gone backwards. I‚Äôve got no idea how I‚Äôm supposed to cope through the rest of the year. My gp has ruled out physical causes. Everytime I ask for help people dismiss me, or tell me to keep doing what I‚Äôm doing. Clearly what I‚Äôm doing is not helpful because I haven‚Äôt made the slightest improvement in 3 years of treatment. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do. I‚Äôm just tired of people lying to me and saying things will get better, without telling me how to get there. Anyway I just need advice really. As well as honesty.

I dont know how to put this and i hope it makes sense. Im just down and out. Im feeling like everyone hates me and i am putting my self down every day. I feel alone as it feels my friends do not want anything to do with me. I hang around people and i am constantly thinking whether or not they hate me or have an issue with me, trying to please them and ensure they are happy. I have nothing to be depressed about.. i have a loving family, a roof over my head and a job. So feeling this way makes me feel like a drama queen. I feel like im not winning and just ruining everyone's day. I have  lost who i am. I just want to run away and hide and never come out. Its just hard waking up and dealing with what the day brings me. 

Thank  you for taking the time to read this.

Well, first time poster. Not really sure how this works. Been on a few different sites and nothing has really given me what I need. 
My partner, is really depressed. He has suffered depression majority of his life but has been somewhat manageable. Although he has tried to taken his life before just before we met 3 years ago and thankfully he survived. 
But recently, he has begun to sink into the same dark hole and I am trying everything I can to pull him out.. But never being to the point myself to take my own life I really can‚Äôt say I know how he is feeling or even know how to help him. 
We have a beautiful 17month little boy together and selfishly I want our family to stay together. 
Any men out there in particular that experience mental health dark days and have anything that helps them or that your partner does to support you, please share.. 
I AM DESPERATE TO SUPPORT THE LOVE OF MY LIFE...

Hi
Im a 23 years old guy, feeling depressed and alone. every morning as soon as i wake up my heart pumps faster and i start sweating and the overwhelming feeling of burden and hopelessness creeps on me. I dont look forward to the day at all. I have no friends and dont want to burden anyone w my sadness. I've learnt to mask my feelings and cover it up with jokes but i think my cover is being revealed. i used to be fun and happy with goals and ambitions, with a clear picture of where i wanted to be in the future, i had friends and had no problem making friends. but now i cant even bother and im like to myself what is the point. 
i used to be proud of myself and now i cant even go without a minute without thinking bad about myself
i dont even know what i should do, i just need someone to talk with me, and understand me
I feel sorry for myself and guilty at the same time for wasting time.  I want to get better, ive been wanting to get better for a long time, but ive always wanted to get better on my own and it hasnt worked. 
there's a negative stigma of having a mental problem in my family.

Hi guys, my name is james and i am a 17 year old yr 12 student. I have been with my girlfriend for almost 2 months now but we‚Äôve known each other for much longer before we started dating. Just before the first month of dating when bye, I was in love and loved every minute of time i could spend with her. Then i started getting these feelings and thoughts of saying i don‚Äôt love her and i was feeling numb around her. I have struggled and been diagnosed with mild OCD for about 4 years now so i realised it was something to do with that so it eventually past but would come back every so often but i knew it was my mind playing tricks on me. Now i am feeling really depressed and feel like i have no feelings towards her, i don‚Äôt get the same feeling when i see her, i keep looking at other girls and i feel so guilty and bad for that because i know i love her but i just don‚Äôt feel it i don‚Äôt even know. i care so much about her and all i want is to feel the way i used to because she deserves the best, i don‚Äôt feel like doing my normal hobbies or getting out of the house either. i just wanted to reach out because i don‚Äôt want to lose my gf

Hi! I grew up not being allowed to go to therapy or to the doctor, no matter how bad it got. My family never understood mental health illness, said I was being ""emotional"" and ""hormonal"" and to stop being rediculous. 
As you can imagine, I left my family when I was very young to go to university elsewhere. After I left them, I went a doctor and he gave me a mental health check, to which he looked me straight in the face and said ""You are the most mentally ill person I have ever met"" (thanks... doc)
I went and saw one therapist for 2 sessions and she diagnosed me with anxiety and depression, but then I stopped seeing her as I ran out of time and exams were coming up and I just didn't care about myself enough anymore. 
I had a complete mental breakdown last year and went back into therapy (about... 2 years? after my last session). I went to a different therapist, and she additionally diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, but also PTSD from past abuse, a very severe eating disorder, potential autism and dyslexia, even possible Schizophrenia. She retired last last year and I cannot work up the courage to go and dig up all my past again with another therapist. Not yet.
It should be noted, BOTH of these therapists told me to go to a doctor and get medication, but I never did. My depression told me I was useless and never going to be anything, so save the medication for someone who isn't going to be a useless lump of flesh. The thing that I needed the medication for prevented me from getting it. I have a very strong ""You are a failure"" complex that I cannot shake no matter how hard I work. 
Now, I have graduated and wasn't able to get a job before shutdown. I am living paycheck to paycheck in an extremely toxic evironment with people who hate me for being mentally ill and am terrified of myself and my own thoughts. I'm not sleeping properly, I'm not eating at all (as I write this, has been 24 hours), I need to get out but I cannot afford to. I can't even move back home with my parents (not that that would help, but it would get me out of here) as all of the borders around my state are closed and noone can get in or out due to Covid.
I have my online friends (no IRL friends, clinical social anxiety) who love and care for me, I am not fighting for myself anymore, I'm fighting for them. I don't think I am going to do anything drastic but I'm just... so tired, you know? I'm sick of the cliche ""It'll get better"". I've been suffering for half my life... when?

Today I woke up and felt that familiar feeling that many years ago I struggled to survive. The familiar heavy feeling in my body, the mind fog that literally makes me incapable of thinking clearly, the numbness and the exhausting feeling that makes me unable to do even the smallest of chores without feeling utterly exhausted half way through and unable to continue.
I hate this feeling... Being on the verge of tears, I just wanna scream. I just wanna scream and yell and tell every one around me where to go. I just wanna retreat back into myself, hide in the darkness I feel. Cry myself to sleep and be alone. 
Some days I'm sick of fighting, sick of doing all I can to keep this monster from emerging again. No one ever gets it, really understands how much I fight to keep it at bay. I pretend it's easy, it's not, it's  exhausting...

Hi
Just wondering if what was once a good distraction from the new normal of Covid Iso (Netflix) is now becoming a trigger to worsen depression at times. Watching shows reminds me of everything we used to enjoy. Little things that I didn't even think about until they popped up on a show. I never would have given any of it a second thought viewing a program before. Is anyone else experiencing this?
It was one good way of distraction before. Now I am occupying my time with online puzzles more and looking for part time work. Anything to keep busy. Very lonely and helpless feelings a lot of the time.

    My psychiatrist diagnosed me with Bipolar Affective Disorder but he didn't actually tell me until I had to get him to fill out an official form where he had to write my diagnosis and medications. It was a shock but after that settled it began to make sense. For 30yrs I have suffered from depression. I stopped taking my medications suddenly years ago and experienced a manic episode that lasted a week followed by a deep suicidal depression. I've experienced psychosis on occasion too. I thought it was psychotic depression but obviously it wasn't.
    Right now I'm confused. It's like four seasons in one day. I wake after only a few hours sleep wired and feeling euphoric , next my usual self followed by depressed then euphoric again and unable to wind down until the early hours of the morning. This has never happened before. It's been going on for two weeks now.

My husband and I have been married for 5 years and have two beautiful kiddos girl (2) and boy (4). These kids are a bigger blessing than I could have ever known. At times where I find myself hysterical locked in the bathroom and wanting to end it all i hear them knocking and calling out for me. They're never upset or scared, just curious why I'm crying, they'll take me in their arms and kiss and cuddle me saying ""remember we love you mummy!"". Exact echoes of when I find them crying and comfort them. Lately though, I've been wondering if it's enough. I hate myself so thoroughly that I feel like I'm destroying my relationship, life and potentially my children's future emotional security. I see a therapist regularly but I'm still a wreck. My husband also sees a therapist as a result of being my support person. Our relationship is tense and while I know he loves me, as he repeatedly states, and that he wants to be there to support me, I can't stop thinking about the huge financial and emotional burden I am on him. I asked him today how he felt about when I'm having and episode and his response was sad, frustrated and tired of how repetitive it is. He was not intending to be mean or hurtful. Just honest. Which I appreciate since I asked him. But ... I hate that this is something I make him feel more often than when I make him laugh, or smile, or happy. I want to go back to the relaxed, happy and confident woman I was when he met me but so much had changed. I feel so overwhelmed by the extent of my issues that I feel both the damaged it has caused to my relationship and the time it would take to become ""normal"" is essentially an impossible feat. I don't know where to start or what to do. I've contemplated disappearing. If I don't die then he can't feel guilty. It'll just be another thing I've done
After everything I know I can't express this to him so I have no idea what to do. I don't have friends and I am sometimes so desperate for human contact I feel like I'm being torn apart inside. But no one can help me, I know that. So now what? How do I keep going through this overwhelming and repetitive cycle without giving in...?

Hi,
I'm not sure what I'm hoping to achieve by writing this. Just gonna rant. 
I feel trapped. Especially at work. My workplace (tech records in aviation) is toxic. I could go on and on about exactly how and why but the issues are not going anywhere and I need to get out. I don't have any formal qualifications and with the covid situation, no-one is hiring. I don't think I can keep going like this. It feels hopeless.
I'm married and have 2 very young children whom I love dearly. My wife makes me feel a bit trapped as well. If I go anywhere she'll be hasselling me about when I'm coming home, which given the young children is understandable at the moments but has been happening before they were around and I'm sure will continue to happen once they're older. Even if I just stay up a little later than her, she says she can't sleep until I get to bed. It makes me feel like I can't go anywhere or do anything, even within my own house. I do love her but her anxiety makes her very controlling and I guess clingy is the word.
I really want to end it all but I don't want to leave my young boys without their father.

I've lived with Anxiety and Depression all my life and have been on a constant journey to find ways to manage them. Self-help books, therapy, forums, family and friends... I've turned everywhere I can think of. 

One thing that's really stood out to me has been assessing my core values. E.g. Love/Independence/Experience etc.. This is something I've read in self-help books and also have been speaking with my therapist about. The rationale behind this being so effective is that it gives you something lifelong to focus on, to live by and purpose to guide your actions in a meaningful way to you.

Sometimes we set goals with no clear importance, ones that have a clear ending. In my own experience, what I've found by doing this is that I'm satisfied only for a short time. I reach my goal (or don't reach it) and then I'm left feeling underwhelmed.. ""now what?"" I'm back to the frame of mind I was in originally. I'm searching for something more and this goal that I set for the sake of having something to do meant nothing anymore. 

When looking at your values, they will probably be different to other people AND THAT'S OK! Be honest with yourself when determining which are important to you and set them for nobody but yourself - this was something that I struggled with. Separating what you 'think' you should value and what you actually value can be a challenge, especially when society gets in your head. 

If you have a mind like mine, you may find it hard to focus on specific values and may begin to overthink. I found that taking a step back and realising that one step was better than no step helped me move forward. Although many values may be important to you, focusing on a core few will be better than circling your thoughts in need for change. The best part? You can adjust them whenever you want to.

So start somewhere and go from there. One may be a value to you simply because you find joy in it!

Tips:
- Google can be your friend. Feel free to look at lists of values to get your head around some ideas if you're stuck. But also remember that what you value doesn't need to make sense to anyone else.
- Start by setting small, achievable goals. (One of my first goals was to drink an extra bottle of water every day - very small but achievable and good for me)
- Focus on daily or weekly goals alongside your long term ones (our mind loves quick wins and it's very motivating)

If you have anything to add or you've had your own experience with this exercise, please share!

I‚Äôm having a real crappy time at the moment, depression has stuck its head back up,the feeling  loneliness and not having anyone around I‚Äôve been in tears all day pretty much crying myself to sleep through out waking up and back in tears again. 
I don‚Äôt know what brings it on, I can be good one minute/day the next I‚Äôm at rock bottom. 
I don‚Äôt  have anyone around to talk to as for friends family or so on. I just wish this shit would all just go away.

I've just spent 4 weeks at a recovery centre getting myself back to some kind of normal and feelings of worth........ Come home and the house has gone to shit...I mean really bad. UN kept, messy, bad messy and dirty. And I just lost it, went straight to the negatives saying that couldn't you guys think that maybe it would be nice for mum to come home to a clean and tidy home.... At least tidy? Why? I am not worth it, why would you? You don't care enough about me to even think about doing something nice for me. Why did I bother going through all this over 4 weeks away from my family.... What was the point.

Hi all,

I wanted to discuss the phenomena of the futureless future in specific reference to my own context.

I have been working the same dead end job for 6-7 years I am unable to find alternate employment so my career is at a dead end. By the same token my dating life and potential for a relationship is at a roadblock as well because I don't feel any pleasure during intercourse.

I feel claustrophobic, like I am surrounded by brick walls. I don't think I would be depressed if I had found some success in any of the different aspects of life. 

It seems like my life has nowhere to go and tomorrow will be another day of going through the motions.

Anyway, thanks :)

Hey guys,

First time poster here I was wondering if anyone had any tips for dealing with specific situations that cause shame and humiliation. I am currently at the tail end of a dui conviction.  I have a breathalyzer and camera in my car. It causes me shame and humiliation particularly when people have observed me using it and laughed at me. I have 40 days to go and it seems like a lifetime to me of continuing to deal with this situation. This is all occurring within a larger context of a 3 year long depression that is resistant to treatment and can't be alleviated.

Thanks for your time :)

Hi All,
I have only really talked to my gp about my mental health and am on medication. Have been for over a year now.My wife says she wants me talk to her about it all but I cant.. I have done in the past and it got thrown in my face.
Today has been a real struggle, worst it's been for a while.
I have been reading up on putting myself into a hospital and the cost side of it has put me off as we are struggling with money as it is.
Not really sure where to go from here, hoping someone could point me in the right direction?
Thanks

I have major body image issues, when I was a child I was bullied for being over weight, and for things such as hairy legs etc. My own mother use to bully me into trying to loose weight by saying things like you‚Äôll become the size of a house and my siblings would call me a pig or fat. I hate my body because of my past and I don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt like talking to others about it because everyone has plenty of other issues that are way more important, but sometimes I feel like no one care about how I feel but I‚Äôm just a burden eater. If I bring it up it‚Äôs just ignored, I listen to everyone else‚Äôs problems but I struggle to open up about mine. I hate it and sometimes it‚Äôs hard to stay positive, I wish people didn‚Äôt have to go through stuff like this it‚Äôs just crap. I see my own mothers Facebook covered in photos of my siblings but there lacks plenty photos of me and I‚Äôm ashamed of who I am, i don‚Äôt feel like I worth finding love or being happy.

Hi, 
I don't really know what to do.. Currently I'm just feeling so stressed out, depressed and completely heartbroken. I wish I could just not feel anymore. I don't know how to deal with all the emotional pain inside me, I feel like I'm drowning it it cause its all just building up and getting worse and worse cause I don't know how to let it out/go..So I just try avoid thinking and all I do is try and distract myself constantly. But it's a rubbish way to live.. 
And I've heard like that avoiding emotions/pain just makes them worse and that you need to like just acknowledge and 'sit' with them and deal with them. But how do you physically actually do that cause I have no idea how or what the even means. Cause sitting there acknowledging how heartbroken I feel doesn't help me..... 
Please if someone has some advice how to do this tell me haha..

Don't know where to turn, I just need to vent maybe more than anything or someone to hear me out. 

I just feel like I've got nothing left to look forward to. The main reasoning to this feeling is that I'm a 40yr old single woman never got to date anyone, never had kids & now there's a prospect that I'll lose my uterus as well. 
I never really wanted a great deal, just someone to settle with and start a family and I can't even achieve that! It's not like anyone would want me at this age and broken.

From when I was 18 I tried to do like so many suggested, changed jobs, kept studying, try and find a hobby.....23 years later and still the same status quo only worse possibly can't even have a kid.

A couple of years back started accepting I'd be single for good so I joined a gym. It started off great made new friends started doing things with them, I even ended up being a zumba instructor it finally looked like I had something to look forward to.  Now these past 8 months everything just seems to be crashing around me.

Last year I practically had a meltdown, which resulted in me arguing with a co worker. My workload and stress levels got so high that I had to relinquish some of my responsibilities,  which helped when starting back at the start of the year but somehow I feel like a failure. And while this was all happening my aging parents started to become me dependent of me. It was fine I guess I still had zumba and the gym.

Then covid hit!! During then covid hit!!! No gym buddies no zumba:-( which was ok cause it was lockdown.  During this time I chose to isolate for the sake of my parents while the others still kept doing activities together.  As restrictions eased I went back to the gym owner and said I was happy to start zumba instructing again. I've been told he's not going to put it on just yet (I don't think he will ever cause there's another class in its place that I can't see being dropped). So there goes another sense of failure. In the meantime all the friends I've made seemed to have lost touch with me and don't involve me anymore. I try to offer lunch or walking dates but they always seem to have something else on.

It just feels like I've got nothing else fun to do anymore. Why is it that the fun stuff is always the first to go in any situation. Sorry I know this is long & don't expect anyone to read it let alone reply. Just needed somwhere to write down 8 months worth of feelings:-(.

Hi, I‚Äôve been experiencing dramatic mood swings and anxious/bizarre behaviour for years alongside severe depression, and I‚Äôm seeing a psychiatrist soon.l
I‚Äôm just looking to ask if anyone here has bipolar 2 disorder? Do you know if changed sleep and increased activity are prerequisites for the disorder?
I‚Äôve had some sleep changes in the past, with struggling to fall asleep. But, I don‚Äôt have hugely increased energy, and definitely can‚Äôt stay up all night.
I think that I match a lot of symptoms of bipolar hypomania: I definitely get extremely restless and move from activity to activity without trying to concentrate/talk to myself out loud excessively; I reach out to people/post more in social media; I jump from feelings of interest and excitement to deep depression over the space of a few hours. I had a delusional period when I was 14. I even once woke up really early in the morning (3am!) and picked up litter in the streets a while back over a week, while talking to myself incessantly. Like, you can see why I‚Äôd feel like I may match some of the symptoms of hypomania?
I‚Äôd love to hear anyone‚Äôs thoughts, and I‚Äôm also wishing you all a lovely day üíï

I also wanted to add that my depression is all over the place: I‚Äôll have days and weeks of classic depression; then I‚Äôll have weeks of my moods shifting over hours from extreme lows to being giddy and excited. I never seem to be able to just feel neutral: I‚Äôm always mildly depressed, or struggling to concentrate and feeling excited.

Hello all, 
Basically since early May, my sleep pattern has been out of whack. I am awake during the night till about 9am then sleep till about 5pm, and the cycle continues. I think this resulted from watching a scary movie late at night (which is not something I normally do as I don't like scary movies) and maybe the experience messed up my sleep pattern. Add to the fact I am on meds for paranoid schizophrenia and depression, and it's not a happy situation. 
It is now July and I am still having irregular sleeping. Recently, I tried to keep awake till about 5pm as the plan is to sleep to about 6am and that will restart my sleep pattern. Hasn't happened yet but I'm working on it.
Recently as a result of bad sleeping cycles, I have been feeling very sad and teary for no reason. On the outside, I appear normal and well-adjusted but I guess my family/ home situation is unusual. I am a 32 year old single female who lives with my 70/71 year old parents and 30 year old autistic sister. I have no issues with mum, but my dad has been continually angry and irritable since 2013, for reasons I can't explain. Also my sister tends to be snappy (due to her condition) and she also likes to take it out on me, as if I'm to blame for her disability.
I know it's unusual for an adult to live with her parents, but I have no other relatives or friends or support where I can secure my own place, and also because I am family-less and friendless, I don't want to risk living on my own and being mentally sick, so I decide to stay with family - which I think is a common arrangement these days among people.
I think the cause of my sadness was in 2012, when my parents wanted to move into a city apartment, and because they don't allow pets, they rehomed our two cats. I was against it from the start, and insisted we stay living in a house so pets are allowed. But my parents were stubborn and had them rehomed anyway, saying ""it's my problem"" if I don't like it. Still, I think to this day, my parents secretly regret rehoming them, because it took out a significant part of the family.
I am not suicidal or overwhelmingly hopeless, but I am just upset over my irregular sleep pattern and sadness. I just feel less than human and like I don't deserve to be happy or live a normal life (as enforced by my always-angry dad).
I am considering taking anti-anxiety meds on top of my usual anti-psychotic meds and anti-depressants.

I've never felt so flat in my life, I have depression and anxiety, I've been through so much the last year it feels like it never ends, first August 2019 my brother went to jail which shocked us all, sexual assault, he now has over 60 charges when he first went to jail I was made to do everything, organise solicitors, visits, make the calls to find out why he was in jail, I felt like I was his mother because my mum is an alcoholic and just drank and drank and made me do everything, I went into a deep depression and nearly lost myself and my family, then the house we were living at for 8 years we got evicted because the owner wanted to knock the house down, so of course I had to look for a house for myself and husband and our 4 children with absolutely no money to move because it was brought on us so sudden, we finally got a house after 2 months, then i thought things could only get better from here, wrong, I had a cancer scare and we thought I had endometrial cancer, I had all the symptoms had to have ultrasounds they all come back bad, then my pap smear come back HPV positive another scare, I had to get into the hospital within 2 weeks for a biopsy, a month goes by and still no appointment, so my doctor chases it up as to why it's taking so long, I finally got an appointment, had the biopsy and had to wait 9 days for the results , results come back within 3 days. Thank God it wasn't cancer , but now I have to have surgery ( Endometrial ablation). I booked in for that 2 weeks ago so now on the wait list, then I got a phone call from my child's school that my daughter had been self-harming, that knocked me for 6 then on Saturday 4th July, my nan passed away. It just feels like it's one thing after another and I'm not getting a break. I can't seem to show any emotion , can't laugh , can't cry. I'm just flat, I'm not sleeping properly even though I'm constantly tired. I don't want to leave my house and when I think of it, my heart just pounds out of my chest.
Does anyone have any advice on how to move forward from all of this.

Hello everyone. Because of Covid-19, I have been working from home for 4 months. The first 2 months were really good, but recently I feel less movitated than usual. I have been told that we change into work from home permanentlyÔºå at least this year we will not go back to office. I live alone,  I feel extremely lonely recently. I have some social activities on weekend, but on working days, it is really hard to face myself that much.
I sleep on time, do exercise everyday, eat fresh vegetables and fruits every meal, learning a new language, writing in my first language and I am doing a great job, watch a lot of movies, and do reading regularly.But this work from home thing is too long, I feel suffocated more as time goes by. I do not what to do. How to get used to this mode? I feel vulnerable and lonely my friends.

Hello, I've never posted here before and don't really know how to start but I'm a 20yo male and have been experiencing depressive symptoms for years. I've been to headspace a couple of times but it ended up falling through (psych quit), but finally went to a GP referred psychologist on Monday.
I just feel really weak and stupid at this point, I have a couple of friends I've talked to about mental health but not in person due to the coronavirus lockdown. I want to tell my mum (live with mother and stepdad) that I think I'm depressed, but I have no clue how to go about it. I've always been quite successful academically, am in 3rd year uni, but for ages have had psych said I had a lot of depressive symptoms. Unfortunately I'm really good at hiding my emotions, and I love my mum but haven't really had any conversations relating to deep important stuff in recent years, so I have no idea how to start. I've also been abusing drugs which makes it a lot harder to talk to my parents as it's not something im proud of but I don't want my mum to be disappointed in me. I just don't want to feel like I'm alone even though I live in my house with my family, does anyone have any tips for how to talk to her about it? It's also hard because I have a little brother and wouldn't want to talk to her about it in front of him, and he's awake until about 8pm everyday.
 
Thanks, I hope anyone who reads this has a great day : )

Whos taken the fake it to you make it approach with depression? I have probably had an episode since 2018, tried a treatment in hospital last December didn't work, found out it could be because my depression has bipolar elements and people like myself don't respond aswell to it. So I am in a limbo sort of state, I sort of know that I am not right, but going the route of getting back into working , despite this, which I find kinda funny as I feel semi functional. I am lucky to have another treatment on the horizon if need be, and that proves to be helpful to many people. I have friends, family but things like making dinner sometimes seem like a bigger chore then they need to be (thats just one example at times like this). I took medication the other night to quell the irritability and I didn't crack it at my family when I felt I might, thank you medication. Anyways cheers

I am lost as to where I can go to get help.
I have found it very difficult to see a GP in my area.   I have been to a number of psychology services, that I have engaged personally and a through my employers wellbeing service and found these of no value, in fact found them to make me feel worse.
I am full time employed and changes that are occurring at work are creating challenging environment as I personally don't agree with some of the changes and if I am open about my opinion I am judged and feel verbally harassed.   I am not wanting to go to work anymore but have nothing else to fall back on.  Talking to colleagues and my manager is not an option.
I live alone and don't have a huge social network and I find it very difficult to get motivation to get out and about.
Whilst I have the worst thoughts, I don't consider myself a high risk of suicide as I also reflect on what suicide will mean to family and the impact it will have on others who know me.
I am looking for what has worked for others that have found them selves lost and the normal help services not working for you.

Hi, 
so I‚Äôm making my first thread. - feel very scared. 
The past few years nothing has changed. I feel so empty now that I‚Äôm feeling like what‚Äôs the point anymore. 
I go to work (full time) - yep pays the bills but I‚Äôm getting to a stage that I hate the place. That no one appreciates me in the workplace. People say shit to me and I start crying. 
I go home every night - cook dinner watch my show and go to bed. I sit on my phone every day and think no one is messaging me. And when I message people it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs an effort for them to even reply. 
But don‚Äôt get me wrong I live with my sister and it‚Äôs great. 
I‚Äôm single - I have my struggles with men. They always tend to ghost me. And I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm so needy and lonely. That when someone gives me attention I love it and don‚Äôt to leave it. Because it doesn‚Äôt happen often. 
Not sure what happens after I post this. 
but really felt like I needed to speak out for once. 
I‚Äôm always crying and Feel like I need help.

I‚Äôm tired, I really am. 
Its been years since I fell in love with my best friend. I‚Äôve told her this in the past and got rejected. 
We didn‚Äôt talk for a while. 
We are now best friends again. We‚Äôre close. Very close. 
I love her more than I did before yet she doesn‚Äôt. Sending me spirally down the path of depression again. 
Nothing ever works for me. Not relationships, not my work and not life in general. Above all, it‚Äôs her that that kills me.
Wish I could just end it all. 
Wish I was more attractive and taller that would help her see me more than a friend. 
The jealousy of seeing her with other people kills me. I know she talks to other people but she never talks about it with me. I think she knows it would hurt me. 
Im tired of crying, not sleeping and probably will turn into an alcoholic with the copious amounts of drinks I have each night to numb the pain and to forget. 
I wish someone would tell her how we could be great together because she clearly doesn‚Äôt see it. 
I apologise for the rant. Just needed to let it out, for once.

I‚Äôve been depressed and anxious for most of my life, but right now it‚Äôs really bad. In addition I had chronic pain for the last 13 years. The strange thing is that there‚Äôs nothing wrong; in fact, our circumstances have improved recently. This doesn‚Äôt seem to matter to my depression, though.
Over that past 35 years I have tried almost everything. Often the new drug, diet or exercise seems to work, but it never lasts. The only thing that really helps me is my current medication: my pain lessens and I feel great and confident. However, when it wears off around 3PM, the crash is so horrible, that I dare not take it anymore.
I don‚Äôt think I have actually asked a question above, but I just wanted to share this.

Ok, my first post
I know what‚Äôs ‚Äòwrong‚Äô, I know my ‚Äòstory‚Äô, I know all the helping techniques and therapies and meds... I‚Äôve tried them all... really committed to them... over 10 years
I can‚Äôt break free... from my own head, my own thoughts... it feels selfish and self-centred... so many people are so much worse off than me... yet I feel like there is no reason and nothing to my life...
even with four beautiful children... even with a good job... even with wanting, really wanting to get better
it‚Äôs a disease, it‚Äôs ingrained and hard wired from my childhood... I wasnt abused...  I was abandoned...  always wanting someone to love me... unhealthily clinging to anyone in adulthood... putting up with so much mistreatment only to feel loved... not loving myself
self love feels impossible to me, even self like
using alcohol and drugs to escape the pain... to feel ok, if only for a fleeting moment, before feeling a million times worse
im sober now, for quite some time... it feels worse
i feel so unloveable, so broken, so hopeless
i know everyone will say just hang on... do this... do that... put yourself out there, make friends, be mindful, try yoga, use SSRIs or SNRIs... it will get better... it takes months or years to rewire your brain...
ive done all that... it doesn‚Äôt
i don‚Äôt want sympathy, I don‚Äôt want someone to say I understand
i want to know something that works... something that cuts through this hurt... this deep searing, tormenting hurt

Hi so I've been depressed for about half my life but. Recent I've been experiencing what I thought could be Mani or hypomania in between periods of depression. But I didn't stress too much over it BC I just thought maybe I was starting to feel better and was having some good days.

But the a week ago I all of the sudden felt like I'd taken cocaine, I was so hyper and not thinking before talking and would get obsessed with any task I was doing or couldn't keep my mind on anything at all. I tried some slightly harder drugs for the first time (which I'm usually very against) and almost booked a holiday (and would have if my boyfriend was available to check dates with) I spent $700 over 2 days (which for me is huge) and after all that stuff I kinda realised what was going on and while I was still in an insanely good mood and super hyper, I was able to talk myself out of SOME  of my impulsive behaviours.

Anyway so I've still been feeling this way for a week and haven't slept in over 48 hours and have still been doing usme kinda weird stuff.


So yeah idk this is a first for me.... And while it's been so much fun, I'm scared of the danger I'm putting myself in and the stigma that surround bipolar disorder (if that is what this is). Soooooo yeah can anyone who has been through this give me any tips or anything .... Or just a friend to vent to. (Btw I am going to see my go and psychologist about this next week)

Hey I am new here,
My depression is really winning right now. I am feeling numb and unmotivated. I got a major asssement due tomorrow and I've already had 4 extensions on it. Yet I still cannot do it.
I am comfort eating and being lazy more than ever and it shows. 
Right now, I literally hate who I am physically and mentally.
I am so tired of being a burden to my friends which is why I am here. If I didn't have kids who knows where I'd be...

I think that i'm bipolar and i don't know what to do.
Mid way through last year my family caught on that i was feeling really bad about myself and not wanting to do anything so I went to a counsellor and they said that it was most likely that i was dealing with depression and sent me to go to a therapist. Others things came up and i ended up not going. I felt bad like this for a while but then I just started feeling a lot better, more energetic and generally happy. I never though much of it and just assumed that it was just because it was something that had happened and I had gotten over it. I made a lot of commitments to partaking in sport and other activities during this time and was basically ready to do anything. Then later on that year i was hit with another phase of depression once again feeling terrible as well as not wanting to go outside at all or spend time with others and therefore braking the commitments I had previously made and been confident I would fulfil. During this time I was extremely lazy and unmotivated, causing failure in most aspects of my life. I felt worthless and went through a period of contemplating suicide and self harm.
Over the past month I have been really energetic after feeling blue before and into quarantine. For a while I have had a feeling that I had had bipolar or some similar issue but today when i lashed out at those around me for no apparent reason i am realising that there is definitely something going on and I need to stop it before I hurt someone or myself. Looking back on it I can't count the amount of similar situations where i have just lost control of my mood and unnecessarily attacked someone verbally. 
I feel lost and am unsure on what to do. I found these forums whilst learning about mental health at school.
Hopefully i did this right :)

I have no idea what these forums are all about.
I have nothing in common with anybody here.
I never went to uni.
Never ran a business.
Never been a manager.
Highest salary I ever had was 50 thou.
I never married or had kids.
I live alone, don't have many friends (only 4 good friends including my sister).
I've never been overseas.
The last sexual relationship I had was in 1987.
I can't make things or play music or anything.
I am a 65 y/o man.
I sometimes try things to fit-in and then fool myself into thinking I actually belong
but sooner than later I realise I don't and then have to pull out. 
Please don't tell me to take up bowls or ballroom dancing.

I am a 29 years old male, single,
turning 30 this year and I still live with my parents. I have a full time job. Been
working at that job for 4+ years (I‚Äôm an office clerk), but I don‚Äôt make enough
to be able to afford rent. I‚Äôve recently completed a Certificate III in IT from TAFE, and
I‚Äôm in the process of trying to find a better job in IT. I‚Äôve been trying to
find a new job in IT for the last 6 months but haven‚Äôt had any success, due to
a lack of experience in the IT field. 
Seriously, it‚Äôs infuriating and embarrassing for me.
My parents keep telling me that
its OK for me to stay at home with them, and as far as I know they don‚Äôt seem
very interested in helping me become more self-sufficient, so I‚Äôve been taking
steps to achieve my goal of being self-sufficient by myself (by learning to cook my own
meals, manage my own finances etc.) but my mother keeps cooking food for me
even though I tell her that I would like to try and learn to cook by myself. Don‚Äôt
get me wrong I love my parents and I‚Äôm not blaming them for my predicament, but
they seem to have a ‚Äúhelicopter parents‚Äù vibe to them.
I almost feel like running away
to a Homeless Shelter or something just to leave my parents‚Äô
house. What‚Äôs your advice?

Hi everyone this is my first post on here in a long time. 
 Im really struggling with my depression at the moment. I have been dealing with it on/off for years now but I am currently having my worst bout since the start of 2016. I think it might be everything that is going on in the world at the moment just hitting me all at once as well as my personal issues. I am very much in a position where I am just really struggling with day to day life and see no purpose in it anymore. I broke down in the toilets at work today its the first time its happened in the near 6 years I have been at my current job but even that I can't deal with anymore. Honestly all I want to do is sleep since its basically the only thing that gives me any sort of joy at the moment and everything else is just a huge chore. Even after I got home from work this evening I went into my room and cried my eyes out again 2nd time that has happened in the space of a week. I should note I have had a change in duties recently and I am really struggling to deal with it and really don't know how to address it at work but I think its a massive reason that kick started my depression this past week. I find it really hard to open up to people in person but find it much easier to open up on forums and threads like this. Sorry if this got a little too personal I just needed somewhere to vent since I even struggle to open up to my parents with whom I still live with and if I do I would probably just break down in tears again.

I'm almost 30. Don't get me wrong i love my grandparents dearly.
But every week I help my mum out shopping with them. 
I get mad because  my parents guilt trip me into helping. Because I have nothing better to do. 
I would rather be out ibushwalking instead and enjoying my life, before I get goo. 
I'm just mad. That I'm kinda force into it. Then afterwards my mum goes and has a rest while I'm sitting home bored.

Hi,
I have been feeling really really down lately and I'm not sure who to talk to. This whole year has been really tough on everyone and at the moment I'm having a hard time going back to how i was feeling before lockdowns and everything going out of control. At the beginning of the year I was feeling pretty confident, I had so many plans for things I wanted to achieve this year like make new friends and spend more time with people in my life, find a new job in my field, possibly find a relationship. It's been very difficult to do any of these and I feel like I've completely lost my confidence and motivation to even try now and I just feel unhappy, lonely and not like my usual self at all. I never was a super confident person to begin with so now that all this has happened I feel like a complete mess and like I'm stuck in a black hole.
Before covid I was seeing this guy and we were seeing eachother a bit when lockdowns first started. We were getting along so well but stopped because it was difficult with the restrictions. He started talking to me again recently and I was pretty excited to hear from him, but things felt so different like we werent talking as effortlessly and when I went to hang out with him it felt more awkward like I didn't even know what to say. He hasn't talked to me since we hung out now and I feel like it's because my social skills have gone so bad from the isolation that of course he wouldn't want to be around me.
I wish I knew what to do to gain my confidence back I just feel so stuck and awful right now and I feel like I can't even see people because I'm so much of a mess that it will make me feel even worse. Someone please help

A few years ago my mother attempted suicide. Since then I have been dealing with immense guilt. Everyday I walk around knowing I'm not enough to make her want to live and I know it's selfish to think like that but I can't help it. No matter what I do now, it all feels pointless, I feel pointless. Nothing, including me, feels real or important anymore. I tried talking to a councillor at school about it but she didn't help. I can't talk to my mother about it as she already has enough on her plate. I can't tell my friends about it as I don't want to burden them with my baggage. I just need someone to talk to. Every time I see her face I feel guilty, I think about all the things I could possibly have done to make her want to stick around a bit longer. I've contemplated suicide myself but I could never do it to her or the rest of my family. I'm not mad at her for what she did, or rather, tried to do. I'm mad at myself for not doing anything, though I'm not sure I could have done anything at the age of 13. I don't feel real anymore...

Do other people feel physically ill when they are depressed?

I don‚Äôt exactly know if what I am feeling is classified as depression or if I am being over dramatic. 
For a long time now I have had negative thoughts about myself when I am sad/upset or having a bad day. I think that I am ugly, fat, useless, stupid and I am a burden to everybody. Everything just hits me all at once.
Most of the times I cry my eyes out to the point they are red and puffy, I listen to sad songs feeling so numb and broken my heart literally feels like it‚Äôs dropping. I have thoughts of suicide all the time when I am sad (but not actually attempt it as I am scared of the pain) I find myself writing goodbye notes to my family hoping it will help me/make me feel better.
 I feel so much hurt and sadness to the point I think everyone would be better off if I was gone or that I was not born. 
I so badly want to talk to someone about it but it‚Äôs hard trying to express myself, I feel like they may not understand or might even judge me. I can‚Äôt even talk to family about it as I am too embarrassed. 

I just need advice on what I should do because I hate these feelings and don‚Äôt want to feel them anymore.

Greetings and Salutations,
I haven't posted before, however I do find reading other threads helpful, thank you.  It encourages me to speak out too.
Please excuse my post if it's all over the place, as I'm not sure where to start.  I'm not even sure what I'm looking for!!!  I guess, I'm just taking a step to to seek support in more ways than one.
I've recently returned to seeing my psychologist, who believes I may have Bipolar 2.  I'm going to continue seeing her on a regular basis (thankfully, it is bulk-billed).  I'm also being referred to a psychiatrist - to discuss this further, and may have to go on medication.  That scares me --- I'm afraid the medication will make me physically sick.   But after speaking to friends and extended family, I'm open to anything at the moment as I feel like I need something to kickstart me into healing properly. I haven't been eating well and have lost a lot of weight.  I know all the things I need to do, but I struggle to do them.
What is breaking my heart is that I feel like my husband and children have deserted me, because of my poor mental health.  My husband has attempted to support me in his own way.  I can imagine he is worried and I can understand he is doing the best he can.   
My communication is quite poor and I know I need improvement in this area.  I find it hard to speak, so instead I wrote a long letter to my family apologising for my poor mental health, assuring them I am seeking help.  The thing is, in the past, I have tried to do this on my own and convince myself I'm okay.  Clearly, I'm not.  I feel like they've given up on me.  Which is also understandable, as I often give up...
Before I 'lose my temper', I feel convinced it is justified.  I have reason to get pissed off. I live quite an alternative lifestyle.  My said hubby doesn't have a regular job, but rather does what he wants when he wants.  I have a business from home that takes up a lot of my time.  People around me aren't surprised I've lost my mind living with him.  He himself is all over the place, but is convinced he's altogether.  So much so, he has convinced our children (and me over and over and over again) that 'there's something not right with Mummy.  she needs help'.
I had a serious car accident when I was a toddler, which I have always lived with and presumed was okay with, but now am feeling this trauma has affected me and contributed to my 'mental damage'.
Anyway, I just wanted to reach out.  
Thank you for taking the time,

Everyone is an individual, but here is the challenges that I undertook post correct diagnosis. Here below is references to help you cope with bipolar 2. (Topics in bold you can put in the search bar to read- just read the first posts)

Acceptance- some of us get all emotional when it dawns on us that we will take meds for the rest of our lives. It‚Äôs not that bad. Acceptance- is this our biggest challenge?


 Part of YOU- bipolar is a part of you as are your limbs and your character. 
    Motivation- it plays a big part because others will over criticise you.  Feeding your brain
 Guilt- You won‚Äôt ever get rid of it but like everything with bipolar, reducing it helps. Guilt the tormentor
 Relaxation- Another way of caring for yourself. Meditation- words of wisdom- he helped me for 25 years
 Sensitivity- You won‚Äôt get rid of this either but you can improve it. Also don‚Äôt feel guilty about it. Again it‚Äôs part of YOU. Words are stick and stones
 Expectations- We crave support. It‚Äôs normal to want it. However giving it to an invisible illness challenges our loved ones. This forum fills a void.. ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù people will not understand
 Non professional interference. Seems everyone around us is an expert. Yet it takes one to be a GP then many extra years of study to be a psychiatrist. You‚Äôll need to counter these people. Defend yourself! Wit/ the only answer for torment and Fortress of survival (plus part 2) and Vulnerable- be ready to defend
 Support. You can get it here on this forum, support groups and reading/research This bipolar life
 Suicidal thoughts. They might come around. Remember, tomorrow they may not be there. They arrive like an unwanted visitor. Avoiding suicidal thoughts or intent and Suicidal thought and choices and Saving yourself from doom
 Rejection- you‚Äôll lose friends, even family. You‚Äôll close ranks and turmoil is something you‚Äôll have to cope with. Disowned by family members- how to survive it
 Anger. You might find you can be explosive. Introducing ways to quell it is beneficial. Anger- can you own it? 
    I hope these guidelines on coping with bipolar help you. Please feel free to discuss them or add to them

Have been diagnosed with major depression for quite some time now and just feel like giving up. Will this ever get any better
My family all call me a sook and that there‚Äôs nothing for me to be depressed about and I need to get over myself. I have no friends to talk to this stuff about as they bully me about my mental health and just generally don‚Äôt seem to care.
Just so confused in life have no idea what to do, just want to move away and hide forever.

Hello, this will be my first time doing something like this so please bare with me. 
I don't really know how to label this feeling, whether I'm actually depressed or if I'm just being over dramatic. 
I've just felt so pressured. My parents don't love each other. They were going to divorce when I was just born but my mum has a factory work job and begged my dad to stay for me and my brother. So he did, but my dad hates my mum and brother and only loves me. I know it's selfish of me to say that his love is burdening, but every time I talk with him it's like I'm walking around glass. He gets angry easily, he's always shouting, and I have to calm him down. And whenever I say something that he doesn't like, he'll start threatening me. ""I'm only here because of you, if you don't like me then I'll just leave."" It's suffocating, having to fake how I act around him, even the simplest of things upset him to the point of ignoring me for weeks, each day of silence scaring me that he will leave.
And my parents have always pressured me about school. But my grades have gotten worse, and they are disappointed in me. I understand why, since I'm such a disappointment. They would shout at me when I was a kid for bad grades. I never got to hang out with my friends or play. What was the point of all the tears I shed if I was going to end up with terrible grades anyways?
One day a few months ago I had what I think was a panic attack at home in front of my parents. They were shouting at me again, and I couldn't stand the shouting it made me feel so afraid and weak and suddenly I was screaming and crying. It felt like I was dying. And I thought that my parents would care, they'd feel sorry for me, they'd comfort me. But they only screamed louder. They asked me why I was screaming and I said I was stressed from school but they called me a liar. ""Everyone is stressed you're not special"". ""you're just weak""
And I guess I was. When I think about everything I'm the reason for my own sadness. If I were smarter, if i could deal with stress my parents wouldn't be angry. If I was a better daughter, a better person I wouldn't feel this useless. Whenever I feel sad which seems to be all the time lately, I can't help but blame myself. I hate myself so much. For everything I've done. For being useless and weak for being pathetic, for crying, for being stupid, for being too dramatic. I wish this feeling would go away but it's been here for weeks and i feel like I'll never get out

Hi. It took me about 15 minutes just to figure out what to write and where to start. To anybody looking from the outside into my life they would say it‚Äôs a great life. I have a beautiful healthy baby boy and an amazing wife. But the last 12 months have been an exhaustive and character changing mental battle. I have found myself slip deeper into negativity and just tired of the daily routine. Things that I used to love to do just don‚Äôt bring me that satisfaction anymore. I carry a weight of sadness and frustration constantly.  I love my wife and son with all my heart but I am constantly carrying a guilt that because of the way I feel and how it affects me that I‚Äôm not being the husband or father I should be. I do have a highly stressful and demanding job but at this point in my life it‚Äôs what I need to do to get me and my family ahead in life financially. I moved interstate a few years ago and left my life behind (friends, family) and as much as that move was what I needed at that time in my life and I was able to get married and start a family in my new home,  I have struggled to make it my home. I grew up in a broken family, parents separated when I was an early teen and i never realised until now just how much of an affect those years had on my life. When I reflect on things I actually can never pin point a time my father said he was proud of me or loved me. In fact growing up I was always compared to family friends kids and highlighted that I was not where they were at in my life. I specifically remember a time when at age 13 my dad stopped coming to my soccer games because he would say that I wasn‚Äôt good enough. So self worth and confidence has always been a struggle for me. In my early adult life it wasn‚Äôt a problem because I would mask it with drugs, alcohol a fake macho persona and ‚Äúhaving a good time‚Äù. But now that I am a father and a husband I am really starting to feel those wounds. I‚Äôm tired of this daily struggle and daily mental battle.

Thanks for clicking and taking the time to read my story.

I have been struggling with depression (on and off) for 12 years. I am 23 now and am sick of it!
It started in school whilst my parents were fighting everyday and using me as an emotional punching bag.
Despite this I did well in school and believed in myself.

Then in highschool a ""friend"" bullied me for 3 years. It was intense, physical assult, daily emotional taunting, it left me dreading school. At this point my parents were separated and I was living with my sister and Dad, whilst not getting along with my Mum.

My general attitude was, I'm strong enough to deal with this on my own. This was the general advice from my Dad. This resulted in me never reaching out to my best friend, school councillor, teachers, etc.
This attitude followed me to when I was raped by a ""loving"" boyfriend. Again, I did not tell my best friend, parents, sister, etc. (5 years ago)

Now I am in the position of having no friends, I am struggling to complete my university course (I love what I am studying, however this same attitude prevents me from reaching out for help when I need it).
I turned this around this summer after a great work experience program where I got tonnes of support. Untin Coronavirus....

Coronavirus forced me to move back home for the past 3 months and I've never made such a big mistake!

It was such a toxic environment, that I couldn't complete my studies online and I'm not certain if I'll be allowed to continue with my work experience program.
I feel so lost and frustrated. I don't have anyone I can turn to for support and I need to plan how to procede. 

I will go back to the city and prepare for my studies next semester. My main concern is how I am dreading going back, as I have no support/friends there. I have taken steps to talk to potential friends in my city and it looks promising. However I still have the issue of my depression. It has effected every aspect of my life!!!

Plan of action so far....

I need a support group in Perth with people who understand me! I need to speak to the councillors at uni and explain how it's effected my studies. I need a psychologist to acknowledge and address my past experiences so I can stop thinking about them as issues (the bullying, the rape, the fear I have of opening up to people).

My goal from therapy is to build a support network for myself in Perth!
Please someone provide some guidance! I would very much appreciate it!

Hi - I have spent the day feeling very sad and crying and eating ice cream to feel better. My housemate is moving out after 3+ years here - on great terms - just time for her get on with her life somewhere else. I will miss her and her arrival and presence has been very important for me. 
She moved in 3 months after my husband of 20 years surprisingly abandoned me (no warning, just ""i'm off"" and literally walked off not to be seen / heard from again/ refusing to talk). I was in the grieving cycle and she moved in. A lovely role model of working hard, fit and healthy, nicely groomed and dressed etc. Shared life stories, shared meals, shared our lives for 3 years. I described her as Mary Poppins. 
It is totally normal to feel sad about such a situation. Although it triggers all the life / family issues. I have had several bouts of clinical depression in my life, grew up with a mother with schizophrenia, my father has admitted that they didn't have the resources to look after me and they thought I was smart, so they left me to my own devices without any guidance. abusive, jealous older sister with whom I now do not have a relationship. She was the one who constantly criticised everything / degraded / minimised everything - told me I was wrong. Still does now. 
I have read ALL of the books. years of therapy. been on anti-depressants. I know about neurology, exercise, diet, meditation, psychology. and here I am again. 54. alone. the pandemic put my job at threat and cut my pay by 50%. after my divorce cost $ and left me with a mortgage. Can't afford retirement.  I feel tired, tense, nothing is good enough, no matter what I try - no nice endings so why start, .... all those things
so I came here - to try and help myself. I intellectually know that I am not being abandoned again. I'm not even sure what I am asking here? How do I help my neurology to stop freaking out with the old childhood beliefs and act like the world is coming to an end again? I so tired of living 50 years in this space.

Hello
i haven‚Äôt posted before and don‚Äôt know if this is the right online forum to share these thoughts and feelings... so apologies in advance if I should be on another one!
i was married for 11 years to a wonderful man and have two beautiful children. We recently separated. It was my decision in the end but in reality I feel he stopped loving me long before that. 
I developed post natal depression after the birth of my first child. And depression has been my constant companion ever since. I take medication. Which sometimes works ie I don‚Äôt feel rock bottom and other times I wonder if I‚Äôm on a plesibo. 
I have lived alone now for 9 months and have shared cared of our children. I work in a highly stressful job which consumes at least 50 hours of actual work and same again in stress and mental gymnastics. 
I have complicated work relationships with my work colleagues - due mostly I think if I‚Äôm being honest to my constant mood swings. I take my loneliness, disappointment and anger out on them. Which I get angry with myself for. Had one such week last week and Friday was the worst where I left the office in tears. 
then a full melt down about all the things in my life that were wrong or missing. 
I don‚Äôt have many friends. Over the years they have all withdrawn and pulled away. Most recently two of the friendships I valued the most cut me off. 
When I don‚Äôt have the kids I can go from Friday to Monday not talking to another person. Locked in my head. And while my work is so intense that I crave rest and downtime when I get it it just feels like an endless gaping hole. 
I started seeing someone that I fell hard for during the breakup of my marriage. His marriage broke up too. Long story but it‚Äôs been complicated. We broke up 6 months after it started cause he just didn‚Äôt want a relationship (or one with me I don‚Äôt know...). Since then because we‚Äôve been friends we‚Äôve drifted into this friends and sex thing. It sounds superficial maybe but it‚Äôs not. There are real feelings. He says he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to raise my expectations‚Äù whenever I bring up a possible future. I see him once a fortnight and it‚Äôs all he wants. 
I tried online dating. But it ended in a situation I don‚Äôt really want to say but it left me feeling shame and self loathing. 
im so incredibly lonely and so empty. I don‚Äôt know how to get out of this hole. I‚Äôm going back to my doctor cause maybe i need medication reviewed. 
I don‚Äôt have a question. Wanted to know people are out there. And I‚Äôm not alone

Hi Guys 
i‚Äôm not to sure what I‚Äôm looking for here maybe just to get some validation that what I‚Äôm feeling is normal 
over the past year I have been feeling very down and had thoughts that there is no point living anymore. Everything started to slowly return to normal until o had a car accident, not my fault someone came out right infront of me. Long story short my car was written off. Ever since I have suffered strange feelings like nightmares, inability to sleep, eat & feeling restless and getting angry easily 
people have told me I‚Äôm suffering from PTSD but I‚Äôve never had that before so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm feeling. The horrible thoughts are returning and I‚Äôm feeling very low again 
Hoping some people can maybe point me in the right direction as to how to try and get through this 
thanks

I‚Äôve never posted anywhere like this at all, but it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I genuinely feel I have no one else to talk to. I‚Äôve always been too embarrassed to open up to anyone about my mental health and I struggled to even admit it to myself, I guess because I‚Äôm scared people will see me differently. Idk what I‚Äôm expecting from this, or if anyone will see this or reply, but I‚Äôm just going to write out what I‚Äôm struggling with because I don‚Äôt know what else to do.
I think my ‚Äòdepression‚Äô (I‚Äôm not diagnosed or anything but idk what else to call it) started after my parents split up. My Dad was emotionally abusive and borderline physical. About a year after the messy, contested, and honestly traumatic divorce, dad repartnered and moved in with his new gf after knowing her for about 2 months and without even introducing her to me, or my little brother or sister. Ive tried to maintain my relationship with my dad even tho I‚Äôm the only one who makes the effort and despite having to live with her as a consequence, making that so emotionally straining for me. She yelled at me once when she overheard a conversation between my dad and I about how I was uncomfortable having to live with her, and dad didn‚Äôt stand up for me, and I haven‚Äôt gone back to their house since. He hasn‚Äôt tried to get in contact with me since then. It feels like he‚Äôs choosing his new girlfriend over me, his daughter. That moment broke my heart, and he doesn‚Äôt seem to care.
¬†
¬†
I also have literally one close friend. One of my best friends of over 10 years has chosen to cut me off, and my best friend of the past 3 years has decided it would ‚Äòbe best if we didn‚Äôt see each other one on one.‚Äô These 2 girls have formed a group with a few other girls from my year level that really don‚Äôt like me, and it feels like I‚Äôm being cut off from my best friends and excluded from a friendship group at the same time. As a result I‚Äôm basically completely alone and have no friends.
I have basically no one, but the one best friend I do have also happens to be my ex, who I‚Äôve recently fallen back in love with. I‚Äôm so dependant on him for my happiness and it‚Äôs so messed up bc no one deserves that. I‚Äôm trying to get over him bc he‚Äôs made it clear he‚Äôs fully over me but how am I supposed to get over someone when they‚Äôre the only person I‚Äôm spending my time with?
Idk there‚Äôs so much more but there‚Äôs a character limit and I think I‚Äôve already passed it.
Please help me I don‚Äôt know what the point is anymore.

I would like first to say hello to everyone, hope you are all safe. I am alone. I have no family, nor any friends. Anxiety and depression are severe and make it difficult to relate to anyone. Whilst relief teaching I was able to cope with being alone as the interaction was enough. I am not able to do that anymore with the present crisis so I am constantly at home. My living situation is unpleasant and adds to the isolation. I have tried many things over the years, from psychiatrists, psychologists, men's groups, therapy groups and more. All have been failures for me. I do not relate well to others as I feel judged always. I know this is not always the case, however, it is real all to often. I am safer alone, but not from myself. I do wish that I could relate to someone. I have come close to deleting this post. Just lonely.

Hi I am a new member looking for support because I am really struggling at the moment. I feel heavy all the time and I'm getting really tired of being tired. I can't find anything to make me happy and it always feels like I'm watching myself through a movie screen. How are you coping with your depressive moods because I'm running out of ideas. Every single day is a complete battle with myself to be happy and fun around my peers and friends but I am getting so tired. I'm young and I just want to start living my life. I feel like I'm walking up a hill and every time I think I'm at the top, there's more to climb. Please share your experiences.
Thanks for reading, Ruby :)

Hi, I am new to this forum and new to depression. I was recently diagnosed with depression. It has been an extremely confusing journey for me, I didn't and still don't know if I am depressed or just a horrible person. To most I am bubbly and happy and I have no idea how I got to this point, I am booked in to see my GP about my care plan and seek counselling to get to the bottom of it. In the past I have tried with counsellors but flake out after a few sessions as I felt like it wasn't helping me, but I guess that's probably part of my problem. I noticed a change in my moods and tirdeness about 2 years ago and was diagnosed with Hashimoto's (slow thyroid) with no other usual symptoms other than being exhausted all the time. About 2-3 weeks ago I was referred to a psychiatrist and prescribed an antidepressant. Since starting the medication (yes I am aware of the side effects that may make you feel worse) I have spiralled completely. I have one good day to two really awful days. I mostly snap irrationally and rage at very small decisions or something my partner has asked, which I don't usually do to this extent and I can't calm myself down. I take it out on my partner and scream at him that I hate him and I don't care about him or the kids, which is a complete lie. He can't take it anymore and has taken me to hospital twice this week. He is sick of me and I know this is taking its toll on his wellbeing. What's worse is that I cannot explain to him or apologise afterwards and my 'sorrys' are falling on dead ears and are never good enough, I don't blame him though. He filmed me raging out and having a breakdown which set me off completely but he said its for his own safety and to show me later on how bad I really am. I haven't been physical but I have been breaking things. I can't see me getting better and I feel like I am about to lose everything. Has anyone experienced anything like this and how did you push through? Thank you.

Hi guys, going through a pretty dodgy patch mental health wise, so very irritable at people, at problems, today it was at myself, I think really alot of it is my mood but I take some of the responsibility. But yeah hoping the next few months pick up because things havn't felt too pretty.  I'm gonna try and keep things basic, go to bed at set times, live a more ordered life, I think the problem with my body is stress and from what I know cortisol with people with mood disorders, you have to keep it in check. I've been between work which isn't great for mental health as many people know but I've been trying to get something through a job agency that is manageable, that has been a bit tricky judging my own capabilities , anyways there are a few good opportunities so hopefully I can sort that soon. Anyways all the best to everyone

Hi All
i am new around this forum and the topic of depression, however I would like to firstly thank everyone in the community for all the info available it has helped me understand and cope with my situation greatly. Secondly I would like to tell my story.i have recently been to my GP (a big deal for me) because I felt very stressed and angry All the time. It has been affecting all aspects of my life. I have had several major issues happen in my personal and work life that have caused me to feel this way.i spoke to my doctor briefly about my issues and feelings, he has diagnosed me with depression and started me on anti-depressants. Before I went to the Doctor I did not think I had depression however now after being more informed and researching depression I do think I have some type of depression. I feel more angry and hopeless in my situation than sad though. I do have a lot of the symptoms of depression but am more angry than sad. I have not been happy for a long time.¬†I felt better the first week after going and talking to the doctor about it and starting the Anti- depressants. I have not been sleeping properly for a long time now and have been smoking pot to help me relax take my mind of things and sleepThis was all OK or so I thought until I had a smoke last Sunday night after tea and went positive on a drug test at work 12 hrs later. I have been stood down for a week now waiting a decision to see if I keep my job. I will say that I have never been to work stoned, don't smoke before or at work. Anyway this has had a big impact on my mental well being.i have been a long term user of pot and now I do wonder if this has caused some of my problems, anyway I have now stopped.i am going back to my GP this week and will discuss the smoking pot, also a follow up on the anti-depressant, which I don't think are working yet. He has advised seeing a physiologist which I think I will now as I feel I need to talk to someone about my situation and feelings. I think this will help.This has all been a big deal for me I have never had much to do with depression or mental illness. Like I said this site has helped me a heap as I feel a bit alone with this. I told work I started taking Anti-depressants but feel that they don't understand my situation at all and now testing positive for pot has just made it all worse.
Anyway I just wanted to tell my story, vent a little and say thanks to everyone for understanding and helping in this community. i do feel better now I have talked about and addressed my issues. Still feel I have a long way to go but do feel I can and will get better. What I have learned is that there are all sorts or depression and guess I just need to work through this with the help of others. I think I may have some anger issues as well. ¬†

Would appreciate any feed back from others as reading about people's situations and reading people's comments has made me understand and feel a lot better.

Because you can't be sad when you're asleep.

I've been keeping a mood journal where I rate my mood out of 10 each day for both morning and night. I realise I've cheated the system when I get up at 10 or 11am. 
On mood journals themselves I have found it to be a good indicator over time to help understand your individual patterns. It is good for personal use but would be cautious if presenting it to a professional or another person as the scales are completely subjective. I've been trying to find a comparison of 0-10 daily mood charts of a person with and a person without depression but since a mood rating is so subjective it's hard to draw comparisons. 
What I mean by subjective is that a 5 for me means - a non-mood, blank face feeling, absents of happy or sad feelings/thoughts, no intrusive thoughts, and sometimes it means I just slept through most of the morning. Whereas, and I speculate, someone without depression might place a 5 as meaning - content, flat, okay.
A better example might be that someone with depressions reasons for rating between 0-5 includes suicidal thoughts or even attempts whereas a non-depressed person it does not.

My average for this month is 6. Max 8. Min 0. - My 8's would be very good you would think, which they are... compared to my usual mood. - Brief moments of a smile, singing in he kitchen, dancing with my dog. But an 8 I have realised is still just a glimpse of my old self before depression. The 0 was that one night I got drunk and had heavy intrusive thoughts and crying almost to the point of action.

What's your experience with mood journals if you keep one, or your thoughts on it even if you don't?
What's your thoughts on sleep?

I‚Äôve always been confident, outspoken and happy.  But my personality has changed so much over
the last few years, for the worse.  I‚Äôm
so defensive, everything seems like a personal attack and all I do is argue
with friends, family and work colleagues.  

I hate every word that comes out of my mouth, and don‚Äôt know
why I am like this when I keep telling myself to change.  I hate looking in the mirror at myself, I
wish I was looking at my 18 year old self again, not the 31 year old failure
that I am. I
want to stop feeling so deeply, I‚Äôm over-emotional and over-sensitive.

I have a wonderful husband who I‚Äôve always got along with,
but he keeps disagreeing with everything I say, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs a new habit for
him. So I‚Äôm constantly trying to explain my point of view to him which turns
into an argument.  I never mean for
things to turn into arguments, and if I just keep my mouth shut things would be
fine.  He was never like this, he was the happiest person, always laughing and joking and I feel like I'm destroying him and bringing him down. I‚Äôm starting to get the feeling he
hates me, and I don‚Äôt blame him because I hate myself too.  He didn‚Äôt sign up for this, we‚Äôve been
together for 11 years and I was amazing for the first 5 years, then I started
changing. Nothing happened, I just slowly started becoming this awful thing
that I am today.

I want to stop being me because then I can stop hating
myself every day.

I've been on antidepressants for about a year, and they've hugely improved my life in many ways. One way is they saved me from pointless and stressful routines.

Before I started taking antidepressants, there were certain things I used to force myself to do every day. Some because they were good for me, some because they were sometimes fun. But it was very difficult and stressful, and often not fun. And finding the time to do it was often the hardest part, it often left me with not much free time, and I often had to sacrifice more important things. Sorry for being so vague, I'm a very closed person.

Then I started taking antidepressants, and they slowly began to relax me. I started to realise how stupid and pointless some of those things were, and slowly began toning them down. And it made my life so much more fun.

But now I think they've gone too far. They've made me bizarrely lazy. I've pretty much completely abandoned all my hobbies. I spend pretty much all day just laying in bed, doing boring and pointless things on my laptop. I've also abandoned some things that aren't fun, but are essential. For example, I don't brush my teeth much these days. It's funny how this is often a symptom of depression, yet for me it's the complete opposite.

This probably sounds like a conscious decision, and I suppose it technically is, but it really feels like it isn't. I really want to do more, but there's just something stopping me. I've tried to convince myself to just force myself, but it's a lot easier said than done. I suppose it's kinda like the way an addict tries to force themself to quit whatever they're addicted to, but simply doesn't have the capacity. So I guess you could sort of say I'm addicted to doing absolutely nothing. 

I'll never stop taking antidepressants without my doctor telling me to, because I know that would be very stupid, but it's becoming tempting. Right now, I actually think my life before I started taking them was much better than it is now. My depression was mild, and I sometimes had fun. Now I have hardly any fun, I'm incredibly bored almost every second of every day. What I'd like is a middle ground between my life now and my life before antidepressants, but that seems impossible. I used to have that, but like I said, the antidepressants pushed it too far. Does anyone have any advice?

I've been bullied at work for a while now, it was really bad last year and its mostly from two people, and I have been struggling really badly from it all while in isolation. I'm dreading going back just because of one of them in particular to the point I have a mild anxiety attack multiple times a day and feel like vomiting, but i love my job so much I don't want to lose it.
One of the guys I work with we got along really well when I started, he trained me for 3-4 months, we did not talk much after, later we got seated next to each other and he made some sexual comments which I didn't instigate, he walked up behind me and said it. He is married and now has a 1 year old daughter. He's been caring if i've cried at work or left sick, this is very rare though. Most of the time he hits things around his desk that are near me, he gets very angry at me but doesn't verbally say much, he does things he knows will upset me, he snobs me, he went to lunch with his wife and baby daughter then came back and tried to get my attention. He cuts me out of conversations and looks disgusted if i talk at work, he blanks me physically out of any conversations he can when everyone at work goes to the pub on Fridays and he makes me uncomfortable to go socialise with everyone. I tried for a long time to calm him down but it hasn't worked, like I bought him $100 worth of baby gifts. He's the favourite at work so the last thing i want to do is complain against him, especially when he talks about how happy him and his wife are with their daughter and how excited they are about her growing up. This whole thing has made me feel disgusting, i bought some new clothes for my birthday and i hated myself when i tried them on and didn't want him thinking I bought it for him or I've tried to lose weight for him. He has said before that he felt like a friend of mine was trying to learn English just to talk to him, when my friend was just trying to make friends with everyone and he couldn't and eventually left to work somewhere else. I've caught him not doing his job properly more times than i can count and he's lied to people and he's gaslighted me when i tried to ask him to stop being rude to me. I don't care for reporting him or anything I just want to feel good about myself again and gain some confidence back. It upsets me I'm jealous of him, my partner doesn't love me like his does and he gets the best stuff at work, everyone loves him and he's very talented and privileged.

Hi, I'm Jakon
So, since last December I started seeing a psychologist. I've had about 6 sessions now and I think they're going pretty well. Basically, I'm at the point where I've think I have identified what my issue/s are and I'm trying to address them, but that doesn't seem to be going very well. What my issue/s are is, probably, very common: I feel like I am inferior, worthless and incapable of attaining the future I want (largely due to childhood, choices growijg up, etc. That i'll be working on identifying with my psychologist next). I am suceeding in my uni studies (HD's, woo) but have been constantly feeling behind due to an inability to motivate, manage time effectively, care, and so on. Also, I've rexognized that a lot of my issue/s is (very) lilely to do with fear: fear of confrontation, fear of rejection, fear of faolure and so on. I'm also starting to more constructively assess when this fear arises - fear tends to wear many hats, it seems. Overall, objectively (so to speak) things are on track and I can plot out the next 3 months or so and say 'this is pretty good'.

But I feel hopeless. I feel it, just there, under the surface, sometimes closer, sometimes deeper down, like it's always going to be there waiting to bubble up until I breakdown and cry, again. Like today. I know, again, that I have a good framework for addressinf my triggers, thoughts, etc. That put me in this place and that I just have to build on them over time and, quite literally, get out more and engage more with people, and help others in particular, to feel a sense of worth and progress.

But thinking and doing that are different things. My GP, psychologist and myself have discussed me possibly going on SSRI's for depression/anxiety, but I'm unsure whether they'll be effective. Will they fix the pervasive sense of hopelessness  my high lack of self confidence and self belief, as well as the internal critic?

Hi all,
Last week i hit rock bottom. It was the lowest i have ever felt in my life. It was due to a mixture of things piling up in my life and i finally crumbled under the pile. After a complete meltdown and the helpful words of many beautiful people on beyond blue i started to see a light in the dark fog that clouded my life. This past week that light has been shining brighter as i am trying so hard to remain positive about myself and others. However tonight people who are family friends decided to throw some drama my way. I have tried to remain positive and to keep my thoughts happy but in this situation it has proven difficult to do so. These people are the type of people who thrive on drama and love playing the victim card. I just wish they would leave me out of it. They have no idea that i have depression because quiet frankly they haven't asked nor do I think they care. I just wish people could just be nice to others. I wish people could just understand that everyone is going through something in their lives and just because a person doesnt tell you what is happening in their lives doesnt mean they aren't going through a hard time. I wish I was a person who is not fazed by anyone's actions or words. It just feels like it's a constant struggle to keep myself in a happy state and it really shouldn't be this way.
Sorry for rambling on but i feel as if this is my only avenue of expressing how i feel without being judged. 
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this.

hi for a while i've had periods of time where i'm really sad for no reason and these last about 2 weeks with breaks ranging from a week to a month were i'm mostly ok. This has been happening for a long time and i don't know if im depressed or somehow just doing it for attention or over exaggerating. It is really annoying because i don't know whats wrong because if im in one of these moods and do one of the depression checklist things it says im severely high, but when im in my periods of time where i'm not as upset the test score is much lower. I've researched alot and it says its normal to be sad over time but i don't think its normal to be sad for no reason for lots of long periods of time. 
Thanks and sorry for the bad grammar

I've hit a terrible rough patch in my life where I'm just empty. This feeling of emptiness came after a really bad phase of sadness and self-loathing and I think it's time I get help. I've been continuously having these moments every since I was 7 but I never told anyone. I've been slacking on homework, and this week is exam week, I know for a fact I'm going to fail. I need help, but it's going to be incredibly difficult admitting that I have an issue. I've been thinking about the people I can go to that can get me a therapist/give me advice. My parents? Out of the question. I've kept them at arm's length my whole life and it'll be uncomfortable trying to ask them now. School friends? They do not take depression seriously. They continuously joke about it, fake it to guilt-trip people, and ask for the ""tea"" when anyone mentions having it. School faculty? Maybe. The only issue is that I see them practically everyday and I don't want them to notice my problems each time they even glance at me. I also have the problem of how I'm going to bring it up. Do I just waltz into their room and go ""Hey. I need serious help. Like, right now. Mentally""? Thank you in advance, any sort of guidance would be much appreciated.

I‚Äôve been suffering from major depression for about 7 years now and it‚Äôs not letting up. At this point I‚Äôm considering getting a support dog. The only issue is I have no idea how to do it and if depression is a good enough excuse. It‚Äôs hard for me to go to school without breaking down and if the depression isn‚Äôt enough I‚Äôm also in the middle of autism burnout and it‚Äôs not great. Dogs pretty much instantly calm me down and I love being around them as much as humanly possible so I can calm down.

Hello everyone.

I don't know how to explain it but I will do the best I can. So this all started about 3 years ago and everything was going fine until the day when I got cheated on and in the space of 3 days was with someone new and crushed me for 6 months till i finally started standing on my feet again . However since this time I noticed that I am every now and then fighting my own head (sometimes on a daily basis) but I have also been struggling to sleep, have fun and struggling to hold onto friendships. This I have been battling with for 2 years and never been able to get help because I can't have any records on file about this but running out of options.....

Sorry if this doesn't make sense but I have no idea what to say or do.

I am not sure if my depression is coming back but I feel anxious all the time and am constantly overthinking. I don't know what to do.

I [29] have been with my boyfriend [32] for 3.5 years. During this time we have lived with his parents. I have expressed to my boyfriend on and off for over a year that I want us to move out together. He said that we would once I am finished uni and working. I have been out of uni since October and working since then. I tend to avoid bringing up serious topics e.g. moving out, getting married, kids, travel etc because he becomes offensive and mean. He will either talk to me rudely or ignore me completely so we don't end up talking about it. To this day I am not even sure what he wants because he is so vague or brushes it off. I bought up wanting to move out again a little over 2 weeks ago. I sent it as a message because I was scared to raise it in person. He ignored my message so I raised the issue again when he was home. He spoke with his usual ""you're an idiot"" tone of voice I call it, giving me his usual excuses like renting is dead money, interest rates are too high, I could lose my job etc. I said that if he doesn't want to move out I'd like to move out on my own. He said he didn't want that and told me to keep staying with him so we can keep saving. But I don't know how long we will be saving for!!

The whole time I have been living here has been tough but ever since I started in my dream job I feel more accomplished and should be living in my own place like an adult does. It has gotten to the point where I dread coming home. I am irritated and moody whenever I am here. I feel as if I am starting to resent my boyfriend. Everything he does now annoys me and I don't feel like having sex. All I can think about is my own space. We have never had our privacy, his mum is loud, nosy, sometimes she makes snide comments to me but insists she is joking. If I am in my room too long, she makes comments. If I sleep too long she makes comments. I work shift work so I need sleep at different times.

I just don't know what to do. I really want my own place to live but I'm worried my boyfriend will break up with me and about all the things his mum will say. I also keep thinking about running away and living and working overseas. He has made it clear he doesn't want to. I've tried talking to my sisters about it but basically since they both have kids, my issues aren't as big as theirs. 

Just wanting someone to listen.

Hi 
I am new to this forum, ( I am a mother of two and currently pregnant with my third), I have a loving and supportive family. 
As they say better to be late than sorry. I have decided that I need help with my anxiety, self worth issues, never been formally diagnosed, ( I have booked an appointment with our GP and shall be following his advise ) 
But meanwhile I am trying to connect with people who can help me walk through this phase of my life. 
unemployment is my major concern (only been unemployed for past 3 years due to family circumstances ) but it has impacted me more than I thought it would, hubby has been kind enough to give me some spare money every month but I miss my financial freedom, it has put my self worth at stake, I sometimes feel tired of being worthless ( don‚Äôt get me wrong I love my family, but on personal level I feel unaccomplished ) I do have friends but I have problem opening up to them as I fear being judged. 
I have had emotional breakdown a few times which does upset my family, making me all the more guilty of my actions, but the fact is I have never shared my concerns with anyone, not even to my husband. 
I hope a good counsellor can help me address my issues and I just want to have a normal and happy life with no inhibitions about myself.

I am not sure where to post, but here goes:

3 years ago i got an infection in my leg which needed imidiate surgery to fix. 5 months later finally able to walk and go vack to work
Other infections (due to diabetties) resulted in me loosing one toe , then another, then 3 more, then more of my foot , until the doctors felt it would be best to remove the foot below the knee 
Up until that decision i had deep depression, but once i made the decision i became happy , i could now move on with my life
Leg came off xmas 2019 , some complications but healling has been slower than expected 
I cannot work, and i am self employed, 3 years of working for a few months then taking time off for surgeries has taken a toll on finances
They have tried to fit a prosthetic but the fitting is not going well
I cannot walk
I cannot drive
I have no money left
I don't know if i will ever walk or if i will be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of my life
I have not slept properly in 6 months
I have spoken to doctors, and psycologists and their only advice is to be patient

Hi all,
I have posted here before. However today I am writing because I am tired. I read posts from this forum from time to time, depression is tiring. I am asking for advice due to recent events.
I have a good relationship with my partner, who I have a son with. He is attentive, caring, and looks after me. Around six months ago I met someone who I feel very attracted to. I am older than this guy. We have become friends, he knows my true age, and has told me that I am too old for him. I understand this. He has given me his phone number, but I am only allowed to text him. I am very attracted to him.
However, I am struggling with all sorts of things. Number one: I am betraying my partner. I have told him about this guy and he has told me I can text anyone who I want. I wish he would say no. I wish he would not say that. Number two: this guy tolerates all of my crap, and has given me his phone number. However, I am only allowed to text him. Number Three: I am very confused about this all.
I was diagnosed with BiPolar two weeks ago. I am very confused. I would appreciate any advice on this matter. I am a mum in a unhappy relationship, but I really need to do the right thing. In particular, I need to do the right thing by my son.
Thanks

Hi all, Wondering if you could shed some light on your experience with adhd.
I‚Äôm 21, for most of my adolescence and adult years I‚Äôve felt like my brain is unorganised and messy. I‚Äôm having trouble even paying enough attention writing this that I had to put on music and take a few social media breaks. 
I watched a video on ADHD in adults and I was surprised that I could tick off a lot of the symptoms as the way I feel. I‚Äôve researched so many mental disorders and never fully believed I had any of them, except anxiety and depression which I haven‚Äôt been diagnosed with, I convince myself I don‚Äôt need to see a doctor and just suffer more every year. 
I‚Äôll list some of the things I experience I don‚Äôt want to write too in detail as that‚Äôs boring to read but here are what I attribute to maybe being ADHD (just took another break from writing this i can‚Äôt pay enough attention) 
*my room is always messy even though I hate mess and want everything to be organised and tidy. Making my bed feels like too much work and when I eventually clean my room maybe once a month it takes me ages because I get too distracted and don‚Äôt know where to start, it‚Äôs overwhelming. 
*I have no life direction and have a new idea each month but can‚Äôt commit to anything
*i get bored with anything and everything in my life easily and then I don‚Äôt apply myself because I can‚Äôt bring myself to do something that isn‚Äôt stimulating. Started a course online and it was boring so I haven‚Äôt touched it in months. I only just got a fulltime job and I hate it. I feel like I need to be doing more but I never do 
*along with being messy I‚Äôm unorganised and put everything off until it call comes crashing down at one time. I blame it on being a procrastinator but I feel like it‚Äôs not normal. From exercise to appointments I just put them off or don‚Äôt do them at all. 
*i feel the need to constantly be working and keeping busy and on days off I feel anxiety because I know I‚Äôm putting things off. I can‚Äôt relax. (as I‚Äôm reading this back I skim over the words because I‚Äôm too impatient to read it properly which I do with all bodies of text
ive thought it has always been depression as I had a rough childhood but I‚Äôm thinking maybe anxiety and depression are co-existing with ADHD? Have any of you experienced similar feelings. I feel so lost

Hi everyone. My mental health challenges mainly started in 1-2 years ago and the worst of it lasted for at least half a year (Iam keeping the numbers vague to protect my own privacy). I had recently quit tafe, moved into a new house with my family at the time and this is when my issues started arising. I couldn't sleep in this new house, it was near the train line, however I believe there was other factors that caused the sleep problems. 1 week later i drove out to a bay and had a panic attack in my car, this was my first and only panic attack of my life. I was vegan at the time as I believed this was a healthy way to eat but I believe it may not be the way to go long-term.  I was slowly losing my mind, I would constantly think about the train noise and how I cannot sleep, my brain fog, at times the brain fog would turn into feeling like my brain is being fried and imploding. I even acquired employment during this time but I was a complete and utter mess, I would break dishes etc, use the POS machine with inaccuracy and couldn't remember any new knowledge in this job. god damn it i was so messed up. I would look in the mirror and have thoughts that I look so tired. Things that helped me improved my mental health would be eating a balanced diet. I would caution vegan diets, feel free to continue however if you experience negative health effects while on a vegan diet please reconsider it, how is it ethical to not eat animals when you are damaging yourself in the process. Now I am not sure if I have self-esteem issues, this experience feels like it has damaged me psychologically in some way. I feel like I am less productive and less functional than other people who are able to maintain well paying jobs while the only job I have able to keep is a hospitality job. I am somewhat optimistic but pessimistic about my future at the same time. My girlfriend has moved in with me, I genuinely worry sometimes about the future, How will I able to work consistently and provide for her and potentially kids and even if she leaves me, how do I provide for myself if I constantly have a mindset that is avoidant to working and employment? I am trying to get back into working again after 3 months out. Iam grateful for what I have but sometimes I feel like I learn slower than most people, so Iam at a disadvantage. Some information may be missing so feel free to ask anything. I still respect the vegan point of view, I was one myself so don't take that too seriously.

Hello
I am wanting to know if there are people who have had mental health incident/breakddown that were largely caused by work but never did anything about it with the employer (ie claimed workcover).
If so, what were your reasons and do you regret your decision?
I'm 4 years post my incident where I was involuntarily admitted to the MHU which was mostly caused by my workplace however the seriousness of the condition/incident was sumwhat contributed to by pre-existing trauma from a previous workplace and having been succeptible to depression and anxiety in the past. I'm still at the workplace but we were taken over by another company and I have never moved on to a new job for a few reasons including still recovering from my incident, lack of confidence at the idea of transitioning to a new job and also I had a baby recently and have only recently returned to work part-time from maternity leave.
Only recently I have been diagnosed with bi-polar and have ongoing psychiatric monitoring. Though I am currently stable I have only started to feel more like myself again in the last 6 months and I have returned to my uni studies to finally finish the last part of my degree. From a work perspective I still have lost alot of self-confidence even though my skills and experience are worth alot more then what I've accepted for myself in recent years. I sometimes feel angry at my current workplace for how they handled things and also the bullying and trauma I experienced at my previous workplace and how it got swept under the carpet. 
I don't know how to really move on except hopefully at some point I will have the confidence to find another job in a good company and get back into my desired career that I spent many years working towards, even if it was that job that gave me the most trauma.

Hi,

I'm reaching out for help and some direction.

As my title states I am a mess atm. I have never felt so low. Every waking moment I am in my own dark negative thoughts. And the negativity is all consuming. Furthermore, I am in tears multiple times a day. For  example, it's almost lunch time and I've counted 8 desperate times where I am overwhelmed. 

I did the depression test on this sight and I got 40 which it tells me is high.

I don't know what to do....

I don‚Äôt have any support and I feel like I‚Äôm losing control and I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. I can‚Äôt understand how someone can know and be told how down and depressed someone is but just keep making them feel worse and worse.

Hi everyone. I joined in 2018 but I can't remember so I'm starting fresh. I'm anxious about reaching out so please bear with me.
Hi, I'm 21 years old. I have decided to post as I feel I don't know what else to do at this point. I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder in 2017 as well as abandonment issues ( but I don't believe that was a real diagnose)
Last year my mum and I moved from our house of 13 years, she moved in with her partner of 5 years and I was moved into a small cottage next door (on the same block) The move has been hard on me.
At the moment I feel like I have depression. I'm low all the time, I don't have much energy, I have lost interest in the things I used to like doing, I often can't get out of bed, I find it hard to do day to day tasks, I have had this feeling once before after I left school.
Before my bother left home about 3-4 years ago he had serious depression and it was hard my mum and I (and obviously my brother)
I don't feel comfortable telling my mum, ever since the move I have felt like its been difficult to tell her how I feel. Whenever I do see her, I mask my emotions and it's getting exhausting to hide.
My mum and I also believe I am somewhere on the spectrum and have been since birth or a very young age This also has been hard to process.
I have been on medication before and seen a few therapists. going to therapy worked when I was a kid and again when I was 17 but not anymore and I have no interest in doing it again. I would possibly consider group therapy even those I have social anxiety. I just hate the thought of meeting someone new and always having to go over my so far life story plus I don't get talking about your feelings to a stranger (I also hate talking about my self). I'm sure its worked for many people and I'm happy it's helped them. I'm also not to keen on going back on medication. I had bad side effects last time.
I don't have anyone I can talk to since I have no friends. I left school at a young age. The last time I think I had a conversation with someone my age was at least 2 years ago.
I just want to know that I'm not the only one who feels this way. I think I just need a connection.
I'm sorry, I hope I've made sense. I've re-written this so many times. Thank you for taking the time to read this.¬†

Have you ever felt like your brain is just finding reasons to cry everyday? 
I remember the last time I had felt like this. It was in year 12, finishing school, where I was striving hard to get the right marks to get into an overseas university. And the stress was coming from the fact that I had really messed up in the past two years academically, and my confidence was shattered. I was surviving ONLY by the confidence and support of my family. And I can't tell you how much they took in to help me touch my dreams. 
Fast forward to uni. I got to where I wanted to be. I got to the degree I wanted. I was studying. Making new friends. New Culture. Staying with my sister after 7 years. It was tough, no way am I gonna deny that. But I was happy, on a daily basis. I have vivid memories of walking out of the house every morning towards uni with a cool smile and fresh deep breaths, even if I had a hundred things to do that day. Even with the worst stress of my exams, I was still happy afterwards. I remember actually realising and telling myself that my life feels better than before. 
Now it doesn't feel that way anymore. First of all, I think my loss of routine due to COVID has affected me more than I thought it would. But I think its more than that. I have this really shit gut feeling that I am not happy, on a general basis. And I can't exactly pinpoint why. Most of the times its about how I am not as accomplished in life as I thought I should be by now, and seeing all my peers race ahead... I know the grass looks greener on the other side, but I can't help looking at them. Another huge factor is my weight. I just can't seem to get rid of it and believe me I have tried a HUNDRED TIMES. 
I have been crying almost everyday for weeks now. it's just SOMETHING or the other. One day its an argument with my sister. Next day I am feeling lonely. Next day I feel guilty for procrastinating. Next day I feel shit for eating mindlessly. It's always something or the other. 
It is definitely affecting my motivation. I am still proactive enough to say, ""Nope. Don't give up, you got this, you are strong you are amazing and you just have to focus on your goals"", but I am pretty sure a lot of the times I am procrastinating because I don't want to face my problems. 
And I have been told several times that I am an overthinker and overanalyser. 
Does this seem like an overthinker's muse? Maybe because I am at home all day and somehow this monotonous living is getting to my head?

Hi all, 
I have suffered from depression and anxiety for the last three years. I moved here from Spain to be with my partner and it has been extremely difficult for me to be so far away from my family which has probably triggered the depression. I have also struggled to find my place here but I was lucky enough to have a job and find some friends which have helped but with the COVID 19 situation I lost my job and I have barely had any social interaction. 
My intention was to go back home in Christmas time before all of this happened and it has been very hard for me to be away from my family during this challenging time especially knowing what they have gone through. All I want is to be able to see my family this year and all I keep hearing in the news, articles, social media etc it's that they won't let people out of Australia until next year. I am Permanent Resident here but still, I am a citizen of another country and the thought of not being able to leave for so long is continuously in my head and making my anxiety and depression get worse every day. I try not to think about it but it has become very difficult to focus on anything else especially being unemployed and alone all day.

So I‚Äôve moved quite far from home for work. This job should be my dream job and I should be happy. I put in so much effort at uni, and the recruitment process for this industry is extremely competitive. I‚Äôm a few weeks in and I hate it. I feel like I wasted 4 years of my life doing a degree, which now makes me feel so depressed and lost. I‚Äôve also gained weight because I don‚Äôt feel like cooking (something I used to love), I haven‚Äôt been exercising because I don‚Äôt want to go outside here (I used to run outdoors 5 days a week). On my days off I just sit at home eating or sleeping. I don‚Äôt even watch Netflix or anything. I tried antidepressants however they all made me extremely nauseous, which made me feel worse. I feel like my life circumstances are contributing to my head space at the moment so I‚Äôm not sure if seeking medical help is even the right move. A dr can‚Äôt fix my job or where I live. 
sorry this post is a bit of a mess but I just feel so lost and alone.

Hello, I am a newbie here but have been suffering for a long time. I am 31 and have no friends. Sure there are people around me like on Facebook but they are not really  friends. I have been alone since 20 years old and I feel like it's taking its toll on me. I can't live like this anymore. My family tries to understand but I don't think they do completely. I literally have no one to talk to nor hang out with. I live alone with my dog and do not have a current job. I cry every night wondering where I went wrong üòî
I feel a doctor wouldn't be able to help because they won't be able to give me friends. I feel like I don't want to go outside anymore cause I don't want to see other people making memories with friends. No guy will want me because I have no friends. 
I'm in agony everyday. I just don't want to live like this anymore. üò• I am so lonely üò•

Hello, this is my first time dealing with depression and looking for help while I wait for a psychologist. 
I quit my job to move from Melbourne to Perth in February  with my boyfriend where he grew up and wanted to return. I started uni in early March, and then the country went into lock down a few weeks later. I was doing ok for the first couple of weeks, staying on track with uni and doing things around the house, but in the last 4 weeks my mental state really fell apart. I was fighting with my boyfriend, missing assignments, not wanting to get out of bed, and when I did I just moved to the couch. I started having suicidal thoughts because I felt so alone and I knew how far behind with uni I was, I couldn't see myself catching up. Everyday I feel like crying. I've just come back to Melbourne and need to get back to Perth for a practical assessment for uni. My boyfriend is saying that I'm not ready to come back because I haven't seen a psychologist. But I feel that by the weekend, I will be ready to come back and I need to get back, and if I miss this assessment then I won't have any reason to continue with uni, nor will I feel re-energised to get back on track. I don't know what to do. He's telling me to change the date for the assessment but all the sessions are booked out. I don't really know if anyone has some advice or anything, but I guess this is just a first step for me while I wait. 

Thank you for taking the time to read, I look forward to reading your comments.

Stay safe xo

So I force myself to go. 
All I'm saying is when is it okay to give in, stop trying, because feels li k e I'm just stuck here. Rotting away here anyways.

Hi I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm posting here I guess I‚Äôm searching for help because I‚Äôm not really sure what to do anymore.. I‚Äôm 24 and I‚Äôve worked on projects for the last few years so move to different remote areas all the time.. This in itself creates a lot of loneliness as I‚Äôve found it‚Äôs inevitable that you lose touch with your friends and family back home.. people move on with their lives while your away.. I always had my long term partner working away with me though so I was happy.. we then broke up and I got into a relationship straight away because I made a mistake and felt I couldn‚Äôt be alone.. I was then alienated from everyone I knew.. I moved away and never spoke to my friends or family and isolated myself completely with this person.. He gave me a job and looked after me and i didn‚Äôt know how to look after myself so I stayed because I was scared of being alone.. anyway I finally came up with the courage to break it off because I knew it wasn‚Äôt right and now I am completely alone.. I feel stupid because atleast I had someone to talk to even if it wasn‚Äôt a good relationship.. I‚Äôm now back living with my parent and it is a hostile dangerous place for me that I don‚Äôt feel safe in.. but I can‚Äôt leave as I‚Äôm not working anymore. i can‚Äôt find somewhere to live that is affordable for just me.. I have slowly isolated myself from everyone by one way or another and now I don‚Äôt have anyone in my life that I can talk to about this.. I have no one to help me and I‚Äôm not sure how to help myself.. I‚Äôve made so many mistakes and lost so many people.. I can‚Äôt think one 1 person that would notice I was gone if I disappeared tomorrow.. I feel trapped and don‚Äôt see a way out of this

I'm not sure what I'm hoping for by posting here, perhaps simply expressing it somewhere will help or maybe help someone else. I'm 29, male, and have never been in a long-term relationship or at least any meaningful relationship. I feel like I've failed at life and there is no going back. I really can't see how or when I'm going to find someone that loves me. I constantly feel down, unmotivated and sad. I don't see anyway out. 

In my late teens and most of my twenties I simply took the rejections and failures at dating to be just part of the process. But having recently moved back from the UK after 3.5 years there (I quit my job in my mid 20s to do a PhD), I see all my friends here moving on in there careers, in long-term relationships, getting married, or having kids. I feel left behind with no hope of finding happiness with anyone. All my female friends in the UK where either already in relationships or weren't interested in me. I really thought I would meet someone in the UK who shared my interests and things but it just didn't work out.

I don't see how things are going to change. The sort of employment that my PhD leads to is one where I will end up spending short amounts of time (1-2) years hopping between different unis. This is not going to help with settling down into a stable relationship. When I start thinking about the future and my 30s I feel my chest tightening and almost have a sort of panicked anxious feeling.

When I tell people how all this makes me feel they say I should be happy that I'm privileged to have been able to study what I love and do it at a high level. But I would give it all up just for a girlfriend or some prospect of a loving relationship.

I still feel the same overwhelming full body mental pain. It is so familiar now. I'm just more comfortable and accepting of it I guess. I feel it now till it passes or I just seem to get on the next day or push it into the background. It is still there though. I let myself feel it  when I have the luxury or maybe I have the control now to decide to let it have it's moment. I use anti anxiety meds to push it away when I need to. It's okay until a life event happens and then I have less control. I listened to the podcast ""No feeling is final"" today which reminded me of everything I've been through. I needed an online chat but they close at midnight so I'm here. I think I have to accept this is my life. I guess I've become pretty good at dealing with that. That full body pain still gets me. Does anyone know what I mean? I remember this feeling as young as primary school but  was diagnosed at age 19. Im 44 now. Wow that's a long time. It is amazing that I am still here and working and seeming normal (hopefuly) in my daily life mostly. I haven't thought about my years in mental hospital for some time but felt like talking about it again if anyone out there is listening.  I feel like confessimg thay I m not ""cured"" I am still mentaly unwell. Just a practised expert at hiding.

Hi
Im a 27year old Female living with my fiance in our 1 year old brand new house, we are due to get married in August pending Corona Virus Restrictions...
But I am constantly finding myself overthinking and pin pointing small details of the house that i dislike and then it begins to spiral into me hating everything and nothing is perfect.
I do feel like im a perfectionist, as when i was younger at school, if something wasn't done right i would start again multiple times until it was perfect, and i feel these tendencies are coming back more aggressively.
I know that i love my house as we designed everything how we wanted it, and its beautiful, but then my mind begins to wonder and i cant help but feel like its not good enough. Im struggling with turning off these thoughts and being at peace as its still a work in progress: landscaping not done etc.. But i really cant.
I dont want to live like this and i dont know how to turn my head off

Around 18 months ago I started a new part time job. It has been a really stressful environment and I found myself constantly stressing about work, waking up in the night and being unable to sleep because I was so worried. 
This lead to me constantly feeling down, even when I was on a holiday or taking time off work I was in a really bad mental state. Things started to get worse and I would with feel withdrawn, nauseous, tired for nor reason, unmotivated and just unhappy. After feeling this way on and off for almost nine months I have begun to wonder if I suffer from a form of depression 
My biggest problem is I don't know how to go about this. What sort of medical profession do I talk to in order to find out if I do have depression? What can I do to help me cope? Is there something else that could be making me feel this way? and should i talk to someone about this? I want to tell someone but I don't want people to see me feeling this sort of way as a burden, or for people to worry about me. 
Thank you :)

How do you forgive yourself when the voice in your head constantly brings up the things you‚Äôve done. If I can‚Äôt beat this it will consume me and that will be it. The only advice my psych has given me is that I‚Äôm not a bad person, I just made a mistake, a bad one at that but I need to forgive myself and move on. It sounds so easy , everything I‚Äôve done just replays. I hate what I did, it‚Äôs not me. Others have forgiven me but I just can‚Äôt let go. I don‚Äôt know how to let go. I want to be free of this darkness that is shadowing me.

Diagnosed with BPD about 3 years ago after a long battle with ""not feeling like myself"" and I am really struggling to stay connected with therapies and medications. Most of the time I feel like I have lived like this for so long that this is the only normal for me. I mean what's a few mood swings and a touch of emotional instability, right? 
I ditched a few shitty relationships (surprise surprise) and was happily living my single life - with only a few self sabotaging behaviours and an addiction problem. Addiction to anything I can be addicted to really. And alas, along comes a person who makes the world stop and confesses their growing feelings for me. 
At first I was so unsure if I could feel the same. It took months of thinking and no pressure to give in to the idea that romantic feelings could develop. Well I thought I was being mature and was using my brilliant insight to make every tiny decision, until BAM! I let love in. Now I haven't confessed my undying love and I am not chasing them away with my obsessive need to hear them say good morning as soon as I see they are online, but instead I am internalising all of these thoughts and being dumped with them in my lonely hours, trying to sift through what is logical and what is all in my head! 
This person has been a close friend for 20 years. There are no surprises when it comes to my mental health. I just can't keep reading internet articles about BPD and relationships. I need to talk to a real person. Someone please connect. xx

I have suffered severe anxiety and depression for a very long time (first panic attack eight years old). I've seen plenty of psychologists ect but nothing seems to help. Sometimes I am normal and even feel up but then I seem to come crashing down again for no reason. I've quit studies and work at times just because my mental health was getting too full on. I also seem to have PMDD and go into fits of rage unexpectedly and I can't control it. Lately I've been thinking it may be bipolar 2? my Mother and Grandfather had bipolar but I don't get extreme mania where I dont sleep. Sometimes I just feel up and excited for no reason and super chatty and everything seems easy and then I don't want to face anyone at all other times. Question is how up do you get if you get with bipolar two?

Hi there,
 I am a middle-aged woman. As I have previously written, last week I was diagnosed with Bi-Polar Disorder. I  trying to get my head around it and will do what my psychiatrist tells me to do to stay well. One thing really is affecting me is the fact that I was not diagnosed earlier. Would it have made a difference in my life? I have lost so much through my behaviour, and even I could not understand why I was behaving the way I was. I have suffered a very serious depression early last decade that almost took my life. I have lost friends and jobs. I now to get better, but I cannot help but feel like I've lost something important in my life. I am sure that others are going through this as well. How do you accept this?
Thank you

Hi guys, it would be nice if you could give your 2 cents on this. Thanks in advance.
I have been struggling on how to show my emotions in a concise yet orderly manner. Currently I am completing my HSC. As a normal year 12 student, I know that it is natural for you to feel stressed about your final year in school. My mom has been the sole cause of my depression and dark thoughts. She screams and swears at me for being an idiot. I am trying to improve my grades in which I have successfully have in Economics and German to an 88% and 85% respectively compared to my 65% average in year 11. However, she only focuses on the subjects that are still bad (Math Ext 1 and English Adv). She tells me she wants to see results but that isn't possible since I only took 1 assessment due to our pre-trials being canceled by the coronavirus. I thought that she would see an increase in my Economics and German and encourage me but that never happened. She constantly tells me that I am not going to be able to go to university. Other day when I told her I want to go overseas for university and that I would take out the student loan and sort it out, she just laughed at my face. Then she kept on putting me down with her comments and when I told her I was still going to apply she got physical¬†and screamed at me. Other day she told me she'd be dipping and leaving me to fend for myself for the rest of the year and my life. She also blames me for her horrible marriage relationship (btw don't know if this is tmi but my dad cheated on her in the past and found out). Even though she's dipping, I have to move out on the day of the final HSC exam because by then the rent would be done. I wanted to bring this up with my other family members however, there was a rant couple days ago about mental health in which they believe that mental health only effects the weak or the mentally ill or psychopaths. This made me think that I was abnormal. Thus, I felt uncomfortable to share my thoughts to them. I have had dark thoughts comeback to me from the past. I am scared about how I would support myself after my HSC financially. I feel insecure about my future.
Btw if you have any knowledge on student loan or youth allowance leave your suggestions.
Thanks a lot again.

My mother‚Äôs health has been a concern for a little while. Earlier
this year she fell in the backyard and was not found for 4 hours. The ambulance
was called but she refused to go to hospital for an overnight check-up. I found
out last week that she has bursitis; I think she got this from her fall. (Mum
wears a vital call alarm around her neck and she can press the button if she is
in trouble and the ambulance will turn up)
My sister and I went to my Mums doctor last Wednesday; my family
had a number of questions to ask the doctor as Mum does not fully answer
questions about her health status when asked. One of the questions was should
Mum be driving. I live with Mum and she sometimes borrows my car, in the five years,
that I have had the car there has been a 4 or 5 accidents, Mum was driving each
time. I am concerned that Mum‚Äôs reflexes are not as good as they once were.
The doctor
said to Mum that she should not have been driving six months ago. Mum has a
full licence though she can only drive up to 10 km distance from home.
Last Saturday I could tell that Mum was unhappy, she told me
that she had a sleepless night and that she felt like jumping off the gap since
she was not allowed to drive anymore and that she felt like she was being rail
roaded. This took me aback.

After a minute to compose my thoughts I said to Mum that she was being unfair
and how would she like it if I was to tell her that I wanted to jump off the
gap (cliff). I think Mum is using emotional blackmail, and it is unfair on my
immediate family and me.  Mum is on a
department of veteran affair pension so the doctors, specialist can organise a
taxi to take her to, and from doctor‚Äôs appointments and I can do all her
shopping needs for her.
It worries me where Mums headspace is, my sister and Mum
goes to the doctor this coming Wednesday. I do not know whether I want advice
on this or not, I had to share this.

Two years ago I was doing very well for myself. I'd pulled myself out of nearly lifelong depression. I managed to do this by a combination of factors:
 
- Getting on the right medication.
- Successfully quitting alcohol, drugs, and tobacco.
- Pulling out of bad relationships and cultivating new ones.
- Getting plenty of physical exercise.
 
I became so enthusiastic about exercise that I managed to become a hiking group leader. I was in excellent physical and mental condition at the time. I managed to find a wonderful girlfriend who I still live with. I managed to retain full-time employment and get a raise for the first time in my life.
 
However, a number of things happened and now everything is falling apart. A year and a half ago I tore a ligament in my shoulder, which has prevented me from doing any strength training since then. Last year I began to think that maybe I had successfully beaten depression and didn't need medication anymore. I stopped taking it and was off of it for six months. I stopped going on hikes or otherwise socializing much at all. I stopped visiting my family, and any attempts at visiting them since then have been extremely distressing for me. Towards the end of that six months I was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome. This was another problem that was difficult for me to cope with.
 
I was due to have a colonoscopy and endoscopy in March to help treat my irritable bowel syndrome, but the pandemic caused all those appointments to be canceled. This was a huge setback. I thought I should start taking my antidepressant again. However, about ten days in, I had a massive panic attack and ended up in the emergency room. We switched to a new antidepressant that I have been on for about six or seven weeks now. Adjusting to it was extremely difficult and I missed collectively about two weeks of work. My employer has been very patient with me.
 
Lately, the next blow came when I injured my knee running a few weeks ago. My body is all banged up now and I can't exercise anymore. I have daily knee pains. I have to be careful with my shoulder when doing my manual labour job.
 
Everything feels broken. I have a broken shoulder, broken knee, broken tummy, broken brain. Yesterday I broke down and cried. I told my girlfriend I don't know if I can work right now. I got zero sleep last night. I didn't go in to work today and I think my employer is losing patience. Exercise was a major key to my previous recovery. Now, I don't know how to recover.

So, this is something extremely new for me and makes me super uncomfortable (but I hope I actually post it). 
I have suffered with severe mental health issues since I was about 13 or so and I‚Äôm now 22. I thought this would just be a ‚Äúphase‚Äù and that O would ‚Äúget over it‚Äù like so many told me, but that could not be further from the truth. I have not been able to work a full time job in a few years and I am currently only doing casual work. I‚Äôm grateful that I have a job especially during a time like this but I‚Äôm struggling to find the motivation to do anything, especially go into work. My family think this is a joke but have no idea what it‚Äôs like to wake up everyday and hate the person you are. Hate everything about yourself to the point where you just don‚Äôt care anymore. If I get out of bed I usually don‚Äôt want to talk to anyone because I already know that no matter what I try to say it will be disregarded and I will be told to ‚Äúwake up to myself‚Äù or ‚Äúget over it‚Äù. I feel like I‚Äôm going to lose my job because this week I just have not been able to physically move. It‚Äôs been like this all weekend and now it‚Äôs Wednesday I really don‚Äôt want to do anything except sleep all day. I don‚Äôt know  what to do! If I try to talk to someone within my family (which is so difficult to do), they just think it‚Äôs because of covid etc or it‚Äôs just a phase, but I have been like this for most of my life and it really annoys me. I hate it so much. I thought my self harming would stop when I became an adult but sometimes I really can‚Äôt help it and that‚Äôs the only way I find a moment of relief. Nothing I do brings me happiness. I truly hate this. I can help others when they are in crisis, but I can‚Äôt do it for myself! I really hate this. 
I apologise for being all over the place with that but I just have so much on my mind that I don‚Äôt know how to articulate things properly at the moment.

It has lead a very private person to spilling her guts online as she has no one left in her life. This is so embarrassing it must be my therapy! I have long term treatment resistant depression and was previously a superwoman caring for 4 others now reduced to someone who can only get out of bed to pay the bills. At 57 I know I will now remain single as I'm a recluse due to lack of confidence. I don't know what else to say really I wish I could turn my mind off and not feel the painful memories of the past as that's your only company. I wish everyone all the very best, I feel every waking minute of your pain, with love xx

Hi Everyone, I have been suffering with this since 2012. My boss subjected me to 6 years of systematic bullying ( Abusing me in front of the other employees and general harassment and a lot lot more). This lasted until 2018. In 2016 i was harassed by the police in a case of mistaken identity which lasted for 3 years. I left my job in 2018 and am in a happier work environment and the Police thing ended this year. I just cannot get my life back on track, I am on Anti-Depressants and they dont seem to work. I get panic attacks and i cant even spend time with my friends as i feel like i am worthless. 2012-2018 destroyed my life and i even had many thoughts on ending my life and more so on how to do it. My wife and kids are the only thing that keep me going. fed up with feeling like this. just dont know what to do

Hi everyone,
I'm only just working up the courage to say what I'm dealing with. Having read lots of posts over the last few days from people in much worse situations I can't help but feel like a whinging brat, but at the same time I am very tired of keeping everything to myself and things don't seem to be getting better. 
I'm a 20yo old uni student, living away from home, completing an arts degree in music performance. I come from a stable and supportive family, no traumatic events, decent friendships from an early age that I still maintain. Hell, I don't even have to work during my degree thanks to scholarships and money from my parents. Objectively quite an enviable life. So what's the issue? Pretty much everything + depression. Oh, I also have T1DM which sucks.
 I'm very homesick and miss my family - but if I stay at home nothing improves, I stagnate. 
I have lots of acquaintances, very few friends, and at the moment I'd say no close friends. I feel that the more people know me, the less they come to like me. So I'll just keep it brief and say I struggle with forming intimate connections with people, and I blame no one but myself for that.
I generally have a pessimistic world view. Not so much that we're all doomed, but rather that we are powerless to dismantle the structures that perpetuate injustices, and that in order to do so would cause even more harm in the short term. Moreover, I see so many smart and politically engaged people with absolutely no interest in understanding the other side of the debate. Everyone is polarised.  
I see no meaning in life on an existential level. I am not religious and my life philosophy is probably one of hedonism at the moment. Yet at the same time my depression and social ineptitude mean that I cannot even explore that. 
As for uni, whilst I find playing and listening to music enormously helpful, the highly competitive environment and heavy practical workload is not healthy for me. I feel mediocre at best in comparison to my peers, and despite lots of focused effort to better myself the progress feels negligible.
Of late, I have come to drink a LOT of alcohol. Binge drinking several times a week, normally on my own. I don't fully understand why, but I feel it 'dumbs me down' to a point where I can actually relate with other people (and oh yes I know how pretentious that sounds and hate myself for it!). Alcohol, music, and my cat at home, are the only things that I feel bring me genuine pleasure.

Hi everyone, I feel so overwhelmed.
Well that word would really describe how I have been feeling most of my life. I am 43, Mum of three boys. Married. I have been suffering from anxiety and depression for over 20 years. I feel so alone with it. I have stopped seeing a psychologist years ago.
With my husband working almost all the time, huge financial worries, home learning, marriage problems, kids fighting, I have all my family in Europe - so no family support here, having a hard time finding work, my husband basically blames my anxiety for our marriage problems and I ought to get it fixed - that is the support I am getting from him.
I have been wanting to get help for a while. I just don't know where to turn to under the current circumstances & I cannot afford expensive treatment. I am so confused, I don't know where to start and I am so tired of feeling overwhelmed. You would think at 43 one would have their shit together. I have been on medication for years now. Well it is obviously not really working. Feeling so useless. My poor boys!
If you have any suggestions of where to start - I would be very appreciative.
Thanks!

About to undergo my second series of electro convulsive therapy after 10 rounds at the start of the year. Also looking to changing my anti psychotic and depression medication to ones with less side effects, tried to work out but was followed by 2 pysch nurses a social worker and a security guard. The psychiatrist has sectioned me for 3 weeks while I undergo treatment. The biggest hassle was telling my boss not to send me any more shifts till I'm out. I was off my medication and feeling awful and on the verge of something bad ,so I'm glad I'm in a position to improve and change for the better ,the shopping centre attack in wa is a prime example of having to continue with medication and keep mental health issues. I am in the hcu ,high care unit, wish me luck.

Hi all,
I can feel a depressive episode has been bubbling along in the background of my mind for a while, but things have been more or less, okay so it hasn‚Äôt fully shown itself yet. An incident at work yesterday has triggered something and I can‚Äôt seem to shake it. 
But to the topic of the forum - I‚Äôm finding it really really difficult to get myself into a good space when there has been increased research and knowledge on the effects of loneliness on mental health. Relationships are the most crucial thing to a healthy life, so we are told. I‚Äôm someone who is quite socially awkward, don‚Äôt trust people due to a past trauma and don‚Äôt make friends easily (for a number of reasons). 
Knowing these two things, I feel like I‚Äôm doomed - how am I supposed to be healthy and well when I can‚Äôt do what is most important for my health?  Does anyone else feel like that? How can we tackle this? I‚Äôm scared that if I can‚Äôt figure it out, another depressive episode will come and hang around, The last one lasted years.
 
Thanks all.

Hi all,
I've done online tests (and once years ago with a GP) to see if I'm depressed and generally I get results that say it's mild to moderate.
I guess I have been able to hold down a job, relationship and friendship circle so things are manageable and I thought I was just being a hypochondriac or mopey.
But over the past year, I've struggled with losing feelings. Good feelings subside and I can only seem to have negative feelings penetrate. Or worse still nothing gets through. I had to postpone my wedding due to COVID and I just couldn't feel the sadness or stress about it all, I was just empty. Same with other areas of my life that should make me happy or excited or angry, I just feel empty.
Right now, my relationship seems to be over and I'm just so tired of either feeling hopeless about the future and life in general. Things that made me feel happy before like travel, video games, movies and exercise just seem like so much work now. And I'm tired of the only feelings I have that seem to stick being negative ones like anxiety or stress.
I know a GP or online tests are still going to say I'm not severely depressed or anxious but I feel like things are getting slowly worse over time, not better. I have friends that get so excited over life milestones like buying a house or even just for a movie coming out and I just feel myself slipping slowly away from sharing those feelings.
I don't know what I'm asking for here and I'll read through the forums tonight, but I guess I just wanted a place to share as I've told nobody how I feel.
For ten years I was in a relationship looking after someone with depression and it was exhausting and ultimately failed (prior to current partner) but I didn't think I would start to find myself in the same boat. I hated that she seemed to find comfort in depression or made excuses of why she in particular couldn't exercise or make friends but now I find myself feeling an awful sense of comfort in this place I'm in, even though I hate it.
Thanks for listening.

Hello, this is my first post to this site. I was sitting here again in the ""AM"" hours, feeling lost. I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2, 18 years ago; since then I have lived a life full of highs and lows, but for the past 2 years I have lived with the symptoms of severe depression. I am on antidepressants, but I can't see any hope. I sleep most days and am awake half the night. Sleeping is my only escape from my feeling of emptiness. I don't feel like my life is of any benefit to anyone. I don't enjoy a sunny day, or a walk in fresh air...nothing brings me joy. In the past I might feel like this for a few weeks, but we are talking years now. I have a psychiatrist and psychologist, but I can't feel any improvement. I have thought of suicide, but I promised my 17 year old son, I would never leave him. My head tells me to read or go for a walk etc, but I can't move. I am stuck in a way I have never been stuck before. I don't want to see people. I hide away, hoping that one day I will wake up and the clouds would have moved. I have been on a dozen different antidepressants over the years. Has anyone ever had any success with ECT? The longer I am like this, the more unlikely I feel that my life will improve. I know many will tell me to exercise, go to sleep early...I just can't move. I go days without showering and just eat junk when I am awake. Not sure if my rambling makes any sense. I am just lost. Love yourself, I hear people say. I don't even know where to begin. Thanks for listening.

I cant believe I‚Äôm writing this because I hate talking about myself but it‚Äôs gotten to the point where I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I have been feeling so down since 2016 like any small inconvenience makes me cry since my dad has put my self esteem so damn low. Like he‚Äôs constantly putting me down and comparing me to others and calling me fat and naggy and whiney. That‚Äôs not even a quarter of all the derogatory terms he‚Äôs used. But I still love him so much. I cant stand when people say he‚Äôs rude or he‚Äôs got issues. Like that makes me want to punch them for calling my dad such things. I am so sad and unmotivated for everything. I cant even eat and I constantly get migraines. I‚Äôm surprised tears even flow these days because of how much I break down. I don‚Äôt have any close friends to talk about this with. I don‚Äôt have a mum who I can talk about it with. I just feel so alone and unwanted. I wish i was good at something, anything. I used to be a really bright student and I used to play so much sports but I suddenly gained so much weight from stressing about getting into uni and now I just lost all motivation to do anything that used to make me happy like reading and watching movies. I just want to lie in bed all day and not do anything. But I can‚Äôt. Every morning I‚Äôm woken up at 7:30 and on the weekends if I sleep after 9 I am made to think I did something so wrong. Please tell me I‚Äôm not alone in this. I cant be the only one whose own family puts down and made to feel so low and guilty for everything.

Hi there,

Is there anyone out there who feels a bit left out regarding Uni because they are doing reduced course loads because they can't have antidepressants (a case of antidepressant induced hypomania) and had semesters off and don't have a part time job because parents are supporting you.

Like for instance, I'm doing a interdisciplinary major and someone asked about the major on Facebook and said that they were thinking about a club....

Anyway, two people were like maybe start a club.... then they looked into the paperwork and were like no....

And then they were like ""I work part time""...

I suggested informal meetups but less than 5 people turned up...

Problem is there's a not particularly active slack channel for a group for honours, masters and PhD students re Australia in the field.... and slack channels for professionals in the field...

The bad thing about the major there are only two specific courses and I've already done those....

I thought maybe I should pay someone to talk about stuff relating to this major but my mother was like you probably are smarter .... But you need to use it or lose it

Also I did try to make connections this semester before covid-19 hit and the people only contacted me to ask about assessment items...

So yeah wondering whether part time students with good mental health and a job have an external group of friends..

Or whether they lie about their courseload...

Hi all,
First of all, thanks for having me.
 For as long as I can remember I've felt like I just don't fit in, this has left me feeling like an observer of life rather than a participant. I watch other people interact with each other and it seems very fluid, with me it feels clunky like having to think about every step you take whilst walking.
When I was just a kid I was pretty much always alone, feeling as if no one liked me so I figured if I mimic the person I was with they would like me, unless they didn't like themselves. It kind of worked and became my coping mechanism. The problem is I never really developed my sense of  ""self"" I didn't know who I was and I still struggle with that. 
I never developed a strong sense of self, feeling as if part of me is dead. This has left me a very closed down person, causing depression & anxiety. I find it hard to show emotionally how I'm feeling to others, even my own family. I know how I should feel but I find it hard to show. The closer the relationship the more anxious I feel.
I feel like a bad person because of this. There's a part of me that must unconsciously tell myself I'm not allowed to be happy. 
Thanks for reading.

I guess I'm just wondering how others have gotten over the fear/ guilt/ shame of asking for help? I used to think I knew lots about mental health/ warning signs and that I would seek help if needed but it seems like that's not the case. I can't even work up the courage to call the Beyond Blue support number or use the 'chat online' feature, let alone book an appointment for a GP. 
For years I've had bouts where I have a lot of issues with things like self-loathing, feelings of inadequacy, sadness, apathy and thoughts of my own, family and friends mortality. I have a really good life and there's not really much for me to complain about so I become frustrated when I think on these things. I know that everyone experiences these thoughts at times and I shouldn't compare myself with others but I just feel that how can I be upset when my life is good? I have loving parents, a handful of friends that still stay by me even when I don't respond for a while, a job that I love, a house I own, I've travelled lots in my life and don't have money issues. I present as a cheery person to those that know me and when I'm not hating myself I'm a pretty optimistic person. I'm still able to function well and mask my issues in public. I've thought about suicide, but only as a curiosity - what would it be like if everything just disappeared? I know that if I did seek help my friends, family and workplace would all be supportive but I still can't bring myself to do anything, even as I sit in my bed crying on a Monday night and hating myself (again). 
So I just want to know, how did you first go about seeking help, especially if you didn't feel like you deserved it?

Hi all,
I hope everyone is ok. I can't get out of my head (please don't recommend meditation - I just can't do it, I've tried and it just doesn't help...)
 I have a long history of mental illness and managed to pull myself out of this. I have a corporate career, my own home which I saved for in my 20s (I am 30), a loving partner, loving parents, a small group of friends, and my physical health. I've managed to keep my job during COVID-19 and have stayed safe. Relative to others' circumstances, I'm doing very well and am very lucky. I acknowledge that. 
BUT there is something in my head that says I am JUST lucky, and that I don't contribute anything meaningful in my life, that I haven't earned anything and I owe the world, that I am only as good as what I achieve and contribute. 
I'm not actually GOOD at anything. Volunteer work? I don't know how to help people, and I'm conscious of having a ""savior"" complex. Do something meaningful for humanity? I don't know how to do that. Get a career that actually makes the world a better place? I'm not sure I'm so talented. Do art? My creativity is nil. Help Mum out with lunch? No, she prefers my partner helping with that. (Just go watch TV...)
Despite my luck and privilege, I'm not sure I'm actually good at anything. I'm struggling on projects at work, I believe I should be further into my professional and personal development by  now, I haven't done anything ""good"" during COVID-19 like volunteer work...
Long story short. I believe I'm incapable. I'm mediocre. After a childhood of being told I'm smart and going places, I've learned it's a lie; and now, I don't know what to do. If I'm good at nothing, am incapable of helping or doing good, then where do I go from here? Am I going to live the rest of my life distracting myself with trivialities while the people around me actually bring value to the world? (For instance, my partner is a healthcare worker, I have relatives who are chief executives, etc)
Despite all my luck (a roof over my head, food in my belly, and love), I still feel a lump in my throat. I'm good for nothing...
Where to from here?

Hi, Im Roxy, 37yr single, lonely female from WA, diagnosed with depression 18 months ago. I have a great job, financially stable, but like others have gone through some trauma in my time from death, to relationships etc.
I suppose an accumulation of things may have led to my depression. I don't like talking about it with people I know, 1. because I'm an introvert and keep things to myself, but 2. mainly because I don't feel like my friends would understand. Yes they would be supportive and helfpul, but they wouldn't understand. I feel like only people who are experiencing similar things to me, may be able to relate and understand, which i why I am giving this forum a go.
I guess the main thing i wanted to get off my chest is how I'm feeling...I feel like every day is a struggle to get out of bed, and I can't wait to get in it. How incredibly hard it is to put one foot in front of every second, of every minute of every hour of every day, let alone find the strength to place the other foot in front of the first one. I operate on autopilot everyday, zombie like, getting from A to B is a blur, Im not present in the moment, the lights are on but nobodys home. Every breath feels so painful. And every breath I try to take in feels like it never even reaches my chest when I inhale. Im afraid of the next day being the same as every other day-pointless, lonely, a waste. I just feel so lost, empty-yet heavy.
When i find something-anything that makes me happy, I grab it, cherish it, nourish it, real on it and depend on it. Which ends up being to my detriment because somehow whatever made me happy-which I needed to feel validated-worth something, always seems to slip away. And I end up in this deep dark hole....

So lately I have been thinking a lot about how depression affects my  lovelife. It's kind of embarassing for me so I guess its hard to talk when its not anonymous, I am hoping some of you guys will have some insight for me or even just encouragement and empathy. Feel free to share any similar stories as well.
33 years old female and never had a REAL romantic partner though I had some sort of romances with codependant guys I attached myself to, you know... its complicated. I don't feel like I do that anymore, which is great, I am in a much better place managing friendships and other relationships now but its still hard to imagine what a healthy love would look like because I still struggle with depression, anxiety and extreme mood swings.
I want to be honest with people and have that feeling of ""I am relaxed, this is me and I am accepted for me"" but I don't want to completely lose control and start getting all weird and codependent and needy like I have in the past. I struggled a LOT with boundaries and my mood swings are just SO extreme guys its really hard for other people to cope getting too close. But honestly its hard to imagine what healthy love would look like, I have never seen it and I sometimes worry its not even possible for me to ever be with someone romantically. But my mental health issues are fairly persistent / chronic so waiting to just get cured means basically accepting I can't be that close to someone. I don't know, maybe that's what I have to do?

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm new to dealing with my thoughts and emotions & new to forums. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm suffering from anxiety and depression and probably have been for years. If I am completely honest I have feelings of dread, fear, sadness constantly. I have panic attacks that make me feel like I‚Äôm drowning. I haven‚Äôt slept more than 3 hours a night without self medicating with alcohol and tablets for years. It has taken a pretty rubbish year at work for it to unravel me and decide I need help, I‚Äôm booked in with the gp tomorrow to see where I should go from here. I am the funny/bubbly one at work and with my friends so I‚Äôve not got many people to talk to about this to, and I‚Äôve run out of energy pretending to be happy-go-lucky me anymore, i feel like a massive fraud. I work in healthcare and it feels all kinds of wrong to admit I need help.

I am fast spiraling into a depressive episode. I have bipolar. I am normally very stable as long as I have limited stress in my life.
At present I have nothing but stress.
I have medical issues that generally cause me some stress but they have now been compounded with the potability of yet another surgery.
I own my own home and I have my parents living with me to help me and it also helps them. My father invited my eldest brother to come live with us a few months ago. Not wanting the stress of the argument I agreed.
My brother has a history of violence towards us and is also mentally unstable.
He has starter doing things that he knows that trigger me and has escalated to damaging my things tv's and such and blaming it on our elderly mother. Which is not possible because she does not come into the rooms of mine. He has done this same routine many times in the past and I know it gets worse from here..
I have told him he has 5 days to find himself somewhere else to live. He laughed at me like it was a joke. He is now calling agencies and people to do everything he can to stop me from kicking him out.

I am so scared he is going to flip out and not leave and make everything as hard as possible and I have no idea how to fix it and so know very well I am going to spiral into either a severe depression or even worse on of my very very troubling manic episodes.
I don't know who to turn to, who to go to, who can help me and how I can save myself from spiraling out of control!
I'm so scared of losing it after so many years of a clean run.

Hi all, new member here! I'm a straight male in my early 40's. I'll got to the chase and say that I've had lifelong difficulties with ""rising to the occasion"" and this has lead to frequent periods of despair, worthlessness and self-recrimination. After a very nice date last night, which lead to a bit of fooling around, I was again unable to perform and my mood today is... not good. Some suicidal ideation there too and not for the first time. I actually howled like some sort of wounded animal when I got home. Just feeling like a failure and less of a man, I guess.  I want female love and affection but I feel I can't provide for them in quite a basic area. I have got two children so things have - occasionally - worked down there, I just no longer know whether my anxiety has caused this issue, whether the issue has caused the anxiety... it's all just a mess. Any help anyone can spare or even some random thoughts would be brilliant. Cheers.

I have been struggling for many years with a feeling of total fatigue.  My doctor hasn't been helpful whilst I have been complaining about it for many years.  I'm just dead inside.  I can't change GP's as this is a rural area and the others are even worse - ah suck it up, get over yourself, you can't afford private health insurance do therefore you don't deserve medical care etc etc.  There aren't a large number of GP's to choose from.  I don't handle medication well. Since I have been living in public housing, I have been subjected to repeated violence, including sexual assault.  The police refuse to record the incidents so I am called a liar every time I complain about things.  We don't have any psychologists that bulk bill on a mental health plan.  So I don't know where to turn.  I know that if something isn't done about the violence I will probably be killed, my next door neighbor threatens me continuously.  I got an AVO on him and he breached it several times, but could i get anything done about it?  Not on your life.  So now I get evicted and lose all my belongings and he keeps the roof over his head and laughs at me while he continues to threaten and I get called liar liar when I complain.  I get told ""you won't engage with services"".  You bet your life I won't when they are threatening to have my licence removed for medical ground with no medical evidence.  I have been talking with my GP and he says there is no reason for me to have my licence removed plus this same service was trying to force me to agree to allow them to have me diagnosed as psychotic no consult required. If I find out who they were gonna get to do that, that person is gonna be struck off.  I also have a number of physical problems

Over the past 4 months I've been going through a change in meds to try and kick depression being worse in the morning.
It's been a tough road and it feels like it's not going to get any easier. Along with almost continuous depression rollercoaster emotions and mornings still being bad, my anxiety is smacking me about as well. My moods aren't very good and I've been close to the bottom of the dark hole where I fear I will end up in hospital. 
My memory is bad, which is humiliating at work and concentration is up and down. I haven't told my employer too much except that I'm having a tough time and my memory is affected. Other than that I really don't know what to tell them
I've got a psychiatrist and psychologist that I am seeing.
I'm feeling exhausted from the constant battle and roller coaster, living from moment to moment trying to keep my head above water.
I guess I needed to check in here to be reminded that I'm not alone.

Up until almost 3 weeks ago life for me was normal. I was going to work and doing my usual daily things despite whats going on with covid 19. I considered myself lucky and should be grateful i still have a job. 
Then i fell down stairs, broke my foot and tore 2 ligaments. 
I thought that after a week or 2 id be fine and back to work, easy as! But no! Im now sitting here in so much pain with a cam boot on and requiring crutches. I havent been able to work for the past 3 weeks and the dr said ill need at least another 2 weeks off. Ill start physio next week which im dreading due to the pain.

The last couple days i feel like whats happened and what will happen is finally sinking in and really starting to stress me out. I cant work, i cant drive, my university degree may need to be put on hold if im not fit for placements, im lucky im also on austudy otherwise id be ruined financially right now, im scared that this injury will affect my career. Im so over it!
The fact that work hasnt been too kind about it also makes it a whole lot worse. The coworkers i thought i was close with enough to call friends havent even checked in on me. Even my own friends have been a bit absent in checking in.

All the people who were complaining about being in lockdown while i was thinking theyre lucky they get to stay home and be lazy while i was out there working as a registered nurse caring for the elderly. I now know their frustration of having to stay home! I now know how being home almost 24/7 makes your mental health decline, how the uncertainty of your circumstances can affect your mental health in such a short period of time.

If i could, i would straight away make an appointment with my psychologist to talk and cry over everything that happened to me in the past few weeks but thats not possible for me right now not only due to my inability to get anywhere but also because it costs to much. So im putting my little rant here.

I know things will find a way to work themselves out, i always try to see the positives on the worst circumstances. There was a reason i had this injury and the timing of it, im almost glad it happened when it did and not in the middle on a placement for my degree later in the year...

Hi everyone hope you are all coping alright in these difficult times.
There are times that I feel absolutely normal and positive, which normally last 3-6 months then out of nowhere I would lose motivation to do anything, withdrawing from people, feeling down for no reason, for about weeks to a month. Then I would start to feel better and then it hit me again. I think it has been going on and off for about 2 years. Has anyone experienced something similar or am I just being emotional? I am so confused about myself. Thank you.

Just diagnosed with Lupus
After 5 years of dealing with pain and fatigue I found myself bedridden, unable to care for my 5 month baby or 9 yo severely autistic son. 5 years ago I had abnormal bloods and was advised to see a rheumatologist because of the joint pain but I put that on hold due to going through a divorce as well as my then 4 year old son being diagnosed with severe autism at the same time. I put my health on the back burner and now it is all catching up to me. On plaquenil and prednisolone but they aren't doing much. I have always been able to white-knuckle it through the pain and just get on with it but lately the fatigue has me in bed any chance I get. I am halfway through my Computer Science degree at uni and can't fathom going back in this state, I struggle enough to do basic self-care tasks and look after my children. I also have ""lupus fog"". My brain just doesn't work properly anymore. I don't know how I am going to write code at uni or type with how stiff and sore I am should I even find the energy to return.

Homeschooling my autistic son
This has been so hard. Love him with all my heart but at 9 years old I am still wiping his bum and he communicates at the level of a 4 year old. He was non verbal until 6. At the end of the day, at 1am when the baby has finally gone down for the night, I dread going to bed, because I can't believe the day is already over and it is almost time to wake up and to it all over again. 

I had been going so well...
It has been 2-3 years since I last went to therapy for depression. I left my toxic marriage, got remarried, had a baby and the highs are high but the lows sure are low and part of me sometimes misses being a single mum. Thought I had the fairy tale ending and was happy in life, in my marriage, smashing it at uni getting HDs in most of my units. To discover major porn addiction and lies from my husband as well as other issues. I hate family dinners. Sit there with my mouth shut because I only want his family to ever see the best in him and I don't want to be the one to say something that would tarnish their view of him. He tells his mum our fights and it bothers me. She only knows one side to the story/will defend him anyways because he is her son. He can't understand why I now dislike family dinners when I feel like I am putting a fake smile on and sitting in the lions den...out of characters

I have had depression and anxiety on and off for most of my life. I speak with a psychologist weekly, take anti-depressants. Before Corona, I had been doing pretty well. I had a lot of things that I enjoyed or was looking forward to in life. 
Now I‚Äôm so depressed again. I‚Äôm not coping with home schooling or even just having the kids at home. I miss all the things I used to enjoy, like meeting up with friends, going out for dinner, going to the shops. My kids are given so much work and my son fights doing home school. I have no time or mental energy to do anything else in the house. 
My husband is helping as much as he can with the home school at the moment. A huge point of contention between us is that he wants us to continue lockdown until there is a vaccine or cure for covid 19. Things are meant to be opening back up a bit to see friends and family. He said we can see our parents only because we can trust they are careful outside. He doesn‚Äôt want me to meet with friends or let our kids see their friends. He doesn‚Äôt want the kids to go back to school while covid19 is still around. I just feel so hopeless. I just want some normalcy back.

Hey everyone,

I've been doing a lot of thinking about everything lately. My life, this pandemic, my past, present and future and I just wanted to say I'm disappointed in myself.

I'm exhausted with my depression, anxiety and ocd. Apart from clearing out stuff from the house (So my parents and I can sell our house and move) as well as studying a diploma of travel and tourism online I don't do much else. I want to read more, watch more movies, maybe play more video games but I can't be bothered too. I sometimes cry for a couple of hours at night about negative statements people have said to me in the past and my sleeping is all over the place.

I just feel like I've wasted my 20s and some of my best years in general. I'm 26 and haven't gotten my act together and haven't enjoyed a lot of things in life. Damn, I feel old.

Another thing is before this pandemic started is that I came up with a 5 year plan that I thought would be achievable. After all of this I'm not so sure about anything anymore.

One of my goals is to publish some short stories and possibly become a screenwriter in the future (I'm studying a Bachelor of Arts next year) but I don't know how to go about making that happen. To be fair it's probably a 10-15 year plan for that one but it feels like a pipe dream that's never going to happen along with some of my 5 year goals like making friends, having a girlfriend or getting a job.

Maybe I'm not meant to make friends, get a girlfriend or be happy. I just seem to piss a lot of people off and more importantly I piss myself off. I continually think "" What is wrong with me?"" and when people don't like me I blame myself constantly. I was also rejected at tafe by a girl last year who I was starting to trust along with a couple of other people too. Now I don't trust anyone and just assume if people are nice to me that they want help with something (That's a whole other story I'm not going to get into)

It feels tiring to be me (Even before this pandemic started) I also want to add that maybe it's okay if I'm not happy. I have pretty low self esteem and am socially inept so it feels like I never quite fit in and whether that continues or not I just don't know.

I have thought about suicide but to be honest I would never kill myself. Sometimes my brain and heart just hurt a lot I guess when I think about all of this.

Thanks for reading,

John

Hi everyone,
So I know that due to everything that's going on in the world right now, I know that there is probably a lot worse and far off going on right now. But this is something that I have been wanting to discuss for a while now, and something that I feel like not many people talk about.
So a few months ago I started seeing a phycologist that my sister had recommended to me. I've had severe depression years now but it had mainly triggered again, after the first guy who I fell for completely started ignoring me, so basically I had felt like trash at the time and I had lost two really close friends of mine at the time.
after that the first phycologist I ever saw seemed like she was always in a hurry, the next one I saw were nice but more felt like I was in a job interview, the one after that seemed to more forget things that I would tell her.
so for a while I had felt like giving up and not bothering for a while and had just managed to cure a lot of things myself. 
I was so focused now on other things, getting my life on track, stressful job etc, that boys weren't even on my mind and was more wanting to get my mental health on track. But then I had accidentally met someone as you do.
To cut a long story short, we had connected straight away, had long conversations on the way to work, ended up asking me out, went really well, dropped me home, told me that he will see me in the usual spot that we meet up, talked a bit that night-then poof! Never heard from him again.
So I just thought the normal thing, weren't actually nterested in me, just wanted one thing etc. But he had told me that night that he might have cancer, but he wouldn't talk about it and there were times when he had looked unwell.
So a part of me thought that it was a lot to do with that, or if he was just completely ghosting me. But because he was genuinely really sick, and did not know what was going on I ended eventually confronting him as nervous as I was, asking him if he was okay, then I would be able to move on.
I ended up telling my phycologist this story, because even my friend's and family who were just as pessimistic as me told me that I did the right thing.
However my phycologist said a lot of rude things to me and came across really rude to me. I left the session feeling completely humiliated!
I was just wondering if this sort of thing had ever happened to anyone or if anyone had a similar experience at all?? I was left for words and felt completely modified!!

Hi everyone,
It's been months that I'm going through depression and anxiety.  It first happened to me few years back. 
Somehow fought it and came out of it slowly. But it came back with more power.
Every time when I go through this phase I isolate from everything that I love, isolate me from friends. 
Because its the experiences I had made me like this. So the inner me doesn't wanna face that again.
For me, the hardest part of depression is accepting that I'm going through depression and I can't work or act like normal days.
Because I grew up in a world where the word 'depression'  'anxiety' is something people doesn't want to talk about.
Sometimes I accept I'm having depression and I will get out of this one day and be more strong.  And not everyone is lucky enough to go through this. One positive thing I could get from this phase I can totally relate to what another person facing depression is going through.

Here I am trying the find one single positive thing desperately and people around me laughing at me. 
I know its hard to understand what I'm going through. But can you at least stop judging something you don't know?
When I took the courage to accept my mental state, I have people around me calling me liar and someone who is seeking attention.
I shut down myself from everything and I was isolating myself from everything and what I got is 'LIAR'.
And I'm starting to doubting myself whether I made all this up. No, I didn't. I do have some traumatic events in my life. Maybe it's silly for others, But I couldn't take it. Because I always wished a simple world where I can feel secure, I can be myself. No there is no such world!

I'm hoping for a world where Depression is not a taboo. And someone won't laugh at me when I tell them I'm going through depression!
I have been seeing nightmares. But these days the biggest nightmare is the friend who laughed at me when I said him I'm having depression and people calling me a liar.

Can someone give me a break? I'm not able to solve my real problem in the midst of these!!
Best

Hi all,
Got a few things going on that has me quite shaken and not knowing what to do.  Need to disclose right at the top that I have had battles with clinical depression on and off for my entire adult life, however the issues that are affecting me now are not those I've experienced previously.
I am in my mid 40's, and been in a job for the last 15 years.  However, the last few months have seen me no longer happy with the work I've been doing (no real surprise considering how long I've been there).  There is also no scope for any career progression or options amongst any other teams within the business for me to explore.  Also, there is a person in my team I have issues with as she has exhibited bullying behaviour toward me and left me feeling like I no longer belong.  Considering the team I am in only has 6 members, this is a major issue.  If you are wondering, I have reported this to my team leader and he has had a word with her, but that was right before we started working from home due to COVID-19 so no idea whether anything that's been said will make things better.  As this person is getting more and more responsibilities within the team, I suspect not.
So, I am in a job I no longer enjoy doing, and even if I was working in an office still feel extremely isolated and just feel I have to get out.  However, I have nothing to go on to (in part due to our current environment), and don't have enough funds to survive without employment for an extended period of time.  Therefore, I feel like I'm stuck.  Do I stay where I am, putting up with everything I've mentioned just to ensure some sort of job security and a steady income, or do I leave that bad situation behind and risk not getting anything for months or worse, years.
That is my dilemma at the moment.  Not expecting any help on this, but if anyone has constructive ideas on this that would be great to hear.
Thank you for reading.

hi all
im a 30yr old male and started my first ever mental health plan last yr just before chrissy. originally i went to my gp as my wife said my mental health hasnt been great and that she thought i needed to see someone to talk about it. i really struggle to not only show emotion but to understand and pick up when i am feeling emotions and what the emotion is. this along with my lack of motivation, always feeling tired and feeling like noone really cares or understands has gotten me to where i am now. is it normal for people to not feel emotions?? also is it possible to not be thinking anything? unfortunately because of all this my marriage is heading south, we have 2 kids together and 1 step child and it feels like im losing everything i hold dear. i had started seeing a mental health professional but for some reason i was expecting him to have answers for me like if this was a maths sum. hoping that 1+1=2 and he would go this is how we fix it. my deepest fear now is that maybe i have never actually felt or shown emotions but rather mimicked and faked them to what i think they should be which makes me feel like a complete phony.
has anyone else had these problems and how do i go about finding answers
thankyou in advance and i hope everyone is doing well

I have had major depressive disorder for almost 10 years now and was managing it very well for a long time. But the last few weeks of isolation have really been a significant challenge. Prior to isolation, I broke up with my boyfriend, which I don't regret as I did not love him anymore. I also moved out of my parents house and was so excited for the new things my life was offering. Then it all changed when I lost my job to COVID, my studies went online and could not see my friends anymore. 
The last week has been one of the biggest mental struggles I've encountered yet. I am so, so depressed and lacking motivation to do anything. I have almost no appetite, and struggle to cook/eat even though I have a fridge full of fresh food. I get out of bed, make myself my normal breakfast and just can not stomach it. I have no motivation to do anything, and am really struggling to get out of bed each morning. I've been waking up crying, and have major crying fits throughout the day over nothing. 
I am trying so hard to be proactive and have made an appointment with my GP and brought my psychiatrist appointment forward. However I am just struggling with the lack of human connection. In the past I have relied on friends and family to help me through the tougher times and it's far too difficult to do this over social media. 
Is anyone feeling in a similar place due to the isolation and restrictions? I am sure I am not alone, and it would be really great to hear from others about how they are coping. 
Thank you all for reading x

Hi,
I am new to the forum. Since last few weeks I am going through terrible time and it has now reached to a level where I feel so stressed and depressed that I cannot at times breath.
 I am suddenly treated strangely at work. I was removed from a project and someone with similar designation and lesser experience was given the opportunity. There was no communication from my management, keep in mind I am pretty high on designation, so my reporting management are the State operational heads. I am shut down when I tried to reach out and ask ‚Äú why?‚Äù. My hours were reduced, while keeping this other person full time because allegedly she/ he has work - which actually is my project handed over to her/ him.  They are avoiding me in every possible manner, including the HR. I am very passionate about my job and have always been highly productive. 
Never in my life have I felt so belittled, humiliated. I have no say in my own job now. 

I have my family abroad, with Covid 19, I am super worried about them and the fact that in case of emergency I cannot even go there- makes the situation worse.
i am usually very strong and do not really share matters with anyone. Solving my problems myself is the way it has always been.
But, first time in life , I don‚Äôt know what to do. This feeling of being ‚Äú worthless & helpless ‚Äú is killing me. I feel like running away , but I also need the job to put food on tables both here and back home. It took me a lot of internal fight to convince myself to join the forum and write this. So thank you to anyone who might be reading this. I have no idea what to do next!!!!
 Thanks

I've been seeing this guy for three months and we're both in our early 20's so we're still both quite young. Things were going extremely well I've never met someone like him and we both had such amazing times together. The past two and half weeks something was really off about him and I was super worried, I spoke to his friends and they noticed that something was off too. He was shutting everyone out and wouldn't answer messages or calls so it worried me. He's a very closed person so he finds it rather difficult to open up to people and I had only known him three months so I didn't expect him to tell me what was wrong. I eventually was able to catch up with him in person and he told me that he's severely depressed. I was so proud of him for opening up and I reassured him that it's okay to not be okay and that he had to get help and go and see someone which he agreed. We both then made the decision to stop seeing each other because he didn't think it was fair how he had 'treated' me and he wanted to be able to find happiness and love within himself before he could love someone else which I completely agreed with. It's such a tough situation because no one did anything wrong, it wasn't anyone's fault and we still have such strong feelings for one another but we just can't be together right now. He told me not to wait for him and to try and move on because it's not fair if he holds me back but I'm finding it really hard right now because I have such strong feelings for him. 
Obviously we've completely cut contact and I told him I'll always be there for him if he ever needs to reach out but I feel so helpless and lost and I don't know what to do. I so badly want to message him once a month to check up but I know I need to respect his space and his decision. It sounds extremely selfish but I don't know whether I should wait for him or to try and move on because I've never met someone like him and I don't want to give up just yet because he's so strong and I know he'll find happiness.

I've posted on here a few times in the past, I don't know if this time is worse but I suppose that doesn't really matter. I've had depression and depression-like symptoms since I was 9 and here I am again after things have been getting worse in the past few weeks. 
I'm 19, have been living out of home since early February and thought I was coping with everything. I've started losing motivation for everything that goes on in my life. I'm weeks behind on uni with two assignments due in the next few days with so much left to do. Then another two in the next few weeks. I know I have to do them, and I want to do well, but I can't bring myself to get out of bed. I've always been really into running and at state league level in my sport but since I took a few weeks off to heal my knee, then getting sick as well, I cannot be bothered to even go for a walk. I have no desire to eat food or drink water. My sport has always motivated me no matter what, until now. I thought it was my future, but I've completely fallen out of love with it. A lot of the time when I feel down I cannot really describe what exactly it is that's bothering me. I just feel dazed and like I don't really care what happens.
I've had some really bad nights recently. Then last night it got worse. I found out my boyfriend had been flirting with another guy. Initially I was telling myself it wasn't my fault. But now I just feel so worthless and that if I was a good partner to him, then maybe he wouldn't have done it. Despite everything going on, my relationship was going great. I really felt like I was in love with him. Now I can't trust him, and I don't know if I should end the relationship. I'm divided on that.
So yeah, my motivation for simple tasks, my hobbies, and for living a healthy lifestyle has gone out the window. Everyday I lie in bed with no energy to do anything. I know I should start with getting my eating habits back to normal, but I can't bring myself to do it.
For anyone reading, I appreciate that you've gotten this far. Hope you are all doing okay. I'm grateful for this community

For almost a year now i have been feeling numb and lonely. I have a partner of 2 years and i constantly feel like i'm not enough. he pays more attention to his phone than to his family. We have a 15mo and it is tough. I don't know how to cope with everything. I try talking but he doesn't understand life with anxiety and depression. I know i have been snapping but after losing my grandmother a year ago, i feel so lost and broken. (he wasn't there to support me and help me when i needed and i feel this pushed me away). I had to remain strong for everyone (because thats's how i cope). now i just want to feel something, anything. All i can feel is pain. I have self-destructed and with the pressure and stress of this virus i don't know how to be okay. I have tried to explain when i snap its because i am scared and need reassurance, he just doesn't understand and it makes me feel like a monster. he has called me over dramatic and said i'm taking it overboard. I feel the stress of everything and i just don't know how to feel safe and normal. I'm trying to protect my daughter and myself, yet he makes me feel crazy.  I know i am pushing him away because i have been hurt in the past and i never want to allow anyone to hurt me anymore. 
After a small argument he said he started packing his bags to go until i can stop being paranoid with the virus. That just broke me and i have ended things. I don't feel anything. I am numb, i just don't know whether i still love him.  I should feel hurt and sad, but i don't,  i feel nothing. I feel so out of control and like i don't know what i want because i can't feel anything. I feel so lost because i can't even make decisions in my life based on my emotions because i feel nothing :( How do i feel things again i just want this feeling to go away.

It sneaks up on you, in such a way you're kind of used to it.  And then you come to a point where you want to cry so badly but you're numb, and you want to hurt yourself to externalise the pain.  
I guess I have a lot to be grateful for.  I'm blessed with an awesome kid with whom I have a great relationship.  I've got a home and I don't need to worry about being kicked out by the landlord etc  . 
But, this feeling of failing and hopelessness is so overwhelming I'm physically weakened by it.   I despair at how I'm not able to provide my son the opportunities that I think he deserves.  He is such a smart and special child.  I'm deeply ashamed that he sees me in the state of weakness and he worries about me and wants to help.  
My biggest embarrassment is my work/job situation.  I simply don't know how to break out and improve my earning capacity.  I stare at my CV and don't know how to sell myself.  I suppose my confidence is just completely shattered.  Have been doing 2 jobs over the last few years, and neither brings good money or growth.  And yet I have no real prospect of doing something completely different.  If you ask me what I have passion for, I don't even know what it's like to have passion for anything.   I think I'm so sick and tired of myself asking the same questions over and over again, and never have had clarity and sense of direction.   I feel I'm eternally lost and stuck in the void.
I am mostly happy to be by myself, I guess I do still love life.  And yet there are moments I so crave to have someone to confide to, someone to bounce ideas off, someone to laugh with, or simply someone to give me a cuddle.  I don't even know where to begin in finding that special someone.  Tried online dating, seasons come seasons go.  As much as I can approach it with good humour, open mind and general compassion, I find it harder and harder to not be cynical.  
I always believe that life in itself is the most previous thing and worth living.  But this pain, numbness, sense of despair and hopelessness is hard to shake off.   Is it simply somethings one should learn to live with?  Stoicism?
I guess I still dream of shining my light in some way.  I just don't know what that way is, and worry that the flickering is getting too dim.

Most of the time my partner of 2+ years is in a really good mood, he makes jokes & acts silly, exercises, is really affectionate and caring.

But a couple of times a month, or sometimes even once a week, his mood suddenly takes a nose dive. For a couple of days he totally withdraws, stops eating properly, avoids me or when he does talk to me he's cold or even sometimes rude ir snappy. He is in this mood right now, i believe triggered by the stress he is feeling from losing his job due to Covid. Im not sure if it is depression, given typically he'll bounce back to normal within a day or so.

I really feel for him during this tough time, but I am also a sufferer of anxiety and being suddenly ignored and snapped at makes me really stressed.  Its like emotional whiplash. Im trying my hardest to be patient and focus on my own happiness, but it's hard not to feel on edge. Also I'm pregnant with our first child , and it terrifies me as to what will happen if we can't work this out.

I would appreciate any advice as I'm a bit lost on what to do.

Hey all.
I'm a 27yr old gay man, and have been out since I was in my early teens. Throughout most of my school life, I was bullied frequently about being openly gay, which took its toll on my every day life. I feel it is probably a part of the reason I'm here tonight typing this out.
Since leaving school, I've been struggling with self-confidence issues, constant feeling of loneliness, motivation issues, memory decline, lack of concentration, sleeplessness / inability to wake up feeling refreshed, minimal appetite, gaming / movie addiction, distancing myself from family & friends... Even right now I'm struggling to think of what's been going on. The last 10 years or so are, for lack of a better word, blurry. I've even gotten to a point where I was considering contacting the local Army base to see if they would put me through training without being enlisted to join, just to try to snap myself out of this mindset - and to me, that sounds extreme. I've tried seeing a psychologist, at my GPs recommendation, and found that it didn't seem to help me - mainly because of cost, and they would give me 'homework' to do, which doesn't work well with motivational issues. I know change starts with me, as they say, but I simply cannot kick this lazy, lonely, depressing mindset to be able to commit to changing things. Part of me wants to hire my own personal trainer to come around, kick me out of bed each morning and force me into doing things, hence why I thought about the Army training camps.
Loneliness is definitely one of the biggest feelings I have a lot of the time, even when I'm with my closest friends. I often find myself swiping through apps like Grindr, Tinder, Hinge etc trying to find 'Mr Right' in an attempt to soothe the lonely feeling and lack of fulfilment that I have.
Among other issues, I don't even know what career path I would like to follow. I used to have a huge passion for music production, but lost interest in that after I left school. I thought about going into social work recently, as I feel I would excel in that field, especially working with LGBT people, considering I have life experience - but I need to fix myself before I can help fix others, right?
What do I do? I'm totally lost. I can't even save money to move out of home because I compulsively spend. Plus I don't have my license either, but that's a separate issue, or could it be related to my motivation? Who knows.
Any advice, any thoughts - please send them through.
Thanks,
Brendon.

Should I still be feeling so up and down while being on a antidepressants? I don‚Äôt think still having family drama on one side of my family helps which I have no control over and don‚Äôt see the drama ending anytime soon. And still don‚Äôt feel anything since my grandma passed away the same week I started on antidepressants. Sleeping wise has improved since my gp prescribed something to help me sleep at night.

Hi all, 
I was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety when I was 18. Since then I have had many ups and downs and am experiencing another depressive period at the moment.
My partner and I both would love to start a family. It has been a life-long goal of mine as I love working with and being involved with children. 
I'm seeking other people's opinions of experience as I am terrified. I want to be able to provide the adequate care for my baby but am frightened of the depression and what I might be like during and after pregnancy. I also worry about having my children miss out on things due to my mental health.
I spoke with my psychiatrist about it briefly today and he suggested staying on my medications because he thinks it would be too risky to come off them and said it would be safe to do so. 
I had booked an appointment for next week to have my Implanon removed but after feeling so low again recently I'm thinking I'll go in and discuss my concerns with my gp and remove it at a later date when I'm feeling well again. 
Any advice would be great!
Have a nice day ‚ò∫

Hi everyone, 
Just as the title suggests I really dont think anyone can help me. Ever. Life has been down for the past 3 years ranging from failed relationships, financial problems, family drama and so forth. Nothing has ever been great for me at all. I feel like im living my own personal hell. I moved out of my hometown to get a fresh start a few years back but I was wrong. This insane cloud of darkness always follows me around wherever I go. I look at my bestfriend whom I live with and he‚Äôs got it going for him. Picture perfect relationship, little to no family problems, stable job, awesome friends etc. And then theres me. I have no other friends, failed relationships (apparently im not man enough)  boring, lost my job again (not my fault but it always comes down to circumstances like right now with Covid-19). It‚Äôs tough. I can‚Äôt handle it anymore. I can‚Äôt sleep, I rarely eat, I started smoking to calm me down which kind of helps me relax when I feel breakdowns are about to happen. I tried seeking professional help but I ended up getting dumb internet mental exercises because my hormone levels are stable and normal. Why is the world against me? I have no clue. I can‚Äôt count how many times I‚Äôve tried ending it on my own. I‚Äôm so envious of other people. I‚Äôm literally living hell on earth. My own personal hell designed to make me go insane. Now I don‚Äôt know where else to express my feelings. No one believes me. You wanna know why? It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs all in my head. Im literally trying my best. Im just not good enough for anything. Or anyone for that matter... I really don‚Äôt get it. Nothing goes in favour for me at all. Im so frustrated. I get used by people due to my supposed kindness. And according to my friend I‚Äôm not a good person because of my temper. Which rarely comes out but once my long patience is gone I can chew someones head off. Happened when I snapped at him and his friend for not respecting my privacy inside my own house. Im still in the wrong. Im always wrong. Im left handed so maybe thats why nothing is right. In the end im still alone. Theres a huge hole of emptiness inside of me. A void. I can‚Äôt care any less about myself anymore and purposely trying to deteriorate myself instead of the easy way out. That way, at least I can‚Äôt embarrass my parents when I go. I feel like a shadow. I can only be seen in the light but disappears in the darkness. The listener that no one wants to hear out.  In the end, I‚Äôll always be the one that‚Äôs forgotten

Hi there, 
I needed to write my feelings down or thoughts more so. I suffer from Generalised Anxiety and Depression. I've had this since i was in High school, i had several panic attacks where it causes vomiting and i don't eat for a few days. I have ended up in hospital previously as it got bad at one stage i didn't eat anything for 4 days straight barley any water and i was continually throwing up as well. The doctor just gave me IV drips and advised i needed to see a psychologist. I already was previously when it first began, i was not aware of what it was in beginning and went to seek help from a GP he then referred me.
I'm 21 this year i have had a great ease for a few months then i keep getting randomly sucked into the ugly cycle of depression. It would randomly arise and i just struggle under the weight of it, i am still seeing my psychologist (i had taken a break due to covid-19, but had messaged him to make an appt). My mother also has anxiety and i find it hard to communicate with her when i am like this, the rest of my family don't understand what to do or cope with me when im like this. So i tried to pretend when i am near them, i put on a fake smile. I have a best friend who helps me generally during these times, however, i have no one else!... i can't talk to anyone else about this and  i also feel the sense of burden that my anxiety or depression can have.  I am currently studying in my 4th year of Bachelors for teaching, i don't want to take medication as i know there are side affects of it such as addiction. I don't want to cope that way, i tried natural supplements that are supposed to calm the mind and overall balance of mood.  I am honestly just really tried, i feel trapped, weak, hopeless and very anxious. The crazy thing is I'm so mindful aware of what i should do, or could do but i lack the incentive or energy to do this.  Honestly i am just tried of having to repeat this ongoing cycle, it never leaves me alone i'll be really good and control it for a few months for example; 6,  then i'd spiral from something random, like family issues, or stress from everyday life.  This is just a brief summary of my story, thank you for anyone who was able to read this!
Are there any support groups i can join? to have people to chat to about this? any Suggestions?

My husband has had depression for a long time, recognised by me (his wife) and his friends, though hasn't really acknowledged it himself.  I believe it stemmed from bullying at work, which made him oversensitive to any criticism.  It was exacerbated by problems with PE, which again he didn't acknowledge for many, many years and I was to naive to understand in our early relationship.  He's an intelligent man and comes across to others as easy going and funny (very English sense of humour) but at home he can be quite the opposite.  In the past he often would sulk in the bedroom for long hours - he does this less but replaces this with long hours behind screens or going for long cycles. Either way, I am always left minding the kids and doing the bulk of household chores.
We have two kids, who have certainly helped me when I experienced periods of depression (partly as a result of my husband) and though he loves them very much, he can be hypercautious and overly authoritative.  I worry for the kids as they enter their teenage years and become increasingly rebellious.
Although not stated explicitly I know he blames me for his depression.  He wants more intimacy but I don't feel close to him at all because he is often angry, sulking, distracted behind screens and I am genuinely tired and really don't fancy him.  Issues around PE haven't helped, though at least after 20 years it has finally been identified there is physiological (and not just psychological) issue behind this.  In summary, I am genuinely tired and think about when the kids have finished school that I will find my own place.
It's not that I don't care, but have experienced depression more than once in my life.  I got better by acknowledging my depression - it also helped that I really enjoy being a mum and less so a wife at the moment.  I only wish my husband could enjoy just being a father....any advice would be appreciated.

Hi everybody.
This is my first post, so I will try and make it brief. Although I seem to have suffered some form of depression most of my adult life, lately I have noticed it is very hard to have a full 6-8 hours sleep at night. I often have short bursts of sleep for 2-3 hours and then have a short rest during the following day. I wondered if anyone else has experienced similar changes in their pattern of sleep. Hope everyone is finding some comfort in the present pandemic seeming to flatten out.

I've been diagnose wirh depression, anxiety BBD and I exhibit some eating disorder habit..
But not yet been diagnose with an Eating disorder. Now BPD has been mention a few times..
Which makes me depress because no one knows what's wrong with me. 
And I'm just tired of life. Cause I want everything sorted and on track.
But with me losing my crap every 3 or so days I lose hope.  That I will ever be okay.
The question is will I be okay??

hey there,
i made this thread for people who can go through day to day life and get out of bed but still feel empty and sad or just numb/tired/done or anything like that.
depression obviously comes in a lot of different forms but those of you with mild or moderate depression that mostly affects your mental world/motivations/outlook rather than taking a severe toll on your daily requirements are still so extremely valid and deserve as much support and love as you need.
please feel free to talk about any of your experiences/feelings here, open to anyone
love you all üíõ

ive never been able to find a councilor or psychologist who i feel really comfortable with. ive gone to three or four sessions then praised them on how great they are cos theyve cured me and they genuinely seem so pleased with themselves and that reaction shows me they're bullshit and now i really dont feel like i can trust them or any doctor. i really dont know how to find someone i will really be able to talk.
i'm sorry for the ramble. I'm just not sure what else to do. It all just seems so silly really. Sorry and thanks for reading.

I'm a uni student, and I've been taking antidepressants for my depression for about a year now. I was feeling isolated before coronavirus and now classes have moved online its even worse. It takes it out of me to shower and cook myself a decent meal. IM struggling financially. It just seems that my life isn't getting any better. Like I'm stuck in a really awful rut. I messaged my mum saying I feel low and I'm not okay and she told me to take my dog for a walk because exercise releasing endorphins.

I‚Äôm usually stronger than this. Or at least, better at pretending. I don‚Äôt have close friends. I have friends sure but I would never tell them when I‚Äôm struggling. I‚Äôm the strong one. If I don‚Äôt keep it together I‚Äôm afraid I will cry. If I cry I‚Äôm afraid I will never stop. I try so hard. But I‚Äôm just a person. I make mistakes, like anyone else. But if I‚Äôm not doing my absolute best and I fail, I feel like a deserve it. I don‚Äôt let anyone in because I‚Äôm afraid someone will see me deep down and be so disappointed. I haven‚Äôt had a boyfriend for over 10 years. Partly because I need to be ‚Äòtogether‚Äô all the time for my job. I can‚Äôt be weak. And if I have my heart broken again I‚Äôm afraid it will make me waver and fall. If I‚Äôm not good at my job I‚Äôm nothing. I feel like I have nothing or no one else. I work so hard to avoid pain and feel nothing. It‚Äôs an emotional isolation I‚Äôve caused and perfected on my own. Now we‚Äôre all physically isolated I‚Äôm getting worse at pretending I‚Äôm ok.

Hi, 
I'm new here, I would love to to connect with others in similar situation to What I am experiencing atm.
I have major depressive disorder which I have medicated for since late 2016- it's had its ups and downs but I was for ally stable early.this year for the first time in Proably 18 months.
Then COVID19 happened I was lucky enough to remain in a job that I could do from home.then schools.got closed and I became my 2 kids teacher aswell as a fulltime employee!! I wanted to do both well, obviously wanted to support my kids  as best as I can but I also be present and still performing at my best in such a crucial time for my employer.
I was just hanging in there, then I get a call from my dad's nursing home to say he was very unwell and most likely had days to live. Of course I drop everything and rush to be with him. This was last Sunday- i spent two days with him while he was looking very unwell, praying and reassuring him that everything is ok. He has been in a vegetative state for two years and has not spoken or known who I was for that whole time. Then on Tuesday I get a phone call from the NDIS carer that visits him who had not seen him  for a week and wasn't aware of his current situation on the phone to me or cheerful and happy telling me I can't believe it your Dad is TALKING,.and yes he was he said hello to me over the phone. I rushed in there and what do you know he is talking, remembers who I am but seems.to be stuck in a certain year because he keeps.asking what time my Mum will be home (she passed away 6 yrs ago). I speak.to the Sr and she tells.me this is quite normal for palliative patients, they sometimes have has surge or return cognition in.their final.days. the past few days he has remained back to normal not speaking and not awake. He is only  being treated for pain now as he has sepsis following aspiration pneumonia. I've has a week off work and honestly feel like I slipped into depression and all i want to do is be asleep and forget everything. I am an.only child so have to deal with this.on my own, it was the same when my mum passed away. Basically the last 6 years have been he'll.

Hi, Im not too sure what Im trying to achieve by posting on
here. Ive never spoken about my feelings to anyone but I just feel today,
I need to do. Ive always felt pretty flat throughout life but have always
just ‚Äò‚Äôgot on with it‚Äô. Ive tried to keep busy in life. Im educated, I work
full time and I try to do things which I enjoy. As time goes on I‚Äôm
realizing that not much gives me enjoyment anymore (if ever it did). Ive
always tried to put on a happy face but I just feel so tired of pretending.Im 34 now and the older I get the harder things
feel for me. Life just feels like its passing me by. I feel like Im not living,
just existing. I feel so incredibly lonely and worry that this is how I will
always feel. I have a couple of friends here and there and I always try and
organise catch-ups, but being my age, most of my friends have families and are
always busy. I‚Äôm no one‚Äôs priority. A big issue for me is my romantic life. Ive never had a
boyfriend which makes me feel so embarrassed that I avoid talking about it or
even lie. There have been a few guys here and there over the years but nothing
has ever turned serious. I used to think maybe I was just unlucky in love but now
Im pretty sure that the problem is me. I dont think I‚Äôm incredibly ugly, but I
am a quiet person which most men don‚Äôt seem to like. Ive tried dating over the
years, but always seem to get rejected in one way or another. Rejection is hard
for everyone, but for me its such a deeply hurtful thing. Clearly I mustn‚Äôt be
good enough. These days I find Im torn between wanting to spend time with
friends and avoiding it altogether. I cant help but feel so jealous of other peoples
lives and relationships. I get that you cant see problems people might have
but I think these people are so lucky for having something good, even if only for
a short period of time. People always say having a partner isn‚Äôt everything, but for
me its pretty important. I think its a pretty reasonable thing to want in
life. The older I get the more stressed and upset I become because I feel like an
absolute failure of life. It doesn‚Äôt help when I get constantly asked when am I
going to find a boyfriend. It makes me feel even more worthless and I struggle
to hold back the tears. Life is pretty shit when you have no one to share it
with. Sometimes I have great experiences or see beautiful things but what‚Äôs the
point if Im the only one seeing it. Im just sick of feeling this way all the time but really
cant see things changing

I don't know if it's the isolation, or just my head, but I have never felt so alone in my life, and it's not fair. I should be happy, I've come so far from negative things in my life, and I'm still just so sad.
I feel like I don't have anybody to talk to beside my boyfriend, and even though he's happy to help me, I feel like I'm just dragging him down and he doesn't understand, and I've stopped bothering with trying to ask him for help. He always says that his friends are my friends too, but I'm never invited into the conversations, nor have I been invited anywhere with them in the past unless by my boyfriend. Once when I tried to ask, I was sort of just told that ""oh... you can come if you really want to, i guess"", which just made me feel more unwelcome.
I feel like I'm just a person who happens to be there, like a side character in a movie or something, and this hasn't been making mental health feel any better. I feel unwanted.
I have nobody to talk to, and I feel like my mental health is just getting worse and worse. I can't even be bothered to make myself breakfast anymore, or brush my teeth some days.
I just feel so alone, and I don't know what to do.

I feel that down I just feeling like crying. I‚Äôve also been very fidgety and what has been a very slight head tremor through my life has just got really bad and noticeable.

Hi, 
I‚Äôm new to this forum, so please forgive me if I‚Äôm breaking any etiquette. I‚Äôm a female student in my twenties with depression and anxiety. I have some pretty serious avoidant tendencies and insomnia. This along with genes has given me a tendency towards addiction. If something blocks out my brain and helps me sleep I get hooked. It‚Äôs legal stuff and my latest has been the booze. Obviously with what‚Äôs going on anxiety levels are high and it‚Äôs gotten pretty bad and is causing a lot of tension with family. I don‚Äôt know how to talk to them frankly and have a lot of deadlines coming for coursework. There‚Äôs been a big blow-up tonight about it all and I‚Äôm terrified of stopping and facing the insomnia I have had in the past. It‚Äôs my first night sober in weeks and I have an essay due soon. I know my first stop should be the GP but with all this going on it‚Äôs up in the air, and our appointments are so short when I get new scripts. I feel nauseated with guilt and shame. I‚Äôm on a TCA as SSRIs were unhelpful, and I‚Äôve been thinking about what would happen if I took a few more off and on for weeks. Whenever I feel that way I reach for a bottle to make it stop. I feel like if I tell my friends or family they‚Äôd send me somewhere. I guess I don‚Äôt really want to be me anymore. I‚Äôm going to try and sleep now, I‚Äôve taken some drowsy antihistamine and I hope it works.

Hey Everyone,
I have read many of your posts and am impressed with the level of bravery, compassion and honesty being shared. I feel like i have found the right place.
During Covid-19 life, things obviously exacerbate, but I have had a history of depression and anxiety however have not had the best luck with councelors / psychologists and have never been formally diagnosed. I am a stubborn person I guess and feel I have the emotional maturity to ""handle"" it all and try not to burden my loved ones with my pain and struggle... sometimes this can't be helped.
I'm wondering if most women here would agree that hormonal fluctuations can also impact/heighten certain moments of low mental health, and I feel myself in the midst of this. I avoid medications of all types when necessary, and try to turn to health, wellbeing, diet and self care the most.
This post is asking for guidance. My personal life has many ups and downs, complications, children (newly step son and daughter) and my new role as a step parent( which I love while super intimidating and stressful at times), my partner who is very supportive is going through an ugly divorce ( been stung out for years), loss of my job recently, financial pressures etc. We all have things in our lives and I get that. But when the ugly dark head rears, I feel all of the things I try to manage with these things become bigger, uglier, and harder to handle. When I speak about them to my partner they are scenarios I have made bigger in my head based on genuine fears I have. It feel like they can get out of control. I usually have a huge emotional outbursts of crying and overwhelming fear/anxiety and need to express them, then I shut down and need time for myself to recover. Otherwise it's general apathy and faking happy, with a few good times in between.
This puts pressure on my partner. I try so hard to control it. I try to spread these issues out and speak up when they bother me rather than bury them. But I almost feel out of control when it gets bad. I feel misunderstood, very alone and overly sensitive. It impacts and overwhelms my sense of self worth, thinking patterns, daily routine ( I lye in bed all day sometimes), and generally feel ""off the band wagon"".
Please, it would be good to hear from people who actually understand what this feels like. The daily struggle of keeping yourself on track and trying not to be too hard on yourself. Thank you for listening. x

Actions do not accumulate effort through change. Change is only truly determined through the spontaneity and emotional reaction to communicate. Physical action has time to bide and counter or agree with the opposition's or affiliates defense. Change or maintenance of opinion physically is abundant with the advantages of time and adverse thought. Selfish instinct is a modern survival technique that governs people today more than the valuable instinct to nourish ourselves to adequately survive. Spontaneous communication incites and induces pain. Pain is momentary but fear of failure is eternal

I‚Äôm a 38 yr old female with a history of low self esteem due to battling severe social phobia and agoraphobia and sexual mental abuse in my teens and 20s. 
I‚Äôve had a lot of challenges over the years that has made huge gaps in my past where milestones should have been. My teens and 20s were emotionally and physically rough coping with mental illness that I didn‚Äôt get to grow like my peers did. Ive always been a decade or even more behind.
Ive learnt that being busy meant I didn‚Äôt think about these things. At 34 I got my first job. Severe social phobia prevented that in my past. But everything changed for the better when that happened. I gained my best self and self taught myself the importance of self identity and self care and communication. I also learnt there were many people in similar or different boats to me - that I was okay and didn‚Äôt need to be so hard on myself. They were big lessons going from excluding myself from society to being social in a work environment and actually letting people get to know me.
I even got a boyfriend out of it.
But that was 5 years ago and since then everything went downhill again. I lost my job 2 years ago as they had to downturn. My partner has severe schizophrenia and so many problems with him that it has been very hard for me to cope. Over the last 4 years I went from my best to my worst with adrenal fatigue from this relationship. It‚Äôs not abusive it‚Äôs just having to cope with his delusions and ups/downs, drug issues, money issues not being able to plan issues, hygiene issues, depression , psychosis and issues not being able to realise these issues and their toll on others. 
Hes been a big love hate in my mind. Basically I‚Äôm his best friend really. But due to coved 19, he sleeps day and night now. It‚Äôs hard to get much interaction, but I do go for walks with him that really help.But unless someone is there to encourage him to do anything but sleep, he‚Äôll just sleep or clean his room, not really anything else. He has issues with concentration even a movie or tv show.
He is my 1 contact really. The last year I‚Äôd been volunteering and that helped my social phobia and depression at bay but now since coved 19 and relying more on him to talk to it‚Äôs been hard. His depression can wear onto me. 
At the same time I‚Äôm having grief thinking about my baby body clock and the dream of finding a man and having a child and think I‚Äôm too late. My cousin is expecting and it‚Äôs quite painful for me. I want to build my life again.

Hello/ good afternoon, I don't know if I'm just paranoid or that its normal to feel like that and Im confused. Its my first time using antidepressants that i was prescribed to on Friday because he says I might have mild depression. My psychiatrist says to start me off with a very low dosage and this is my 4th day of taking it but I read that effects will start within a few weeks. Nothing happened until last night when I was having a headache and my stomach suddenly felt so tense but I had nothing to be nervous for at that time but I couldn't calm down at all, overtime it subsided bit out of sudden it will just come back again. And again, it might have been paranoia but I don't know if I'm just overthinking things. I'm just really worried that no one will believe me for repeating the same thing if I keep saying that I feel too anxious to do easy tasks or I can't explain why I can't do anything.

Hey everyone,
I hope you are all doing well.
I want to make this thread to share how my experience with depression, and hopefully learn from other people's experiences too.
I have very poor processing speed and working memory (bottom 15th percentile, bottom 40th percentile, respectively) . It takes significantly more time for me to figure things out and memorise things than other people. This has always affected my social life in school, and even now; a lot of the time back then, I was percieved as the 'disabled kid'. I literally made no friends, I had only a few acquaintances. Eventually though, I started to care less about what other people think of myself, and started to care more about self-improvement. The problem is, my cognative limitation is also affecting my ability to learn new skills, furthermore, me being able to work towards self-improvement. I always get mental burnouts, which stop me from learning, even when I want to keep pushing. I know this sound stupid, but I think it's a suitable analogy- I feel like my ability and rate of learning is proportional to how much time and how well an oven that is broken, can cook, that can only be turned on after 3 hours of resting, only to be used for 10 minutes.
I live in time and place where I have endless 'opportunities for success' but I can't even reach any of them. It's frustrating, especially when you're in an environment where everyone else is normal and successful; even within my family memers, i'm the bad leftovers of the gene pool.
All in all, i'm at the point in my life where I don't even care about my status, and/or other people. I don't believe it's too much to ask for, that I simply want to learn a new skill for myself, to be good atleast something (yes, i'm literally good at nothing. and I'd rather not argue that).
What I'm trying to seek out - I would like to know the experiences of other's with poor cognative proficiencies. How were you able to learn a skill, or anything for that matter?
I hope I haven't missed anything. I want to thank you all for reading till this point.

Hey everyone,

I'm not even sure that what i'm experiencing is actually depression. The thought that i might have depression pops up every now and then and has been for years. My wife has also flagged it a few times with me. The problem is that i don't neccesarily feel ""depressed"". I'm still able to get up and go about my day. I go to work, i exercise regularly, look after my kids  contribute at home.
The specific areas where i struggle are a general lack of interest in most things. I've always had very few interests apart from reading or watching content for example.
The other area i really struggle in, and is of biggest concern for me, is when it comes to my 3 boys. The best way i can put it is that i love them all very much, but i can't stand being a parent (the day to day responsibilites). It also amazes me how quickly i can feel angry towards them or over react for trivial things their doing. The mess they make is a real struggle for me even though i know it's just a part of the process of kids playing.This has only been made harder by the current situation with Corona virus and the need to keep them at home, but it's certainly brought my struggles into focus. I feel mostly irritable towards them on most days and the main feeling i have regarding my boys is that i would rather not be around them. I know that sounds terrible but it's just what i have noticed how i feel.
I have also observed within myself a pretty negative headspace.

The question i have is whether or not this is depression?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks

so pretty much i'm diagnosed with general anxiety and social anxiety but i don't think i was with depression. although my mum and dad have mentioned a few times the fact that i have it, and so has my psychologist, and i guess i do have i suppose the ""symptoms"" of it but i was never diagnosed with it so do i just assume it? or ask my psychologist about it? bc like i knew i had severe anxiety years before i was hospitalised and diagnosed with it. so i don't really know what to do

I'm new here. I feel like I am having a post natal depression. I have a 2 months  old baby. Feeling shit all the time. Tried to book an appointment to my GP but cancelled  it because i don't  really want to talk about my feelings may be somehow i am ashamed  about how i feel. Feeling  shit for  no reason. Sometimes i feel like I  just want to give up for no reason again. I don't  know. Just feeling alone and lonely and need this thing out from my chest..

I woke up this morning and didn‚Äôt want to get up. I spent the whole day sleeping and starring at the wall wasting the day away. I feel this intense feeling of pain constantly that consumes me and I feel like I can‚Äôt move. I told myself it was going to get up but I just didn‚Äôt, I dont know why. 
I have so many goals but am failing in all of them it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt have them it‚Äôs that they just seem unattainable (school success etc) I‚Äôm so behind in school I want to do so extremely well but I don‚Äôt have the energy or motivation to get stuff done. I hate how I haven‚Äôt left my bed all day yet I feel like it‚Äôs the only place I can be. I want to be left alone and no one to come, but at the same time I want people here with me to show that they care as much as I know they do because I don‚Äôt want to feel like this anymore. I don‚Äôt want to spend days lying in bed feeling like I‚Äôm not actually living. I tried getting in contact with a psychologist finally after getting a referral from my GP but she hasn‚Äôt responded, my GP, did a call as I couldn‚Äôt see her in person and it wasn‚Äôt a help at all which was a waste of money for my parents to pay for a 5min call of her telling me to take more breaks during school days at home and the fact I didn‚Äôt actually get anything to help. My parents don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôm feeling, all I told them was I was unwell because really I didn‚Äôt know what to say and as much as they try to help they don‚Äôt. I just don‚Äôt know what to do at this point because I feel like it‚Äôs getting worse. It‚Äôs almost like I have to remind them I have depression and I don‚Äôt even like to say it. My friends are the best people ever but I have the fact I‚Äôm sad all the time now and that I have to tell them that I‚Äôm struggling because I feel like there is no one else to tell.

I‚Äôm not quite sure what to do. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs depression but lately he‚Äôs been silent for whole days and when he does say something it‚Äôs very limited. I asked him if he was okay if it‚Äôs to maybe do with stress from university or whatnot. I asked him and he told me that he doesn‚Äôt think he is okay... I‚Äôm not sure how to support him :( I have no experience with having or dealing with mental health disorders but i want to help my boyfriend out but i don‚Äôt know what I should do

So a bit over a month ago I moved down to my inlaws farm to escape the city as the virus ramped up. As much as anything to get out incase SHTF and so the kids had space instead of being cooped up in a suburban block for what was looking at the time like being months and months.
Anyway, down here now, working from home in a tent (because the study is a walk in robe) - no issue there as i have been wfh for years, and the tent isnt a worry at all, im still pretty well set up.
Overall i am completely sick and tired of the overarching family crap. Tried talking to my wife, but she will only talk to me when her mum is around anyway, and to be honest, i am sick to death of her mum. Between the endless reality TV shows, whatever the trending disaster is on facebook and the critisim of everything else.
No one can ever have a different opinion than what is on facebook or ScoMo has said on the day. Letter of the law for everyone, yet their son and his wife come around constantly (she is a cop who was on the virus quarantine checking team), had a butcher and his mate here for 3 days, both go to other jobs in town - yet its my kids who will catch and spread the germs or if i go to the supermarket.
My wife has asked me several times what is wrong, but i have given up answering - because it just becomes im the one at fault. To be fair i just want to go home. I know this is almost over, but its really pushing me towards a bad winter of sadness, and i am sitting here wondering if i should just get a divorce. I just dont want to hurt my kids.
To top things off a good friend committed suicide the other week.¬†
Yeah - so things are awesome.

Well I‚Äôve kind of not been so great at the self love thing so I‚Äôm back. I thought I was coping but I now know I wasn‚Äôt as still not doing so well with covid 19 still being in the news constantly, some family issues going on, on a prescription tablet to help me sleep at night and got a an appointment with my skin specialist on the 27th of this month as I‚Äôve got the type of moles most likely to become melanomas (have already had 2 stage one melanomas removed & one heading to stage one as well that was also removed). Not to mention I‚Äôve gone from no bad thoughts/no nightmares with basically not a good way of finishing/not sleeping(well last night at least)/no worrying/no overthinking things to having those being back again. I‚Äôve also not been completely honest with my gp as to how I‚Äôm really feeling ect ect ect during the phone appointments with her which I know is not the best thing and also I really think I need to have a appointment with a psychologist.

Hello, my mom and I fight a lot and lately they have been getting worse and worse. One of them is where she said that I'm the reason for her and my entire family to have sleepless nights and that it's my fault for making my parents argue. She said that everytime I was mentioned, my dad would want to end the conversation leading to another fight making they're relationship worse. She has also said that I am the most problematic child and the biggest disappointment in her life. She said she was lucky that she has 2 perfect children and says it's my fault for making her life so terrible and stressful. I don't know what to say, only that I'm really sad.

Hi, I will keep this brief (as much as I can)
I first went to my doctor for a different issue I ended up coming out with. I found out I was extremely stressed and anxious, honestly hadn't thought about it but I was constantly worrying, over thinking, angry and defensive. However I loved life most days. It has been some time since then and I am now seeing a psychologist. 
Things have gone down hill very fast and i'm not sure why as I believe the opposite is meant to happen. I have only seen them a couple times, once a fortnight, however when I leave I feel 100 times worse, as I reopen bad memories etc. It takes me about a week to feel anything good again. 
I am falling to pieces as I fail uni, cant see my friends and wake up instantly thinking about everything terrible in mind that I cant seem to escape. I keep trying to better myself but by the end of the day I physically and mentally cant do anymore. I don't see a future for my self, which upsets me a lot. 
I will mention that I have had pretty bad depression and anxiety before however this feels a lot different. The psychologist did say I might have ADD or some sort of learning disability which just makes me even more stressed as I try to study and now overthink things even further like if I am getting distracted or if i can read, must say I have found I get very distracted and it takes a lot of effort to sit down and read. I constantly think whats the point which leads me down a dark hole.
This probably sounds very weird but I feel like I don't want to be inside my body but be free, like a bird. I am not sure if I have a question to be answered but anything to clear my mind up would be amazing.
Thanks

I am over living in isolation. Over working from home. Being a single mum. Having my job go from full time to part time. I miss my friends. I miss my family. I have such anxiety and so depressed how do we get through this 
",Depression
"
Hilarious. Puntastic even. Energetic and fun to be round. Moving
and dancing in the living room for as long as was needed just to get a rise out
of someone.

Back then, I didn‚Äôt realise how happy I was. I‚Äôm different
now though and I wish I could go back. Hindsight is a real bitch. That
comparison just gets to me, ‚Äòhow the hell did I go from that to this?‚Äô, I ask. I
am way better than I have been in the last four years and even so, I am a
fraction of the person I once was. Is this as good as it gets for me now or am
I taking the first steps on the road leading to my old self, the real me? Maybe
that was the fake me before and this is the real me now?
Describing the difference between then and now is difficult.
I can do all the things I once did, it‚Äôs just ‚Ä¶ empty, fake, viewed from
elsewhere; meaningless actions, moods and behaviours. Now anything I do is not
done for its own pleasure but rather to distract from my own thoughts.
What if the worst is yet to come?

My mother sang Mozart's Cradle Song to me when I was small.
'Sleep now, my little boy, oh sleep.
Slowly the grey shadows creep...'
Even though it was written somewhere around 1700-1800', and it's always been quite ageless, and very soothing to me. To countless others as well I imagine.
Although I have a mind-blowing collection of co-morbid afflictions, my main 'problem child', the one that makes my body chemistry almost impossible to treat due to instability, is bipolar (type ii, super rapid cycler). I can cycle every couple of days, to 5 times a day, to once a month, and so forth, no pattern or apparent reason. Most often it's on the extreme rapid side though, a couple of times a day.
It's probably redundant to say on here that it changes your whole....everything. Body chemistry, mood, desires, goals, mental state etc . And it's almost never the same twice. People weren't designed for that, and like anything, if you bend something back and forth enough, eventually it breaks.
And I used to be optimistic. Even though the first two things drilled into me, oh so long ago, were 'You won't ever be ""cured"", don't live in hope of that', and 'You can't ever be how you were before. Your life can't. So accept your new dynamic and move on as best you can'.
And there have been some bad times, some really bad times. But there have also been...some almost not as bad times. I'm not sure I can make claim to good times. But I always stayed...if not optimistic, at least...( Apart from a few times...you know how it goes), at least_mostly_ steadfast.
I found lights somehow, and sometimes I learned to make my own, usually for others, and mostly, the darkness kept it's distance.
But now...
Now.. Mozart's Cradle Song is less comforting.
Because he's right , in a sinister way.
I've seen them...I _feel_ them.
It's getting harder to find the lights, and in my head Mozart's line becomes a haunting prophecy that rings over and over...
""Slowly the grey shadows creep.""

Hi everyone, 
I have recently joined this forum in the hope that I can connect with people who may be going through similar experiences to me. I have a family history of depression/anxiety and it is something that I have dealt with on and off throughout my life. Depression and anxiety tend to come out in my body through stomach aches, head aches and insomnia, which causes a really tough cycle to break. Recently, I have been very unwell with unexplained headaches that were thought to be a sinus infection, but after about 5 weeks of strong antibiotics in total, nothing seems to be working. This has been really hard to deal with and has greatly impacted by life, putting me in a terrible head space that has caused me to go back on anti depressants. I try really hard by exercising every day, eating well, forcing myself to get out of bed despite the headaches, writing in my journal and talking to my therapist. Despite all my efforts, nothing seems to be working or making much of an impact on how I feel. Even though I know this won't last forever, I can't help but catastrophize the situation and can't see a way out. If anyone has any techniques/thinking strategies for getting through when times are tough or has a similar story, I would really appreciate it.

Hi All,
Sorry if I stuff this up.
I recently got diagnosed with a scary condition that I am simply not coping with. I do not understand how I went so long without it being found out. I guess as has been explained to me, a true diagnosis is not achieved until it escalates. Currently I am still awaiting a full diagnosis as I was told it can be a long process.
I have a wonderful partner who is supportive and pushed me to get help after a bad lot of episodes, but he doesn't fully understand and sometimes simply has no idea how to be supportive. 
I really just wish someone understood. I feel quite alone trying to deal with this, despite the support of my partner. I am scared by the diagnosis and what is occuring.
 
Sorry All, but thanks.

Shit went down recently for me (lost someone. No one died). I was distraught for a couple of days. Crying a lot. Absolutely shattered.

And then I started feeling emotionless even though I know I would and should be feeling emotions.
I feel dazed and trance like. Like a haze. I stare at things but I'm not zoning out or actually staring. I don't feel anything. I don't feel love, despair, hope, sadness, no empathy. Sometimes I get closer to feeling things but I just can't. I'm edging on feeling emotions.
When I do my evening walks, it's extra weird because I just walk like a zombie staring up ahead but not at anything and I just mindlessly walk. Completely emotionless.

I've had experienced this a lot before. I'm only just talking about it know because me feeling nothing right now is really weird. I just want to feel something. And I want to care. But I can't make myself feel anything or care. (btw I don't self harm, never have.)
The only thing that showed I still felt anything was my back pain and shoulder pain which is caused by things like anxiety or stress. But that's also gone.
I used to be scared I was a psychopath or something because I never felt anything at all. No empathy, no care ect.

I told a friend about this and they said that it sounded like disassociation but honestly I have no clue. But It could also be depression? Is it grief? I don't know. I just want to feel something so badly.
I also worry that it means I don't care about what happened or the person I've lost.

Hi imma just come all out here since it's all confidential, I'm 21 just been through the run of my life..
The end of February I got told I was gonna be a dad & i didn't take it well at all, I said some shit that I shouldn't of said & my gf broke up with me, we then we're going through the idea of being single parents that I didn't want, I kinda felt like I got used for sex & other stuff..
We kinda talked on and off after the break up, I was at work a few weeks ago & got a text saying she had a miscarriage, I didn't even find out much about what's happened & it kind of destroyed me as i ended up coming to terms with having a kid & then everything got taken away, we are still split up & I've been trying to battle this on my own.. 

Sorry if some parts don't make sense, any help would be greatly appreciated!

I had a really hard time last year. I moved to Australia to study and struggled a lot. There were days when I was so lifeless and didn't want to get out of bed. I had trouble falling asleep but once I did, I didn't used to wake up long hours. I used to sleep till 18 hours. I didn't think there was a point to keep going. I also had moments where I was feeling so good that I felt everything was fine. I was crazy energised and I used to sleep really really less and didn't feel tired. I also spend a lot of money (a lot) and regretted that so much. I didn't think too much. I just thought I was feeling this way because of moving away. Anyways I went home and everything was super normal. The problem is that when I came back go Australia after a few months, this started happening again. The only difference is that now I am living with my friends. They said that I seem really strange and I should see someone as I might have the bipolar disorder after I told what had happened last year. I got really scared when I heard that. I looked up a lot of articles online and saw that usually when someone has the bipolar disorder the mania symptoms last usually for a few days. When I tried to think about mine, I couldn't remember anything clearly from last year. I have no idea about how long the highs lasted. The highs were super less compared to the lows. I only had one high episode after coming back (it's been a few weeks) where I was super happy but it only lasted a few hours. Could this be bipolar disorder? I want to add that the depressed time always lasts for at least a few days if not weeks.

What do people do when it all becomes too much and outlets are not working or you can't do them?
BP2 and being stuck at home and losing all my previous outlets to help manage my depression has me losing my mind. 
I can't go to gym and can't easily go outdoors and exercise cause i have 4 young kids. If I can manage it it only temporarily helps. I can't go see friends and try talk to them frequently but it's not the same. I can't do anything for my self care as everything is closed. 
I was managing well before now with routines and things to do and it's really affecting me.
I'm feeling so worthless and have no motivation for anything and just cry randomly all the time with thoughts of self harm creeping back in.
I'm also becoming so anxious and paranoid and jumpy and just can't shake the 'funk'.
I've chatted to lifeline and it helped voicing how trapped I'm feeling but again it only helped temporarily. 
Visited the GP to touch base and he's added a medication to try of a night. 

But I need ideas or sources/resources of what I can do during the day to get passed this because i can feel the mini crisis slowly unravelling more

Hi
I am 29 yo student in Australia. I've been feeling horrible lately and I don't know what to do. 
I lost my job, I have a couple of months worth of savings to pay rent and food, and then I don't know what will happen. I can't go back to my home country. Logistically, I can't, there are no flights and all possible countries to do layover along the way have close their borders. But I also can't because there is nothing to go back to. I have fought for the last 4years to build a life here, Australia was my bet for a future without fear and after 4 years I was finally feeling save, hopeful even. I had friends, a goddaughter that I adore, a life that I was happy living. And in 1 month it crumbled. 
I'm waking up every day crying, and I have trouble getting anything done during the day. I'm terrified. Every time I try to think of something else the thought of going back pops into my head and I start panicking. I can't concentrate on reading or even watching TV. All I can think is what am I going to do? how do I pay the bills? what if I have to go back? 
I feel less than human. Like all it matters about me is the paper that says I don't belong here. It feels like the world is saying that my life doesn't matter as much, that I am not a life worth saving, that if I go back and died it's not important. And I'm having a really tough time trying to convince myself that that's not true. That I am not a waste of space.

Hi everyone, 
I'm 24 years old and I was just wondering if anyone had ever felt the same way as me...
Every since I was little, I was always an introverted person even up to high school. I did have a lot of people who wanted to be my friend, but it was weird because I was always quite content on my own.
In highschool I did have quite a few friends, but they weren't very nice people at all, and I did cut a lot of them off later on. It was only until year 11-12 that I started talking a lot more, connecting more with people, going to parties etc..
It wasn't until after school that I started making a lot more friends, and it had felt like I had become almost facebook famous at one stage, but when I was 19 was when I started to get really bad depression, and started to fall in and out of it.
I ended up making two really good friends who ended up betraying me later, and I know most people would say your still young etc, but because I have been either been used a lot and taken advantage a lot, been friends with narcasstic people who either put me down, it almost feels like I'm not bothered anymore.
I deleted my Facebook about 3 years ago, because I felt like no one would bothered with me, comparing myself to other people, negative energy etc.. 
A few people have often told me that I'm either too nice, which I knew that for a while, so cutting people off who I knew weren't treating me good almost became easy, and I had always felt like my kindness had been taken for granted or abused.
Even before then, I started feeling more isolated then ever, almost always falling back into loneliness or isolation. I have two aquaintences/friends who I am grateful for, who I talk to from time to time, but I just feel withdrawn and I don't connect with them.
And I almost feel like it's my fault or guilty, because I never really bothered that much in my younger years. I know I'm still young but I almost feel like I can't make effort anymore, like my emotions are almost numb because I have been in pain for a lot of my life.
It's just whenever I seem to extrovert myself, it seems to backfire later on. I'm trying to love myself for who I am, even I have gotten involved with men who have either ended up saying the right things/ghosting me, so I naturally have a lot of trust issues.
I Was just wondering is it okay to not have any friends at this age, and still try to live your life to the fullest? Was wondering if anyone else felt the same way at all? I feel always alone within myself.

Hi all. 
I‚Äôve been in and out of depression for 23yrs. On and off meds in and out of Drs. The last 10yrs I have had a handle on the depression being able to pull myself out without meds. I‚Äôve had anxiety for 4yrs now and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs getting to me the most and making my depression worse. 
today was the day, I went to see my gp and had a full mental breakdown, I‚Äôve never broken like that before, I‚Äôve been prescribed meds again. 
I dont know if I‚Äôm here for advice, to talk, or just put my thoughts out into the void where I won‚Äôt be judged or told to ‚Äúget over it‚Äù. 
im in the darkest place I have ever been, and with the heartache and trauma of my life since I was young that (to me) says so much and scares the living hell out of me.

Hi 
I am a 34 teacher who is currently feeling very lonely. This loneliness started before COVID when I was a teenager whose friends kept moving on. Being part of a youth group felt like a cover where it's like I had many friends but in reality I had none. Being told that it is a natural part of life doesn't help as I feel its my fault. Now at 34 I struggle to keep the friends feeling that they will also move on. At the moment it's hard to get up. I find myself interacting with less people (even before COVID) I don't see the joy in the things that I used to love and it's hard to see the good the things I am currently doing. 
I've never had a boyfriend and the hope of being loved like that dwindles each day. I feel like I am surrounded by women (in my job and in life) and have no interactions with men except those in my family. I hate it when people comment 'when are you getting married?' because I have tried to interact with men in the past but they have never seen me that way. I am afraid that I will be alone in life, surrounded by family BUT still alone. 
My current job is stressful having taken a job that I thought would be fulfilling but is not.I feel like I have been pressured by my family to get a full time job as it is the normal thing to do. BUT felt like I left a perfectly good part time job that I loved to get this normal job which I (atm) hate. I feel like a fraud I have studied 2 degrees of education BUT I have not found this field fulfilling. 
At the moment I am living at home with parents, they still think of me as a child. I know it is coming from a place of love BUT I find if suffocating and at times frustrating. My dad also suffers from anxiety and depression which sometimes is difficult to deal with. Sometimes I just feel like living in my room and not coming out because I don't want to deal with them. My brother will be moving out soon I am worried that I will be getting more depressed when its just my parents and I. I am worried that I will get more of the focus since I will be the only 'child' living there. I wish they would give me a little more freedom. I want to move away from home but that last time they did that they made me feel guilty about leaving them and not taking care of them. 
Spend most of my time online or just in my room. It's the only place I feel at home. Feel like life is passing me by, that I am not living it but just staring at it afraid to move. 
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

ive been having a pretty rough time. I don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on. My mind is always thinking about stuff. I‚Äôve had a history of bad relationships. I feel like I am a good person. I am always doing what I can for everyone. But now I feel like no one has ever really had my back. People have always taken me for granted. I feel like my generation sucks to be a nice guy. I just feel worthless a lot even though I try my best. I feel down. I can‚Äôt sleep. I‚Äôm often crying. 
I kind of miss my ex girlfriend. Even though she treated me wrong and was toxic and manipulative . It felt like someone cared a bit. my cat passed away last year. I miss her a lot. 
i just feel like I have no one. Voices in my head just keep asking me if anyone cares or if anyone notices kind of thing. I just wish someone out there could understand.

Honest truth required. Who in their right mind can offer me some advice, I don't know who can help me. I have been living in a foreign country for the past 5 years. I have completed my 3 year studies from the local university while working part time and only getting the tuition fees paid. Upon completion of studies, I got my first job in my field of study but after the probation period, I was made redundant. Depression hit me when I was back to working midnight to dawn shifts at the local service station. I kept applying for work but nobody accepted me. I then worked in a restaurant as a bartender, and left that job because the management was being horrible and I would only find solace in drinking and that was a problem. I was not finding any other work and then my lease ended. I found a place that would accept cash and rented it out but due to the pandemic, I lost my job at the cafe and I am being evicted because I do not have the money to pay for rent nor do I have a place to go. That is because my visa expires today and I have no clue what to do? Should I stay here and study a degree that is going to be beneficial in the long run or go back to a country where I have spent less time than here. if anybody tells you cultural norm is bs then they are wrong. I had no idea how to behave with my own parents because they did not see certain things in my way. OH and did I tell you that I just realised I have concentration problems, horrible addiction, loss of focus (ADHD). WHAT DO I DO? I FEEL HELPLESS. 
To anyone reading this here and feeling helpless, I GENUINELY SYMPATHISE WITH YOU. YOU ARE NOT ALONE. Sorry, to many capital letters can be daunting. if you're a fan of B99 then you might've read it as Capt. Holt's voice. Thats funny. Anyways, look. I don't know who can help me, but im certain that there are others who have a more genuine concern. Look after one another and stay safe. Peace and love.

HI everyone,
I am not sure if I can get any help from this forum but I am just trying my best to recover. I have this bouts of crying without a reason and I am irritable most of the time. I get agitated with people around me very fast and I know it is not their mistake. I feel I am not liked by anyone and no one wants me anymore. eve a joke or a humor from my partner feels like a nasty comment and I get offended easily. I feel if I am not there people around me would be happier and probably better off. I feel like I am a burden on everyone and no one needs me any more. I had typed this message on another thread and could not get ny response. Probably was wrong on the group. I also sometimes am verbally abused by people around me. Feel I don't have much independence in my life.

regards,

Hi, for years I dealt with the sadness and feelings of worthlessness as just that, I was weak and just get over it. It wasn't until 2015 or a bit before when I was formally diagnosed as ""Depressed"" (Im turning 40 this year). From there it has been a trial of medications until we thought we got it right. That is until now when my recent visit to Psychiatrist had him revisiting his theory to question ""Mania"". Long story short I hadn't been able to see this psychiatrist again till now, so more than 3 years later. First step now is to wean off the medication now that he believes has been basically a toxin to me and making me and my condition worse. I see him again next week for the next step, but basically now we need to delve into a new diagnosis of possible Bipolar. I honestly just feel so weird about it. Excited that I might be able to fix myself ""again"" but so nervous at such a confronting ""disease/illness"". How did you deal with a new diagnosis?

Hi all, 
ive sat starring at this new thread screen for nearly 3 hours tossing between im just being silly and that always present feeling of it doesn't matter. 
I was diagnosed with extremely severe depression and anxiety almost 12 months ago and have been given multiple medications. 
2020 was supposed to be a happy year for me. I was marrying the love of my life. Thats where the good vibes stop. Half of my family didn't come and two days later my nan passed away. trying to talk to those around me was stressful as I felt that they didn't understand why I was feeling the way I did ""it couldn't be helped"" was on repeat from everyones mouth.
since then my mental health has only gotten worse, there were things I was looking forward to like going on a well needed holiday for 10 days with no phone reception or people around me. Now I am surrounded by people who become over bearing in the sense that every move I make is questioned and watched. 
Im scared of myself right now. im scared that I will always invalidate myself. 
My mood swings are all over the place and I don't know how to live with myself. 
I thank each and everyone of you for your own strength

I've been struggling for these past few months now with feelings I'm not sure how to describe. I have plenty of good days i think, but i know that deep down-- I'm really not happy. It feels like I have all this pent up sadness and frustration but I can't fully feel it. I feel a little empty I suppose. Or like I've been hurting for so long, that now it's just faded into the background and just lingers constantly in the back of my mind. But I would go to school, get busy with school work and volleyball so it wasn't that bad I suppose. But with this virus I'm suddenly left alone with my thoughts. Now I'm struggling to see anything to look forward to anymore. School work is beginning to pile, and I'm too nervous to look at it and I constantly feel like I'm not good enough because I'm avoiding the work, while my friend is acing every assignment. Even now as I'm writing this I feel the pressure of not studying.
My friends and I have made a list of things to do when we're allowed to do so, but it's just hard to fully feel excited about them because of what I'm going through. I'm just so tired.
I've never been one to tell friends how I'm feeling especially because I can barely comprehend these feelings myself. I can't talk to my parents about it. I don't really know what to do. I just want to cry and lay down-- but I haven't even be able to do that really either.
I've never felt this exhausted and nervous and empty before. And I don't know what to do, because these thoughts are so new I'm scared. I just want it to stop. Does anyone know what these thoughts could mean? Am I being unreasonable? Is there anything I can do, myself, to get better?

I have struggled with anxiety for many years and thought that was the worst feeling in the world. 
but this, what I believe is depression is completely unknown and it‚Äôs hard to explain how I‚Äôm feeling.
perhaps numb? I feel a lot of guilt too. I‚Äôm not me anymore. 
im especially finding work difficult. I work with children and I used to be a good worker! But I am struggling to connect with the children at this point in my depression and this makes me feel so guilty. The children I work with deserve a much better version of me that I am struggling to give right now but I can‚Äôt afford to just give up my job either. 
my patience is minimal, all I do is eat my feelings constantly (gained 30kg in the past 12 months) which further harms my mental health and I just don‚Äôt know how to snap out of this.
i refuse to take medication, I just can‚Äôt! I‚Äôm sure it helps some people, but my mum has had a rough journey with antidepressants and I can‚Äôt go down that road. I‚Äôve just started taking something natural to help with stress so let‚Äôs see how that goes.
i know this was caused by alot of stress. An emotionally abusive relationship breakdown, raising a child alone and not being able to connect with anyone at all really. My support system is low.

Hi all,

I am currently a student of age where parents are relevant. My issue may be trivial however, I am currently struggling to talk to my parents regarding mental health. I have already prompted the issue indirectly and my parents do believe I have mental health issues. They are also willing to provide me support. However, despite their openness and acceptance, I am having trouble discussing the results of an online test to them. I am worried for no logical reason and do really want to tell them. However, I am not able to work up the courage. By the way, the online test (by Blackdog institute) gave results which showed severe depression and severe anxiety. Please provide any advice you find relevant.

Hi all,
I don't really know why I'm writing this, maybe just to get some insight on the matter and see if anyone feels similar and has some advice. 
I really dislike (I don't like using to word hate, because then I feel like I'll never recover because its so severe) myself, and feel like I have little self-worth and value. But this isn't the issue. 
The issue is that sometimes I become so apathetic when I get in an episode, that I feel like nothing I say or do has worth or purpose, and therefore no one is going to care. I'm scared that one day I will say or do something and hurt someones feelings, but not realise it because I thought what I said had no worth, therefore no one took notice. 
I try to be a kind and loving person, so hurting peoples feelings really isn't my nature, but I'm scared one day it will be and I'll have no idea.
Anyway, sorry this was kind of a ramble.
Thanks.

Hi,
Mother of 3. Months ago I had an experiencing which helped me get off my antidepressants and I felt amazing I was on the right path, I wasn't angry all of the time, I didn't snap over little things with the kids, I learnt how to shift negative and impulsive thoughts and in general I really just felt like a new person! 

Until a couple of months ago when I started to lose myself again. Ever since then I've felt myself slowly slip back into a dark hole and I can't seem to find the light to make my way back out! I'm back to being that not so fun grumpy mum and wife! I hate it... I tell myself I will wake up in a better mood tomorrow, things will change, I'll do it different. It never happens. It always goes the same way like a vicious cycle. My husband doesn't understand and I don't expect him to. He lost his happy, fun, outgoing wife and now has me. The complete opposite. I was never this person, I'm not this person. Currently trying to find ways to think better, pause and stop before I speak... Even typing this right now is so easy and some people would say, well just do it! It's really not that simple, if it was would we all be here reading these forums and adding to them? No. We wouldn't. Our mental illnesses do not define who we are. Remember that...

I am a walking contradiction. 46, single mum strong but weak. I am legally blind and this has made me strong but very weak. I‚Äôm strong in the sense I can alley take care of my son and can do most things myself. Weak in the sense when I get a male I my life I change myself to be who he likes then chases him relentlessly when he leaves. My last relationship of 6 years I pushed him away so often eventually throwing him out because I was so angry at myself for what I‚Äôd become then after he moved out I find myself chasing him wanting him back. I know I‚Äôm really pathetic and I don‚Äôt really want him back but I‚Äôm scared of being alone because of my disability. I have depression and anxiety, I used to self harm but I have been strong enough to stop that. I hate myself every day for being weak with men and chasing relentlessly. I just wish I had more respect for myself but with the anxiety and depression I crave to be looked after. My family has abandoned me. Long time ago with both parents passing and my sisters hating me as I was the youngest and they saw me as spoiled. The only real love I hav in life is my son.

Are you sensitive? If so you might be in the range of a HSP. Studies show up to 15-30% of people could fall into this category. And I thought I was alone!
Have you had the comments
‚Äùyou should toughen up‚Äù
‚Äùdon‚Äôt be so sensitive‚Äù
Yet these people don‚Äôt realise that your sensitivity is part of you, your personality. It‚Äôs like you suggesting they grow shorter as ‚Äúyou are too tall‚Äù How absurd.
Sensitive people have strong inner feelings, can be creative in things like writing, like to help other people or animals and generally care deeply in their convictions.
So people that criticise us are in effect bullying us to be someone we are not. If possible stand up for yourself because sure as yabbies bite your toes, if you don‚Äôt then you‚Äôll be walked over.
We cant all be without sensitivity, we can‚Äôt all be low in emotion... not everyone is a highly sensitive person, if they were they‚Äôd understand how our world is full of inner feelings and also wonderful in a strange way because we ‚Äúfeel‚Äù and that my friend is priceless...

Hi everyone,

I have been living in Australia for several years and became a permanent resident about a year ago.

In the past I have been diagnosed with ADHD (primarily inattentive), generalized anxiety disorder and depression, however I have not been on medication or undergoing any form of treatment for the past few years. I have generally learned to manage them reasonably well (e.g. turn down the volume from 10 to 5). I have a good job and have generally done well; however, i do struggle from time to time. 

Over the past 6-8 months, I have felt myself really slipping backwards. I am really struggling to maintain focus on anything and I often feel drained of motivation. It's gotten to the point that it is affecting my life significantly - both personally and my ability to do my job well. This has further been compounded by my role at work evolving so that I am doing more of the kind of task that I find most challenging.  I feel tremendously unhappy, unmotivated and helpless. I have also frequently been feeling what I think is dissociation - I feel stuck inside of my head and like my brain and body aren't one and the same, or like I'm not actually part of the world around me. This is something that I haven't really felt on this level before.

And the COVID-19 situation isn't helping (anxiety, changed work environments/some time working at home), etc. I feel tremendous guilt that, despite being one of the lucky ones that still has a job, I'm struggling to keep motivated and actually do my job well. I'm also not sure if it's appropriate for me to seek help for my psychological difficulties at a time when there are bigger issues for health professionals, etc to deal with.

I'm frustrated to find myself in this position once again, and I don't want to end up falling into as dark of places as I have in the past. I know I need to seek help, but I really don't know how to go about it here in Australia.  I do not have an established safety net here in Australia like I did in my home country, and I don't know where to go to get the support I need. I don't even have a regular GP here. I am also a member of the LGBTQI+ community and I don't live in a large city where I feel there are significant queer-friendly resources available.

Any guidance on how I can move forward in this situation would be greatly appreciated, as I'm feeling at a bit of a loss at the moment.

I've been seriously depressed for a long time.
And by seriously, I mean my psychiatrist diagnosed me with MDD. That was over a decade ago, and from what they said, I've been depressed all my life.
My medications work pretty well, they keep a good veneer of coping on life. I'm still very negative, but I can work and keep on top of bills and legal stuff like that. My MDD is ""comorbid"" with other stuff, so that's kind of s%^.
Since getting sent home from work, I don't see anyone anymore. It's been two weeks now and its pretty difficult.
We're all working from home. It's still work, but without the human interaction.
I don't have any close friends around, and my family is all elsewhere. Phone calls are a rare thing, like unicorns rare.
Then my ex-partner of twenty years decided they wanted basically all the money in a divorce settlement. Happy Easter everyone.
Don't worry, I'm not suicidal, just sad

Hey everyone,
I'm 24, currently working & at uni (from home), living with my parents and younger brothers in Melbourne. I'm finishing my masters in environmental sustainability this semester which is an area I'm really passionate in, and work for a good non-profit (though I'm very bored of the work I'm doing, especially while working from home.)
I've been struggling with anxiety and intrusive depressive thoughts for the last few years. I notice a spike when the weather starts to turn (as it has in Melbourne the last week), when it gets cooler, less sunlight, more clouds etc. Don't want to label it as seasonal depression since I've never been diagnosed but yeah my symptoms match a lot of those symptoms -- just really flat mood, lack of energy, negative outlook, moody.
Little things really set off little depressive episodes and really intrusive thoughts. Like today my mum gave me a business sweater as an easter gift which is nice of her I guess but I've told her before that I don't need sweaters because I don't wear them for work or for anything so it's a waste, and I'd told my parents that when they wanted to buy me one when we were overseas in Canada over new year's (they still bought me one and it's been sitting in my closet ever since). But anyway my mum gave me the sweater and I told her again that I don't need one and it'll just go to waste, so it's better if they return it or give it to my brothers or something instead of it gathering dust in my closet. And just saying that has set off a little depressive episode, me feeling guilty about saying that, wishing I was more grateful, hating myself for maybe disappointing them etc. It's happened a lot lately w little things. 
I'm not sure how to cope with it the next few months. I saw a therapist a few times last spring for anxiety and she was kind of helpful but then I haven't been back to see her since about November and although there's tele-therapy or whatever, I don't feel comfortable having these discussions out loud in my family home with a therapist, and with lockdown there's nowhere else I can really go. Sport and gym really made me happy the last two years but now that's gone as well, I still do workouts at home which is good but still miss playing sport and the social aspect. I'm an introvert so don't mind time on my own though, solo walks have been good. 
Not sure what else to say or what I'm looking for -- solidarity, advice, questions, dunno. Just feeling flat and thought I should make a post.

im sorry if this is a bit too much..
She was Hit by a car that probably didnt even see her, and left on the side of the road. She was still alive when when i met her at the vet, driven by a passerby, and hung on long enough to recognise me, with a tail wag, as i carried her in to the O.R.
I stayed with her while she was in pain, laying there and holding her. She knew i was there, but i could see her slipping away. Her heart stopped just after my wife arrived. I cant believe she is gone.


As an anx/dep sufferer, i‚Äôm trying to keep strong and process the feelings in my own way, but my wife is taking it very hard.
we had her 11 years, and she was the most beautiful dog. We got her before we had kids of our own, so she was essentially child #1
Any advice for our grief, particularly how i Can help my wife?

Still till today I am emotionally sensitive, She past in her sleep unexpectedly with me cuddling her when I woke in the morning she was dead in my arms.

Because it was a unexpected death a police investigation was required and coronary report done, My wife was born with spina bifada and always had a difficult medical life and we were so close thru so many difficult times. I have very little motivation now always anxious, don't sleep much, I feel so empty inside that I have latch on to a old female freind for support only to be destroying that with overload her with texts doubting her support for me because of my own insecurity demanding constant reassurance of her friendship if I don't hear from her within hours, don't know how to stop this anxiety

I can‚Äôt get that time back...I‚Äôm also an essential worker and have had to work through most of the pandemic. I don‚Äôt feel like I have been able to grieve properly and now my mums birthday is approach on 26th October. I haven‚Äôt even been able to go  to her grave since she was buried on June 1st due to lockdown rules. I am getting really emotional again and feeling angry, frustrated and devastated. I‚Äôve lost my best friend in my mum and my next dearest in my mother in law. It‚Äôs been impossible to deal with. I‚Äôve lost mum. Hubby has lost both his parents.

I‚Äôm not sure if writing this will help but I‚Äôm not sure what else to do.
My husband passed away from a heart attack in July aged 41. He had no underlying health issues. I barely made it through Father‚Äôs Day & my birthday. Everyone keeps saying how strong I am but I feel like I can barely breath.
The world keeps turning & people are starting to get back into things but my world has stopped. We have a 6 year old who is low functioning Autistic who keeps pointing to pictures of Dad wondering where he is. I talk about him & try to explain as much as I can.
I feel like I‚Äôm letting our child & my husband down. People keep telling me they don‚Äôt know how to help & I just say that being there is all I need. But they don‚Äôt want to be there because that involves seeing me upset, which some can‚Äôt handle.
I feel responsible for his death because I couldn‚Äôt save him & I didn‚Äôt act fast enough.
I‚Äôve had some counselling where they talked about the stages of grief but I feel that wasn‚Äôt enough.
I couldn‚Äôt give my husband a proper send off because of the restrictions & looking back I feel his family who I don‚Äôt get along with took advantage of me but dictating what had to happen at the funeral & by taking some of his ashes. I tried to accomodate everyone but I feel I didn‚Äôt honour my husband enough. 
I don‚Äôt understand why this had to happen & how I‚Äôm supposed to keep putting one foot in front of the other.

Good morning all,
My loving partner died  3 weeks ago and I've been different each day....managing to do all the essentials but at times in a confused ""lost"" sort of way that I hide well.   I conduct conversations with others, some who know, some who don't very easily...chatting and laughing and carrying out the essentials of daily life, paying bills, making appointments, car services, new appliances etc....as if nothing had happened.  
Most mornings though I want to lie in bed for the whole day,never seeing or speaking to anyone.  Driving in the car when a piece of music plays that reminds me of ""us"" the tears come.   I attended a small group meeting of member of a club I belong to  (of course it's all been shut down and in limbo since Corona, so nothing happened to distract me from the loss)....just needed to see familiar faces.  Strangely enough conversation seemed to shut down and become a bit stilted when I arrived..no one mentioned my loss at all.    I was longing for a hug, so I could give way to my pent up emotions, but there were none. 
 No touch,no comfort offered....nothing!  Why was this?   These are great people and I know they care and like me..........but they didn't offer any words of comfort.   Perhaps I was wrong about them being my friends, perhaps they couldn't give a stuff about me after all...what an idiot I am!
The loss is not just""him""...a person.  It's the other things that have also gone.  No one knows me, ""gets""me, or thinks I am as beautiful as he did.   No one will tell me how lovely I look (even when I don't ) any more.  No one calls me  ""darling"". No one has my crazy at times black, sense of humour.   I don't know anyone else who laughs at the same things we did.  It's all those things that have gone too.  No one comes in the door and immediately enfolds me in a hug.
Why didn't my friends comfort me?

Hi Everyone. Two days ago was the birthday of someone I used to be married to. She died in 2006 when our kids were 9 and 11. At the time, she and i had been divorced for about 8 years and we had been sharing custody of our kids. I found out through a grandparent that, for the first time, my daughter went to the grave site. I am so pleased that she is acknowledging her grief. This post, though, is selfishly about me. The eldest of the two has not spoken to me in four years and the youngest, although living with me, puts a very clear wall between me and her grief. I have to tell you that I'm trans. I understand how that must complicate things but, there is no doubt in my mind about the love I have for my children and the depth of my desire to reach out and connect. That connection does not occur. I went down the street this morning to get a coffee and I saw a lovely mum playing with her toddler after probably dropping some of her other kids at school. The beautiful little kid was reaching out to their parent and it reminded me of how much things used to be like that with my kids. I am so sad. I don't know what to do with this sadness. Maybe it's mine forever.

Hi my name is Nicole. I am 35. I am a mother to 3 gorgeous sons. They are 9-8-3. I'm currently struggling with the loss of my dear mother. She was only 56 :(. My mum passed away 11-11-2019. Yet another emotional wave is crashing. Missing my mum so much. Feeling like I am only here because I have to be, not because I want to be. I'm feeling defeated. I'm feeling done.
I struggle to get out of bed. Because sleep is the only time I feel nothing. Wish I could just sleep the rest of my life away. Feeling like I am on auto polite. On the verge of tears. Constant pain in chest. Knowing a part of me is missing. I know we aren't meant to live forever. But I didn't expect my mum to be gone so soon. This is one of the worst pains. I just want my mum back :( 
I miss the old me. I have no motivation. Trying to work out how to survive the new normal. How do you live without the one who gave you life?... This pain is seriously like no other.

Hello, 
First time posting....
Whilst getting ready this morning, in general conversation, my daughter randomly dropped a bombshell that her teacher would be away today as they are going to a funeral of the father of a child in class...  I have since messaged the teacher to find out what the class know and or have been told.  I know the father, not well,  but somewhat, as their child is a very good friend of mine so have seen him at drop off / pick up, play dates, birthdays etc.  I am shocked as the child is similar age to mine, who is now experiencing this tragedy.  I tried talking to my daughter this morning about what she knew about the situation and her awareness of death but not sure of her actual understanding, hence why I messaged the teacher for some clarification...  Apologies for the confusing, long post...  My question is how do you talk to a primary school child who's good friend's dad has committed suicide and how to care for their friend?

i'm quite young, in anyone's terms. i had three older brothers, and an older sister as well. all of my brothers enlisted in the army, and were deployed when I was 10. i just remember my teacher telling me that there'd been an emergency and I had to go to my sister's school. we were taken to a quiet office and told that our two eldest brothers (who were twins) had died serving overseas. it sounds terrible, but I don't think I really felt it. i didn't really care until years later when I realised that I wasn't going to get them back, ever. just 2 years after that, our last brother died. he'd been shot, and died in intensive care later the same day. i felt his loss a lot more, and I don't know if it was because I was older, or if it was because I was closer with him than our other brothers. but I've had this sort of empty feeling in me whenever I see people with their siblings, or my friends talk about their brothers. I've never told anyone outside my family about it. it's too painful. once one of my friends told me I should get a brother, and I burst out crying at school. i keep getting flashbacks of all of us together, doing piggyback rides or stealing icecream or go kart rides. i just don't feel like anyone would understand. losing one sibling, maybe, but three? my sister has seemed to be fine, as bad as it sounds. she's never cried about it to my knowledge, and doesn't seem to be affected when anyone talks about their brothers or the army or war. i can barely hold in tears when that happens. we learnt about world war II in history and all I could think about was the hundreds of thousands of families who would never get their son or father or brother back. my four male cousins, who I am very close with, are all active members of different armies and I'm so terrified that I'm going to get a phone call one day telling me that they've passed away. I'm so scared I've begged them to quit the army but they don't seem to share the same fear. they were all devastated when my brothers died but they don't seem to ever consider that it could happen to them, and what it would do to our family. it's so painful writing this out, it just feels like there's a big hole in my chest that gets heavier every day. i miss them all endlessly.

I'm here home alone and my sister called to say Dad had collapsed in the city and the ambulance people were assisting him.
I phoned some friends and asked if they could come and be with me, they were busy.
My husband is on his way home, it will take him a couple of hours.
The police called into my sister's home and told her Dad has died.
I phoned my Minister and he said ""That will happen. People die."" I told him I had to go.
I don't know why I am sharing this here. I don't know what else to do right now.
I don't even know if this post is suitable for the forums.

Hi,
I lost my dad to suicide yesterday morning. My mum found him in our backyard. It was unexpected and i woke up to my mums call, her voice was distraught and she was yelling ""come home!"". Since yesterday, I've felt like I'm in limbo. I go through phases of having clear thoughts, (like listing out what needs to be done, making sure i look after myself so i can look after my mum, consciously acknowledging my own grieving process) and periods of just staring at nothing, with nothing and everything thoughts swimming in my head.
It's only been just over a day since its happened so I think I'm still in somewhat shock, I let myself cry when i need to, and i try to verbalise my thoughts and feelings with mum, and she does the same with me. I'm concerned for my mum as she is the one who found the body, had to call the ambos, and had to¬†perform cpr. I think she's still in shock too because when i ask her if she's having flashbacks or is that memory sort of haunting her, she says not really.
I feel odd, almost like i want to spiral into the emotional rollercoaster that i know is coming, just so i can get it over and done with? But i also know I can't force these things. So i'm just left with these conflicting thoughts in my head.
I'm not sure what I'm looking for by typing here, not so much condolences, more so people who have experienced something similar, and what their journey was? Maybe a story I can somewhat relate to or just some tips of how people got through their losses that are similar to mine.

Thanks

Im 28 years old and my mum died VERY EXEXPECTEDLY with a massive stroke/brain annerysm in November 2017. It was quite confronting as my brother, dad and I sat with her for days in ICU on life support completly unconcious  where we told we had to turn it off. It all went so fast and we just had to deal with what happend. Its been a year and a half but Im feeling like the grief is becoming a little harder. People who have/are experiencing greif. How long does it last? I know there is no right or wrong answer and I know everyone is different. But im just so mentally tired and drained from being so sad and not letting go. My boyfriend has been so supportive, I think its so unfair for him that I am so emotional all the time.

My mum died on the 23rd May this year. I was caring for her. To cope with not having her around I am imaging she is but I just can‚Äôt see her. I avoid all places and people so I can keep it real. My anxiety is up through the roof. Mum would have been 85 in October and we would have had a big family party for her. I‚Äôve withdrawn from some siblings. I‚Äôve organised mum and dads plague for their grave (dad died May  2009) one of my siblings doesn‚Äôt like it at all and has a different interpretation of the design. I was told it didn‚Äôt give mum the respect she deserved and that she regretted marrying my dad. This is heartbreaking. They weren‚Äôt the perfect couple and they did have some whooping arguments we all witnessed as children but there were good time‚Äôs as well.

Hey,
im new to this forum community. August 28 11:20pm my world changed forever. My Nan, my best friend passed away peacefully with pop and me by her side. She was 90 years old and was very sick near the end, she lasted 5 days of being unconscious until she passed away, those five days were tough sitting by her side watched her suffer and then watched her peacefully pass away which that moment was so special I will be forever grateful for. Nan and I had a very special bond. One like no other. We became even more close when Nan lost her daughter in January of 2016 after a short illness with brain cancer. My Aunty dying really hit nan hard which would to anyone.
anyway, this past week without nan have been extremely hard, I have cried, got angry and just been miserable and hurting. I‚Äôm after some advice that has helped in the early stages of grieving.
 
thanks

Hi there

I lost my dog a week ago to sudden illness. He was only 3.5yrs old and he was my everything.  He was my first dog that I rescued from a shelter.  He provided me with such support and gave me a purpose to keep going. Last year I started IVF and currently 2 rounds have failed and he was there to let me know I was loved and needed.  

Having him suddenly take ill and then dying has shocked me to my core. I can't be in my home alone as he is everywhere I look. I feel so guilty that I couldn't save him and miss him so terribly that I feel like the grief will swallow me whole.  I don't know how to function or move forward knowing he is not by my side. My boy was everything and now I have lost purpose.

I'm grieving the death of a man I loved.  He loved me too.  The difficulty is that I met him while I was volunteering at an aged care facility.  Of course there are rules about not allowing oneself to get too close or too involved with residents.  Sometimes, despite the rules, these things happen.  We formed a very special bond over a 5 month period.  Unfortunately, he told his family about his relationship with me and they, understandably, were concerned.  They brought the situation up with management, and of course I was reprimanded for my behavior.  They didn't know the extent of our relationship.........nobody did except for the two of us.  It wasn't something that we could share with others.  No matter how hard we tried, we would never have been able to make people understand.  The age difference for one, not to mention the fact that he had multiple medical issues etc.  
I was forced to leave and told not to contact him or his family.  I didn't get to say goodbye.  I don't know if anyone explained to him why I had to leave.  I've been so depressed and worried about him.  He passed away three days ago.  The grief I feel is making me sick.  I don't think it's just the grief.  It's all the things that happened, the way they happened and the fact that I have no one to help me work through my grief, because no one really knows how much we meant to each other.  My family know that I formed a friendship with him, but that's as far as it goes.  They feel for me in that respect, but must be wondering why my grief is so debilitating.  I have to cry in private, I have no one to talk to about the true relationship I had with him.
The last time I saw him was Boxing Day 2019.  Even though he was in his late eighties, very unwell and is no doubt in a much better place now, I still can't stop crying.  I can't seem to accept that he's gone.  My grief is making me sick.  Everything seems 'unreal'. Because I'm not a family member, I don't have anywhere to express my grief and sorrow at his passing.  I can't attend his funeral.  I just feel lost and helpless.

I don‚Äôt even know how to start... I‚Äôll just ramble on I‚Äôm sorry
so these days or these two weeks you could say(?) I‚Äôve been having dreams or nightmares about the same person that passed away in 2017. She was really special to me and basically took care of me my whole life and taught me so many things on life and all those stuff. They end the same way and whenever i wake up from my dreams my eyes would hurt and there‚Äôs be tears Falling down my face. I want those kind of dreams to stop because it‚Äôs been affecting me and all. I can clearly remember the dream Like its real life and i really hate it. The thing is I didn‚Äôt get to say goodbye to her so maybe that‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm having these dreams? But why after 2 years?
the dreams would go like this:(this is all like a vivid dream)
I‚Äôm with her and other people and it‚Äôs a normal day and the place I‚Äôm at is really beautiful for some reason i actually don‚Äôt know the place I‚Äôm not sure if it even exists in real life..anyways it‚Äôs like a normal day she‚Äôd be sitting in her chair watching tv and I‚Äôd be using my phone and going to her or sitting beside her annoying her and telling her about everything and anything that has been happening to me in real life and she‚Äôd give advice and stuff and the next thing I know, I‚Äôm crying telling her to not go and like trying to hold on to her and while begging her to stay and she‚Äôd just smile and the next thing i know it goes blank and other people are trying to calm me down but i was screaming that it‚Äôs not fair and that i never got to say goodbye to her but others did i never got to say I‚Äôm sorry and i hope you‚Äôre proud of me or i love you one last time my chest starts hurting and it goes blank 
That‚Äôs when I wake up. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I really want to talk to her just for an hour even in my dreams i never got the chance to tell her that I‚Äôve done this and that and I‚Äôve never got the chance to make her proud. All the things I‚Äôve achieved or done seems pointless to me now

Hi, I lost my beautiful Mother 2 months ago to Cancer.. she was only 56 and I 26. 
I have been in the grips of an emotional black hole since. I am heartbroken, lost and trying to find meaning in life to continue. The hardest thing is, the loss of connection and inability to connect to others who have been fortunate enough to not experience this pain. I am hoping to find others who have lost their mothers. 
I hope once we have found each other we can offer support, share stories and get through this together!

This afternoon I received a phone call from my mum that my oldest cousin on my dad's side had taken her own life in the past 24 hours. This is the first suicide in my family and I don't know how to deal with it. All my other relatives who have passed away in my life time has been old age, and or cancer - so it was sad but sadly expected. I'm not sure how to deal with this...she had shown no signs from what I viewed (mainly online as we live in different states) I was told she even went to her doctor to talk about her developing depression, in the past few days. All I am feeling right now is numb and feeling guilty, guilty because I don't know if I could have done something, or sensed that something was going on, i hope you know what I mean. I have seen her family online and I have no idea of what to say to them. What could I say to make it better? I just wish I could go and comfort them but I am in Adelaide and they are in Melbourne. I just need some advice of how to deal with this.

Hi everyone. I don‚Äôt usually post online and am new here. I lost my beloved Dad two weeks ago and am struggling. He had dementia and was deteriorating mentally and physically but everyone thought he had more time. They were wrong. I didn‚Äôt get the chance to sat a proper goodbye he was unconscious by the time I got to see him. It just hurts so much to know I‚Äôm never going to see him again. I feel so lost and raw. I can‚Äôt concentrate or focus and just want to hide away all the time. I would give absolutely anything for just a few minutes with him.

My dad died last week without any warning. I spoke with him an hour beforehand & he was absolutely fine. Mum said one minute he was talking to her & the next minute he had collapsed & couldn‚Äôt be resuscitated. 
I don‚Äôt want to believe it‚Äôs real. I‚Äôm angry sick people live for ages and healthy people like dad can just drop dead. 
I‚Äôm worried about mum who is completely broken and now questions the point of her own life now dads not here. 
He was a very respected person but we couldn‚Äôt hold the funeral he deserved as only 10 people were allowed and we couldn‚Äôt hold a wake because of covid. 
Its not fair. He was here one minute and gone the next.
We are unable to attend any grief support groups because of covid. I don‚Äôt know if they would help but it could be a start.
Its a roller coaster of sadness, disbelief & anger. If he could die without any warning whatsoever that means I could too. What‚Äôs the point of living.

Hi every one, my first post I will try to keep it short. I miss my grandson so much . It‚Äôs killing me inside.i was at his very short birth. My daughter rang me 3am when William was 24 days old. She was so tired, had a sick 3yo and hubby with the flue. William who we called Wilby had a cough. So I got over there , sent her to bed for some sleep and looked after Wilby, in the 4 hours I cuddled that sweet bub he wouldn‚Äôt drink his bottle. Well his little family woke and I told my daughter to give him some breast milk as he wouldn‚Äôt drink any bottle, then I said he was lethargic let‚Äôs take him to hospital he is dehydrated. As I put Wilby in the car he gave a little grin. 25 minutes later we get to hospital, my daughter gets his bag and it‚Äôs my job to put my grandsons in and out of the cars. As I got him out I thought he was asleep, as I wrapped him in his blankie he made a terrible sound, as I looked at him, he was gone , I screamed to my daughter as I have her Wilby and yelled to her¬† run. After what seen like hours they got a pulse. Well really 3 hospitals and 4 days later he took his last breath. That dear sweet Wilby was dying in my arms and I didn‚Äôt know. What kind of granma am I? I am not coping and still see his mum‚Äôs pain in her eyes and the heart break as she held him for hours . Then to drive 2 hours home without him in his car seat. I breath him, think about him Every moment of the day and really want to be with him . I just can‚Äôt get over the thought if I‚Äôd only woke her and said let‚Äôs go now , Wilby would still be here. Sad granma

So, on my birthday at the beginning of the year. i lost my poppy, now he was a very special man. he meant the absolute world to myself and my family. and his death was so so sudden. i felt so numb. then a few days later, i saw a post on Facebook that a girl i used to dance with had passed away, and i immediately text the sister of the girl and say ' i am so sorry, she was so beautiful. i will see you in a few days,' Because i knew her and her family for most of my childhood. god she was only young, i felt so numb inside.
then the hard part was who funeral do i go to, and i sat down and i looked up and i knew my poppy would understand why i wouldn't be saying goodbye to him with everyone else. 
when i got there, i found the sister and we cried in each others arms. for so long. they were my family too. 
and on top of all this, i was in a very toxic relationship. he just wasn't helping me. and i couldn't have the loss of these two amazing people in my life, piled on top of my toxic relationship. so during all of that, i was also going through quite a tough breakup.
its been 7 months, and i thought i was getting better and better. but its all coming back. its just all in my head.

Firstly I hope everyone who still have their mum really appreciated them not just for today but every day.
Sadly I lost mine on 31st July 2015.  I have good memories and a visit to the cemetery gave me some sense of peace. I had the opportunity to be with her when she left. Sadly during this pandemic not all people got that opportunity. For
Those people I feel so sad for you and hope you can think of them in better days. To all mums please have a safe and healthy day. A friend of mine said to me that every day is mothers day as they never take a day off. My mum said make
Every day count as no use feeling regret once they have gone. This I managed to do before she left so this makes my 
loss a lot easier.  Isolation may be hard but a loss is harder. Appreciate what you have now for this period will not last
Forever.

Hello,
It is important that you learn to be resilient after a loss of a loved one. Sometimes, we just need to chill out by ourselves for a short time or spend time with happy people. Imagine a ball bouncing back up to you. Life should be just like that when a setback happens. Bounce back from negative events quickly.

Hello everyone. Two weeks ago, my partner of 9 years died. He had been ill since last year and his death was not peaceful. Shortly before he died, I discovered some unpleasant things about my partner. I wonder if I really knew him and if he really loved me. To make matters worse, there are several toxic adult children from his previous marriage who are making life difficult for me. I find it difficult to grieve properly for the loss of my partner because I'm very confused about the person he really was. Friends advise me to try to remember the happy times in our relationship but I feel betrayed and let down by my partner. Any advice?

New to this forum and not really sure where to start. Guess I'll start by sharing my story. Going back 9 weeks now my partner and love of my life took her own life. I won't go into details as it's still very raw and hard to talk about. There isn't a day that goes by where I'm not over come with grief. Tears are shed and I become sick with how my h I miss her. As most that have suffered something similar would know, I still struggle with guilt for not being able to help or be there. I all ways feel alone even when I'm around friends and family. I'm lucky that I have a good support group around me but they have never had to go through something like this, so they help me best they know how, which is great. But even then I can't talk about what I'm feeling or thinking as it's all new to them. So I guess that's why I decided to reach out on this forum. I know there is no time that will go past that will make it easier, but hopefully it does get some what more bearable to live with. Cause at the moment I'm not sure it ever will. Well thanks for reading.

Hi everyone, 
When I was 13, my Mum had a severe stroke that left her paralysed on one side of her body and with some memory loss.
My Mum was basically my Dad's carer at the time, as he had a genetic illness and his mental health declined over the years. 
They both moved into nursing homes, as they needed extra care and considering I was young I couldn't look after them myself.
Late 2018, my mum's health declined and in March 2019 she passed away. 
Fast forward 14 months later (last month) my Dad unfortunately passed away.
My parent's Doctors both put them into palliative care. My mum was in it for 6 months, whereas my Dad passed away within 5 days. 
Mum lost so much weight and looked unrecognisable in the end and Dad was a shock as he went for a checkup for something else and the doctor said he had until the end of the week to live, due to fluid in his lungs. 
They seemed to be in a lot of pain in their final week. 
I'm 26 now and I've struggled a lot with depression and anxiety over the years, but I can't shake the regret, anger and sadness I have with myself. I feel like I was in a state of denial for so long about their declining health, that I didn't see them as much as I should've. I have so much regret about not spending their last day with them and not being there in their final hours. I really hope they knew how much I loved and appreciated them.
I'm an only child aswell and even though I know I have a lot of supportive family members and friends, I still feel so alone during this time.
I'm the only one in my friendship group that has lost a parent, let alone both. 

I will be returning to counselling at some point but can't physically speak about this face to face without breaking down. I find it hard to talk to my friends about this, because they haven't experienced something similar and I feel they have issues of their own and I don't want to burden them.
I'm also stressed about their cemetery plaque, as I don't know what to write or do for it.
Their funerals both seem like a blur to me, especially my Dad's which was only 3 weeks ago.
I just wanted to know if there was a way to help manage feelings of regret and grief?
If anyone reading this has attended a grief support group in person, was it helpful connecting with others compared to just a counsellor?
Thank you!

I don't like to label myself, but these are the keywords of my story - lost mum, an only child, Chinese, living remotely. I am seeking help.
I have been
chatting with a Psychologist since April this year, however, I still don't know how to cope with my mum's death. She was my biggest supporter, she was always there, she was my bestie... My stomach is still in knots. I cannot even unfold any of her clothing. My tears are flowing any time I remember her face and the last picture haunting me in my mind was her body was full of tubes and her closed eyes.
Exactly 4 months ago today, I lost my mum so suddenly. I was on my lunch break at work and was told by my auntie, my mum was in ICU and after 4 hours, she is gone, heart-attack. She was only 59!  I was even talking to her on messenger the day before, everything was fine, no last words, she was gone. I was in Australia, she was in China. My husband and I flew immediately back to China the next day and attended the funeral, only days before China and Australia locked down both countries.
Because of the Covid-19 situation, after 14 days of quarantine in China, many tasks were still outstanding. I have not yet chosen the tomb. Things are undone, unfinished. According to Chinese culture, I haven't completed/performed my duty to my mum yet. Her ashes were stored in a small box in a storeroom at a funeral house.
I am the only carer of my mum (my Dad and Mum separated), I feel really guilty in the whole situation; if I don't live in Australia, if I can spend more time with her, these things may not happen.
My husband, Australian and Chinese families, friends, work, boss, colleagues, have been providing great support to me. Coming back to Australia, we have been quarantined for another 14 days self -isolation and since then I have been working from home. Due to a career advancement decision, my husband and I moved to a remote regional country town, there are no family members and close friends here. I miss the face-to-face chat.
I don't know how to deal with the whole situation, my best mentor - she left me, I don't know how to deal with life without her.
Help me, as an extroverted person I think talking about this on an online forum might help.

My cat liked to spend a lot of time playing outdoors. My biggest nightmare was always her getting lost out there, or getting hurt. It was the source of a lot of anxiety for me and there were multiple times where I cried thinking she was lost if she took too long to come back inside. On top of that I tend to catastrophize and always had this impending fear of the pain it would cause me to lose her because she meant so much to me.

My cat got hit by a car and passed away yesterday. Amongst all the pain I feel a weird sense of relief about not having to feel continuously anxious about her anymore. 

I can‚Äôt help but feel selfish or heartless for feeling relieved. I really hope I gave her the best life possible and would do anything to hold her again.

Hi everyone, one of my closest friend's immediate family member passed away several hours ago. He was a critical stage corona patient and suffered greatly. My friend, or anyone else, cannot attend the funeral because of the quarantine. I want to be a good friend and support her, but I don't know what to say. I am genuinely out of resources here. I would be very grateful if you guys can share some pointers on bedside manner or whatever. Thanks in advance.

I lost my mum three days ago.
She was my best friend and my only parent, and I loved her very much. She got her diagnosis three weeks before she passed away and was in hospital that whole time. It took me about two weeks to come to terms with her diagnosis and I did occasionally feel heavy and a bit sad (but nowhere near as sad as I thought I should‚Äôve felt) but after a certain point I made peace with the fact that she was going to die, and I feel like that peace came way too quickly and easily.
On the day she passed away I felt an initial shock, and I cried a bit while getting dressed and taking a taxi to the hospital, but then I felt fine. I was apprehensive to see her corpse, but when I did, I was shocked at how okay I was. It felt normal. What I‚Äôm feeling is not an emotional numbness but a normalcy. Not having her around the house even feels normal, which is bizarre.
It‚Äôs been three days and I‚Äôm not thinking about her a lot. When I do I feel fine. I can even think about her corpse and feel fine. I know people say this can happen with grief, but this just feels different. It‚Äôs not a numbness, I‚Äôm feeling other emotions, I can even have fun when I do things like play games. I‚Äôm not dissociated at all either.
It might be worth noting that I‚Äôve never lost someone before, I‚Äôve had a lot of cats die though, cats that I loved very much, and I also never grieved them.
So yeah. Any advice? Does anyone relate? I feel terrible about this, like I‚Äôm disrespecting her.

Hi, this is my first time ever posting on a forum but I just needed to get my emotions out. My dad passed away very suddenly a month ago and I am really struggling to make it through every day without breaking down. I have moved back in with my mum (I'm only 19 by the way) as I was living away for university so I have her, my brother, and my boyfriend as support but I am so upset. As soon as I am alone I just start crying and I am terrified to fall asleep because anytime I try I just can't stop the emotions coming out. My parents were divorced so I have lived with my mum since I was 11 and so I didn't see my dad as much as I should've because we all think they'll be there forever so I was always too busy to see him, but when I did see him it was great and he always gave me the best hugs. I just have no idea how I'm supposed to keep going on, I was in the middle of final exams for uni and I have deferred for a few more weeks but I'm struggling to study and that is stressing me out as well so I am just completely lost at the moment and I have an appointment with a psysohologsist in the next couple of weeks but I'm struggling every day to get by. we cleaned out his room a few days ago and it was so hard. I just keep waiting for him to walk in a room and tell me it'll be okay and give me a big hug and even though I have the support I feel so alone and like no one can understand what I'm going through. and I just feel so angry at the world because he's supposed to be there to watch me grow up and graduate uni and have a family and help me move into my first house and lecture about not cleaning my car enough and he's not going to be there and I don't know how I'm ever going to be okay with that. He was struggling with health recently which is what he died from but it was still so sudden because it only started a few months ago, because of this he had to leave work and one of the last messages he sent to me was how at least now he wasn't working he would be around to watch me graduate. He was so scared and I kept telling him it would be okay because I thought it would be because he was only 54 and I thought that it would be okay, and I really can't stop thinking about if he knew he was dying and if he in pain because that makes me so sad.

Day in and day out. He's here, sedated, with a ventilator, screens, tubes beeps. Uncertainty: will he ever come back home? 3 days before my husband went to hospital, he was diagnosed with autism. 28 years of a difficult life with him, with some good times in between. Was it dementia? or was it depression? what was it?. Now, we had a few years ahead of us with some counselling, I'd be able to endure his lack of understanding, his aloofness . We'd get closer  and enjoy the last years of our life. But no, it was not meant to be, I had to call an ambulance, we are apart.Everytime the phone rings, I think 'This is the hospital, he's gone'. Living like this is absolute hell, I can't bear it.

Hi everyone, 
I just want to share my story of the people I had loss. When I was 9 years old I lost my dad  to an illness, and since I was younger at that time, I did not know the full extent of grief and loss. Now and then I would be sad and miss him so much. But looking back at it now, I can't imagine what my mum was going through. Especially since we  just arrived to Australia as refugees. Not only did my mum lose a husband but she had to adapt to a new country, learn a new language and look after her 3 kids as a widow. 
I am so grateful for everything she's done for us and how strong she is for looking after us as a widow with no husband or other immediate family members in Australia. Since mental health is a taboo topic in my cultural, I never really had a conversation with her on how she coped.
Nonetheless, fast forward to 2019 my mum found a new partner, and told us she was pregnant. Since my mum was a bit older now, there is a high risk of carrying a baby. I was especially  mad when I found out because I thought instead of retiring soon, she will have to restart with her life and start motherhood all over again. I know I was extremely selfish for saying that and feeling that way, which I REGRET the most till this day.  Also, I did not have a good relationship with my step-dad (to me it felt like he was replacing my dad) which made the situation worst. 
Slowly, I started accepting the reality of my mum's pregnancy and having a sister, I was excited and planned out a life for her. However, suddenly my mum complained of stomach pain and i took her to the hospital. Unfortunately, during the ultrasound, the doctor could not find my sister's heart beat. I just started crying and felt so guilty for everything. What's worst is that my mum felt she had to act strong in front of me and till this day, she rarely shows her emotions to us. I honestly can't not imagine what she is going through right now. I feel so much pain and sadness for my mother. Everyday I would think of her and I would feel guilty and full of regrets.
 Even though she's not with us, she will be in our hearts and we miss her everyday. I just hope my mum  and step-dad is coping well. 
Thanks for reading

Hi, my name's Layne, last year I lost my dad a week before his birthday, he passed from pneumonia. He pretty much raised me, i was and still not close with my mum, I currently live in Sydney whilst he lived in New Zealand, so going home has been hard, I've only been home twice since he left, a day before his funeral and 1 year after, I feel like I'm the only one who's grieving, my family act as if his passing meant nothing, I tear up every time i see a photo of him, I avoid talking about him because i get emotional, i can't talk my family about how I feel because I feel like noone is listening, Is there anything I can do to get over it?

Hello to anyone reading this,

I am looking for support, as my father committed suicide this morning, and I am having abit of trouble coping. 

My father was a good man, with no outward signs of suicidal thoughts. 

He is loved so much, by so many people. He has 10 times the amount of friends that I do. He always tried to make others happy, and was a great friend.

Everyone in mine and my fathers family and friend circle are shocked, and absolutely devastated.

Last week, my partner gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. They are currently overseas caught up in this virus bullshit, and my father never got to see him.

I am just so hurt, upset, angry, confused and lost. 

If anyone can reccomend a place to start to help, that would be great. 


Fighting back tears,

I‚Äôd just turned 18 three months before I took the test that showed up with two pink lines. Looking back now, I wish I‚Äôd made more of an effort to keep it safe, it was the only thing connecting me to my baby and it was lost when we moved houses.
I wasn‚Äôt in a relationship. I was barely an adult. But I knew for sure when my doctor asked me what I wanted to do, I couldn‚Äôt go through with an abortion.
But two weeks later I got the news most pregnant people don‚Äôt want to hear. I was miscarrying. 
I never heard their heartbeat. I never got to see them. They were just gone. Two amazing weeks thinking I was going to be a mummy, taken from me just like that.
I‚Äôm 24 now and I still really struggle with the loss of my baby. Thoughts keep running through my mind.. what could I have done differently? Is it my fault I lost my baby? Will I ever have a family? 
It feels like I‚Äôll never get another chance at having a family and my heart hurts. My heart hurts thinking about the child I could‚Äôve had. How they would‚Äôve started school this year. I feel like I‚Äôve missed so much because my chance at being a mother was taken from me and sometimes I just really can‚Äôt cope with that.

I come under the heading of ""dutiful child"". Visited in Nursing home at least weekly. Prior to that rang and visited. I did the right thing for people who didnt do right by me.I sat by their bed day and night in those last few days. I held their hand as they passed. Such a ""good"" child.
Am I grieving what should have been, what could have been. Some siblings arent that upset. Some are more nostalgic about the few decent things from our childhood. One cut them both off completely.
Why do I cry? why do I grieve?

I'm coping, just. xx  Best wishes to anyone going through loss, grief anxiety (i've started calling panic attacks ""stress moments""), .I hate the words panic and attack!

I've just recently lost my Nan suddenly. During this Covid-19 pandemic. Attempting to be there for the funeral was proven to be a challenge but not impossible. I was still able to fly interstate without needing to quarantine. I was still able to comfort those who could be there. I was also there to make some hard decisions and funeral arrangements. My Nan was like the next figure in life to what people call one a ""Mum""... Long story short. I helped care for my Nan before she went into a home from all my teenage years. I'm having trouble coping with her being just ""Gone"" I felt like i didn't have time to grieve or be sad or to even laugh or cry. You become busy deciding the colour of her coffin and what photo to choose best and what flowers she would of loved by the time the day comes around your not ready to say goodbye yet. Due to the pandemic outbreak and states having their own lockdown and regulations i had to leave 1 day earlier before the service. I wasn't able to be there till the end to even lay her down. Instead i had to watch from a screen and feel at a distance. I'm vividly struggling sometimes to sleep. I can still feel her cold holds against mine and although i still got to see her and kiss her and share upon the memories we had together. I wasn't ready to say goodbye or let go. Now shes been floating around me in thoughts, in my dreams and i just feel like there's a lump in my throat that's hard to explain the presence of. How does one find ways to accept this passing and move forward in life?

My amazing Mum was in good health, no pain, paying $5000/month for [we thought] top-notch care and to be kept safe. Well, management dropped the ball, kicked it across town to another agency, who also dropped the ball, passed the buck - not telling us anything or bullshitting us. For those $$ you'd think you'd get the best care and decent food. Not so. I honestly think she would've been safer next door in the hotel for $125/night max and still have $50/day for food; towels and bedding changed daily, bathroom cleaned daily. Instead, Mum was getting meals brought up on a tray and left at her door. The management kept slipping long and convoluted letters under the doors of ALL residents many - like Mum - with impaired vision, memory loss and cognitive difficulties. The morning they found Mum in a bad state - paramedics were called and they didn't take the envelope with all her instructions, phone numbers, etc. One person said they weren't allowed to touch or take anything; another said they hadn't heard of that rule. Then they said probable UTI (probable more BS), possible RSV and possible Covid19. She had a cough and no fever and they put her on oxygen and ran tests including Covid19 which, they say, came back negative. They then moved her either to or from the acute ward to Covid19 ward and she was now a bit more alert, not eating much, still on oxygen but with ""gurgly"" lungs. But, remember, they said negative to Covid19 yet they were going to do more tests. Didn't happen. Next thing, she is ""gone"". They say some kind of pneumonia likely one of the manifestations of Covid19. Mum didn't deserve to die like that. Criminal negligence! More lies about cause of death so they don't panic or scare the other residents, presumably, and protect their precious reputation. If this is a first-rate aged care home (in Canada) I shudder to think what the budget places are like. And - the icing on the bullshit mound - today I get an update email from the GM of the home (who knew Mum had died as she phoned my sister today to offer her condolences) - one of the ""Happy Families/Aren't We All Wonderful"" updates about how there are NO problems, they have lots to CELEBRATE and happy-everyone photos and stories but no mention of my mother. Nothing. Not even a lie that she had died of pneumonia not Covid19 related. This is why I don't trust anyone and I am devastated. Like in all wars, truth is the first casualty. Insensitivity is the next.

I am 18 years old and I was 12 when my dad committed suicide. I am an older sibling to my younger brother who is now 16, and I feel that over the past 5 years I have been the older sister and supported him, along with my mum. By doing this I have forgotten about myself and I feel like the grief is only just hitting me now. I hate talking about my dad and the way he died and I hate seeing therapists. I am afraid to cry in front of my family or even talk to my family about how I feel because we don‚Äôt really talk about it anymore. My mums boyfriend and his son have just moved in which makes bringing up the topic even worse as they are always around. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Hi. Ive come on here as my back story is I lost my soul mate , the love of my life in a work place truck accident March2018 on his birthday , 8 months prior my bff girlfriend of 35 years passed away and  Feb 10th this year my mum passed away . The three closest people to me who loved me unconditionally . I have 3 daughters but the relationship is not like that of with my mum. . They think support is inviting to a grand child's soccer game . . I lost my fathers at 9 years old, identical to Daniel trucks and logs . Daniels death is still going with lawyers , Work safe etc . I am going to lawyer today to sign to be administrator of Mums will. For over 30 years my brother was Executor, he's a multi millionaire so when Mum passed he would‚Äôve just brought his people in and had them clean her unit out etc . Nope 3 weeks before she passed he threw the paper work at me and washed his hands . I was the  last person to be dealing with this . It just gets worse . So Im going to cut to now . I thought there had to be  a group of some sort as when you live on own your beyond isolated . I do take meds for depression and anxiety , its genetic so with the death and trauma , it was a no brainer . Everyone in family on medication . As that first loss at 9 years didn't stop there . The death has gone on till Mum this years . Im 55 years . Prior to Daniel I had run a successful Family Day Care business for 17 years . My Service had been accredited by the National Quality Framework Exceeding . I re opened my Service 22 months after Daniel passed . Mum passed 3 weeks into reopening but I was pretty good, kept it running with experienced help, my daughter . I am so unmotivated , its stepped up since Covid I know I am hard on myself and feel you have to be actively doing something or be productive in someway otherwise its wrong . For me-that is. I was diagnosed with Adult Adhd at 48 year. My Support group now who I am truly grateful for are all paid people but without them not being on my level or not understanding me , I don't know how I would've kept going .... Tears. I feel I have cried almost everyday at same stage during day for 2 years . Thank you ...Maree

My mum passed away on Easter morning in Canada during the COVID19 outbreak - but not from the virus. Australia and Canada closed their borders to international travel before I could get on a plane to be with her and my Canadian family. The world was in lockdown. Since then I‚Äôve gone from being an optimistic and calm person to being paralysed with grief and anxiety. I can‚Äôt seem to function in any normal way, have cancelled virtual meetings and now have severe gastro and convinced I have COVID.. My husband is being supportive and we‚Äôre using virtual platforms but nothing seems to help. What else should I be doing to move through this?

In my experience with my own grieving and observing others, there is an initial period where others input has virtually no effect.
During this period, which varies in length depending on the person, we can be there and listen, reassure with comforting words etc. However it can be counter productive telling someone ""you'll get over it"" or ""its for the best"". That's because pure 100% grief hasn't room for logic nor room for reason nor explanation. 
What if you are the person in grief?. After this initial period, there will be a time when you'll return to your pre grief life, work, shopping etc. But you'll still be in grief. This is the point at which I encourage some strategies. Eg
Im dedicating next year to my father. He'll want me to be as happy as I could be.
Im going to create a corner of my garden to my sister. A place with a garden seat and climbing roses, her favourite flower
My brother did not enjoy good health. I will in his honour, care for myself because he never had that opportunity.
And so on.
The art of channelling, which is what I referred to above is infinite in its realm of creativity and its an individual thing. It can make us extend ourselves beyond our projected capacity. Ever seen Olympians dedicate their journey of competition to a loved one?
But IMO the greatest motivating factor is children. Those of us that have walked that dark path of suicidal thoughts and/or plans know that thinking of how we will leave our loved ones in trauma and grief can be a huge motivating factor for us to sever the idea and dedicate our lives to our children or loved ones.
When I lost my wonderful dad I decided to ensure I would one day leave the world of my children with a similar memory...
In summary-
To assist yourself in coping with grief, allow yourself a period of time that you alone feel is the right length of time to just grieve....and not much else except comforting others.
Then put in place ways of honouring your loved one and living your life as they would want you to.
Finally, not to make their passing in vain. Grab hold of their legacy they've left and in their name ...never let it go. For that memory is priceless. Use that gift to leave a similar memory for other loved ones you will one day leave behind.
Thats how I make sense of the passing of loved ones.
Do you have strategies in coping with the passing of a loved one you'd like to share?
Your ideas could help someone else

it‚Äôs been 6 week since i‚Äôve lost my best friend to suicide and i‚Äôm so lost. she was only 18 and we had so many plans together. she was my soul mate i swear. we never fought, we were so similar, yet so different. she was so beautiful and the most caring and giving person i have and will ever meet in my life. i‚Äôm so blank without her. i only turned 17 a couple of months ago and with this isolation, loss of friends and social contact and the ability to come and go as i please to the outside i don‚Äôt know how i‚Äôm going to continue to do this. it‚Äôs so hard. we continuously talked about all the stuff we were finally going to do when i finally turned 18 and now she‚Äôs gone and left me and i‚Äôm so lost, so lifeless. i just want her next to me, to just hear her sweet laugh one more time, or her beautiful smile. i‚Äôm just so empty, i have no care for anything anymore. and i wouldn‚Äôt per say i was suicidal as i could never even think to wish the pain of losing a loved one to my family and friends, but i just have no care anymore. i got in a really bad car accident 2 weeks ago where I could have died but i just didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt care. this isolation is killing me even more slowly cause i have no way to grieve other than crying in my bed or just laying there with no emotion. i just wanna know if there‚Äôs any tips or things i can do to fix me.

Hi all,
So a week ago my husband of 26 years mentioned that friends of ours had emailed him with a family update for Christmas (my husband and he had worked together some years ago). So in a spare moment I picked up his iPad and looked for the friends email. Next to their email is another, and I could see the first line as you do in Outlook. It ready, ‚Äúit worked honey, I love you‚Äù. Of course I opened it and it went downhill from there. I requested an explanation... I was lied to..I persisted...more detail was given with reassurances that now I knew everything. More lies came out.  Only thing is, after 26 years, I know when he is avoiding talking about something. Fast forward to today. It is now one week later. I can‚Äôt eat, I feel sick. I feel so alone it is overwhelming. I am in so much pain I actually howled! As a military wife, I have always been the strong one, raising kids while he was deployed, dealing with career losses of my own because of postings, supporting my family and his family  - including supporting his Dad through a terminal illness and ultimately burying him while my husband was deployed. Everyone leans on me, and I don‚Äôt know how to deal with the pain, the loss, the sick feeling. How do I even begin to deal with this? And the harsh realization that I don‚Äôt have a support network. My friends are work colleagues from over the years or joint couple friends. I don‚Äôt feel I can turn to them.

So, I was really close with my grandmother and because of that when she passed away i couldn‚Äôt handle it. I couldn‚Äôt accept the fact of her passing away. I didn‚Äôt even get to say goodbye to her I couldn‚Äôt even hug her one last time. 

I feel really guilty for some reason. I kept on blaming myself for not realising that she‚Äôs ill sooner. I blame myself for not paying attention to her I blame myself for not making her go to the doctors sooner. I blame myself for not being the grandchild she deserves. It‚Äôs been three years and whenever I think about her I Can‚Äôt stop crying. I feel mad at myself and mad at the doctors for not taking good care of her. 
I try to get over it and be happy that she‚Äôs in a better place now but I can‚Äôt help it. I tear up whenever someone mentions her. There‚Äôs this sharp pain that I feel in my chest whenever I think about her and I can‚Äôt stop blaming myself. I really miss her hugs and her lectures, I really want to apologise to her and say goodbye properly one last time Hug her for one last time, tell her that I love her for one last time but I can‚Äôt because she‚Äôs not here anymore.

Hi everyone,
This is a statement I never thought I'd make. I can finally understand why we have funerals.  
Yesterday hubby told me our friend had died in an accident. The last time I saw him was fleeting (work colleague of his needed help) so we didn't get to chat. I told him next time I wanted to hear all about his last skiing holiday. 
Now gatherings are banned due to Coronavirus. No funeral. No gathering of his and hubby's volunteer group to celebrate him. Can't visit his partner to help with cleaning or cooking... Nothing.
I've never understood the point of public funerals until today. Other funerals I've been to have been for family. I've been involved and included and it made me feel more upset having to grieving publicly. Now as someone who isn't family I think I'm starting to understand.
I feel like the point of gathering is to introduce his family to other people who loved him too. People they can ask for support. People they can talk to when they're ready to talk about him. Maybe even to share stories. 
It helped us to focus on what we can do right now rather than what we can't. 
Maybe someone might feel able to share what has helped you to grieve within the current restrictions?
Our ideas...

Hubby and I put a movie on for our kids and sat outside in the sun on the swing together. Just allowed ourselves time to sit together and think. 
I told hubby the two memories that always came to mind when I thought of our friend. When I feel sad I remind myself of those memories.
We chose to focus on the fact there is no time limit on grieving. When the restrictions end we'll ask his partner if she'd like to have a celebration and help organise it. If not that is ok too.
 Same with his volunteer group. We'll ask if they want to do something to celebrate our friend.
I wrapped up a box of shelf stable food and supplies. Nice things like coffee, tea, bikkies and chocolate but also basics like loo paper, UHT milk and tissues. Hubby went to the store and got what he could. I figured his partner might not feel up to shopping. We left it at her front door.
Hubby put a little money in the card. I felt weird about it at first but he explained the last thing he'd want on top of grief is financial worry. Makes sense. 
We put our contact numbers in the card too in case she didn't have them. 
In a week or two I'm going to leave another box. I'll print some adult colouring in pages and put textas and pencils in this one. Some seeds if I can find some.

Hi,
theres a bunch of reasons why I have to re home my two beautiful dogs. I‚Äôm moving interstate for work and can‚Äôt take them (they‚Äôre old and wouldn‚Äôt travel well plus inner city apartment living wouldn‚Äôt be fair for them). 
I‚Äôve had them for 9 and 8 years and even though I know logically the decision I‚Äôve made is in their best interests, I can‚Äôt help but feel overwhelming guilty.
A rescue group has helped me to find a suitable new home for them (so they could do all of the proper checks etc that I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to do as well) and they‚Äôve found an amazing family for them. I have to meet at a park next weekend to hand them over.
i feel like I‚Äôm letting them down. I feel like a terrible human - they have loved me so much and the last thing I‚Äôm doing is giving them up. 
Not really sure how to get through this pain.

I recently lost my best friend of 21 years after a long battle with cancer. My friendship with her had plenty of ups and downs but we always found our way back to each other. I have bipolar disorder and for awhile I pushed everyone away including her. After about 2 years I finally reach out to her again and our friendship picked straight back up like we never spent any time apart.  I spent her final year speaking every single day and I was last friend around when her final weeks came. I spent her last day out of hospital with her and was her final text message. Now she's gone and I feel so alone. I might sound crazy, but I always thought I'd get some sort of sign from her after she passed, but nothing. I'm so glad she's finally cancer free and pain free. I feel like I'm never going to have a close friend again. How am I supposed to make new friends without comparing to what I had. I keep thinking I'm going to get a text or a call from her any day now. I don't know how to move on from crying every night.

My partner recently had an abortion. We were in a long term relationship, she had consistent doubts about our compatibility and future.

Hi all,
I would desperately like to express my deepest feelings I had when I heard the news, if I could. Yet my mind fails to come up with a reasonable response like I didn't care. I DO care.
I'm stuttering to write meaningful sentences, but these sentences honestly feel dull and bland. One might say I sound neutral, but I'm not trying to be. I really do care about such a friend. It's almost as if my body feels painless despite being stabbed, and that pain can't even register. 
I had expected a simple conversation, the usual chats from my mother after tennis training. But the sudden gloomy sentence of ""terrible news"" had sent me into confusion. ""H passed away in his sleep this morning. If you want to say the last goodbye, I'll let you know when the funeral is.""
(I've abbreviated his name as I do not feel like disclosing it now.)
It was over. It could not be. He was such a great friend from primary school, and we stayed together until secondary school where I left to seek the prestigious schools. To see him gone and never be capable of returning just feels like being stabbed in the back, yet not notice any pain.""This fate just wants to take everything I love and slowly destroy it!"" I would think. Am I feeling insensitive, or is something wrong with me? 
 I wish I could have wrung out some of my spare time, perhaps to see him again, enjoy lunch together, to at least cherish our friendship once more. But as much as I beg, it simply won't come back. 
Sorry if I can't think of a better way to describe this event. Perhaps I'll return with more info when I make up my mind.

Hi all u good people

I'm struggling with depression a lot lately. And I'm still struggling with some losses in the family. The reason I'm posting here is I'm hoping someone might have some insight as to what might be going on. Am I still struggling with the deaths of loved ones ""because"" I'm having mental heath issues? or am I experiencing depression (at least in part) ""because"" of my personal losses? The deaths in the family have happened some time ago and I'd have thought I should have moved on by now.

Lost my dad 2 years ago to cancer, this one hurts most, the ground just doesn't feel solid anymore, he was my rock
Lost my sister and niece together tragically and unexpected 7 years ago and my mum died shortly after due to complications from a rare blood condition (and I believe sadness after losing her daughter)

I only have my little sister left out of my immediate family and I need to be present for her and for my wife and kids, and I'm not at the moment.

He has threatened suicide just yesterday (not the first time) and I‚Äôm so lost as to how to help him and myself. Please can someone give me some advice or even just .. anything that may help

I was there on the Saturday afternoon you were born and then on the Saturday you left us. It has been the thirteen longest years of my life and I mourn your passing every day. It is said that time heals all wounds but that is just a fallacy, this is one that wont heal until we meet again. I still feel an immense anger toward your treating Physician and his lack of concern on the day you passed.
The death of my son brought great sorrow to all those who knew him. He was a very strong boy and had the nick name of 'Boof Head'. This he earned during a junior football game when he carried a number of the opposition on his back and scored a try. His greater passion though was baseball. He commenced playing tee-ball at age 5 and continued on through to senior level. While as a junior he represented the local area in the 'State Cup' competition. My boy's other passion was his own son.
He passed away in February, 2006 after being in Hospital suffering from ‚ÄúGoodpasture Syndrome‚Äù in his lungs. For a month he was placed in an induced coma and was given chemo therapy, blood cleansing treatment, blood transfusions, treatment for this, that kind of treatment, nothing seemed to be fighting against this anti-body disease of unknown origin that had my son in it's grips. On January 30 that year while visiting him in Intensive Care, his mum, fiance and myself were taken aside, behind a curtain and I was to receive the worst birthday present any father could be given. The ICU Registrar advised us that because my eldest was so ill, he wasn't expected to make it through the night. A couple of weeks later they took him off the respirator and brought him out of the coma. The battle was over. My son had pulled through. As a celebration of his home coming, we all went for tea. It was a fantastic Friday night dinner. One I'll never forget.
He passed away the following day.
His funeral was held¬†around 10 days after his parting. There were approximately 300 in attendance from all walks of life. School friends, baseball, work and even politics. I was amazed how many hearts he'd touched in some way in his short 23 years.
Mate your death has affected me in a way that is just so hard to explain. I look forward to meeting and being with you in the after-life. Be it tomorrow or whenever.

So two weeks ago my mother shared that she has been diagnosed with terminal cancer (5 years tops), a few days after this my grandfather (who I was very close to) passed - its not like the movies with the shutter of the eyelids. He was in panic as he went. But to keep the rest of the family in happy oblivion I lied and said he passed peacefully in his sleep. Last week we buried him and it nearly broke me while I tried to keep it together for my family.
I have put my studies on hold while I deal, reached out to the cancer council and have an appointment coming up. It was just, so much sadness. But it soon turned to anger. Before leaving to spend time with my family, I left detailed instructions for my boss to pass along to my team, so that the office could keep going in my absence. When I came back (today) I found out that the email had not been forwarded on, that no work had been done, and that stakeholders were angry with me for not contacting them for near a fortnight (the stakeholders anger quickly turned to the company and they apologised for their rude emails after a quick phone call explaining the situation). So now I have to deal with a fortnight backlog daily. 
I don't know what to do, I am just so angry with my work for being incapable of so much as forwarding on a message (it's diverting my emotional energy away from my real feelings I guess). At the same time, I am still grieving, I can't so much as make a cup of tea without breaking down in tears. But with no leave, sick days or savings all I can do is grudgingly go back into work.
I feel so pathetic, I can't deal with my Pops recent death, let alone my Mums encroaching one. I don't want to be a sad sac, but I can't find joy in anything and dread waking up each morning. I don't know what to do and it makes me feel pathetic (that 'glorious' spiral, am I right?) I haven't been suicidal for a few years now, and I'm not, but this is some new low I didn't realise I could get to emotionally. Should I divert the energy into going for other jobs? Should I run away and take a job in another country again? What should I do while I wait for the cancer council to contact me? I just don't know...

I watch my nan pass away with dementia in August 2018 she was a very big part of my life. Then in March 2019 i  watched my sister give birth to my neice with passed away right there in the delivery room. Then in May 2019 my beautiful mother aged 57 passed away from cancer. I've lost people before but living without my mum is really painful. Since mums passed ive started to use drinking & drugs to numb my pain. My realatship with my bf of 14 years is starting to change my everyday living has i dont seem to care about anything anymore. I dont know how to handly all this loss in 8months of eachother. I dont feel ready to talk to a dr its to painful to say out loud to a stranger. I'm really lost atmüò≠ ive been griefing alot to i dont talk to my silbing about our I cant put that sadness on tthem or worry..

For the last few months I‚Äôve had a new psychologist, who has really helped me and gave me hope for the future, and she got me, and made me feel accepted and understood.  Last week she told me she had resigned from her current position and is leaving.  I am devastated from this loss and feeling overwhelmed with sadness.  I‚Äôve still got one more private session with her and two group sessions before she leaves, is it inappropriate to ask her if when she‚Äôs settled in her new job, to be able to see her again in that setting?  I don‚Äôt want to come over as desperate but just need some feedback on this subject, ‚ÄòLoss of your Psychologist‚Äô.
Thanks in advance for your advice and for reading!!

Hi all,
 
I am new here and thought i'd seek some support
 
My dog suddenly took a turn for the worst Friday just gone, she has had joint issues most of her life in which we were managing quiet well with medication. I went away for 3 weeks and left her with my friend she had a great time - 1 week in being back with me she was still doing great being her old self. She is 12 years old we have been to the after hours vet twice over the weekend and her regular vet twice due to her distressed, being uncomfortable, in pain and crying. She was given more pain relief and we thought after the first visit she would bounce back to herself..(normally she would) but she didn't - My regular vet opted to try laser therapy Saturday to see if that helped (of course i was eager to try anything to help ease the pain) and also to visit the pain clinic to look at Nerve Blocking (I did not want to put her through this due to having to redo the procedure every 3-6months if it actually worked) i weighed the pros/cons and came to the decision its not fair to put her through that, and the laser therapy would take time but it wasnt time that my doggy had but we still tried to atleast give a little comfort. On Sunday we went back to the vet (4th visit) and i was a complete mess crying. The vet agreed with me when i meantioned to put my girl to sleep and that was hard to get the words out (my head tells me dont do it! but my heart tells me its the right thing)  i cant have her suffer anymore, its not fair shes not getting better. all i can do now is try to keep her comfortable - today we went for another laser therapy session and i asked to book to put her to sleep tomorrow (Tuesday) that was really hard as all my emotion came out. Today i also took my girl to the beach one last time, gave her a plain sundae, potato and gravy (all her favourites!) but now, im just trying to comfort her and i just get emotional, im scared & im scared for tomorrow i dont know how i will cope - i have never experienced this before. i have my partner and hes been great, hes been in my girls life for 10years now so he's feeling the pain aswell. i know soon she will be at peace

Hi all,
My parents were both diagnosed with terminal cancer, we lost mum a month ago and now dad is back in palliative care.
im struggling so much with the loss of my beautiful mum and also having to revisit the hospital/ward she passed away on every day to see dad, as well as dads drastic decline in the last few months.
im not sure what I‚Äôm wanting from this, maybe hope that I can make it through and support to keep being strong. Every day is a struggle and I haven‚Äôt had time to process what has happened with mum in between caring for dad.

Hello 
im trying to grief for my mum who passed away June 2019 
I have to girls aged 4 & 2 and I have my supportive husband 
I really wanted to connected with anyone that is going through the same thing and help me through my dark days

So my stepdad died two and half years ago at aged 42 due to a cardiac arrest. He was a dad to me for 20 years and also a father to my two teenage brothers that are now aged 15 and 16. 
When he died I was 23 and I moved back home to support my mum and brothers and I did so for 9 months. I struggled coping with my own grief while supporting everyone else‚Äôs so I eventually moved to Canada (my mum is Canadian and all of her family is in Canada). My mum was very supportive of this decision and said that she just wants me to be happy. I met a Canadian man and we‚Äôve since moved home to Perth - we‚Äôve been back for almost a year now. My mum is still majorly depressed, not eating properly, barely sleeps, and feels very lonely and like she doesn‚Äôt have a support system.
I have dealt with anxiety and depression for years, and had a very complicated relationship with my stepdad for a very long time (however I still loved him with all my heart and his absence from my life still takes the breath out of me. I often have dreams about him and wake up hyperventilating and crying). My heart aches and I want to help my mum, but I also want to live my own life and it takes so much effort just to keep my own head above water. 
So my question is what should I be doing to help her? How much responsibility do I take on for her happiness and wellbeing? I have suggested psychologists many times and she refuses. She says she has too many issues that have been repressed for decades and she wouldn‚Äôt survive talking to someone about it. She did start seeing my kinesiologist after my stepdads death and it helps but only does so much. She also isn‚Äôt a very social person and because of this has very few friends. She‚Äôs also just been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes so she can‚Äôt eat so many of the things she loves which I know hasn‚Äôt helped. I hold so much guilt over not doing more for her but I‚Äôm constantly told by other loved ones in my life that it‚Äôs not my responsibility. That at some point she needs to pull herself out. I just don‚Äôt know.

Hi there
I lost my Mum to lung cancer Nov 19.
She had been told in September 19 following surgery Jul 18 that she had 5 years.
The surgery she had was for a different type of lung cancer. During the operation they cut her
Main artery and she lost 3 litres of blood and was lucky to survive.
Her recovery was slow and she developed a cough. She was put on antibiotics but unbeknown
she had developed small cell carcinoma which has a low survival rate.
She went in to hospital for a bronchoscopy to determine the cough and development
Of atrial fibrillation. I stayed with her for a test (3 day stay in hospital) and she died 9 days later.
Iam struggling as she was told in September she had 5 years as the op in July 19 was successful.
I was holding her hand when she died.
She was my best friend and was 75 and full of life.
I have no close friends (ai moved to Vic almost 3 years ago) so feel alone. 
I'm not sleeping and I focus on things I did wrong over the years rather than the
Good times.  I beat myself up.
I kept a small urn with some of Mum's ashes as she is interred in another  state.
I hold and kiss the urn daily. I feel I am in denial/shock. I MISS HER.

Three months ago my mum lost her battle with cancer. All my mum did for the 18 months that she was diagnosed, was talk about the fact she was dying. Every conversation surrounded death to the point that I tuned out to it and then when she did actually die, I couldn‚Äôt believe it. It‚Äôs like I became desensitised to her dying to the point where I didn‚Äôt actually believe she would. 

I coped ok for the first two months. Just did what I had to do. I was more angry than anything else. Then something inside me broke and now I have to take life hour by hour instead of day by day. I‚Äôm absolutely miserable. No energy. Showering feels like a massive task. 
have been to the gp and see a psychiatrist For medication. I‚Äôm currently trying a third medication but feel so so low so don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs helping. Psychiatrist wants me to stick it out another couple of weeks but surely it should have worked by now. I‚Äôve been on it around 6 weeks.  I‚Äôm miserable. So stuck in my own head with the circling thoughts of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point in life‚Äù ‚Äú why are we even here‚Äù. I wish there was an off switch. 
I have three kids, one being only 4 months old and I need to live and not be such a head case but I just can‚Äôt function. I barely leave the house these days. Maybe once or twice a week when I absolutely can‚Äôt avoid it. 
I‚Äôm so sick of feeling this way and I hate myself for it because I should have the power to turn it off and change but I just can‚Äôt.

Hi all

I'm new to this forum, and not really sure what to say. I'm just a bit lost and stuck and in a confused space of grief and loss.

I lost my partner to suicide 18 months ago. It was a surprise to us. Although she did have some problems in the past and, as I've learned to process since her passing, was a functioning alcoholic.

I've spent so much time making sense of things. Processing my sadness and guilt and trying to understand and forgive her... And now I feel like I've lost who she actually was before all this trauma. I'm not really sure how to extrapolate what I have been left with, while also appreciating our life that was. I don't recognise it any more. I am numb to my present. So am stuck. And sad. And sometimes really desperate. Sometimes I am happy. I do have lots of love around me. 

I feel like I have my head under water, and am content swimming beneath the surface because when I come up for air it's all too much and it makes my head spin.

I'm not sure what anyone could possibly say, and I'm not sure that there is anything to be said. I guess I just needed a forum and space to put my feelings into words. It's comforting to read the honest stories and supportive responses. There are a lot of brave people in the world and on this forum. It's inspiring.

Hi guys,
This is my first post on here so i am a little nervous and unsure. But yesterday i had a really bad accident and backed over my families new puppy. He was gone pretty much instantly. We had only had him less than 3 days and he basically stuck to my side every hour of the day. He was always following me around and would do everything i did. I had no idea he had gotten out of the house and followed me up to my car, and so when the accident happened i was just in complete shock and overwhelmed i had the worst panic attack i have ever experienced. I still feel so guilty and just in shock, i have no idea what to do or how to cope. I have suffered from anxiety for many years now, and have had a few depressive episodes but this feels like the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I know it was an accident and there was no way i could've known he was there. But i just, i don't know what to do and i don't know how to get past this pain. I know it is going to take time but i just feel so guilty and i cant stop seeing him just lying there. It hurts to know that he was only there because he wanted to be with me and next me.
 
Please help me know how to process this and recover from this.

Two years ago on the 30/11/2017 I received the call that my beautiful 25 year old daughter had died by suicide. I have three children and my daughter was my middle child. The life of the party, my biggest supporter and never a day went past that she didn‚Äôt tell me she loved me. I fought hard for justice for my child and was left to handle everything as my husband struggled to cope. As I fought for my child I also found out that my husband of 30 years was having an affair with a woman known to me. I overheard his drunken conversation to her as he was describing me as disgusting to look at and how wonderful she was. The next day I phoned him and he was with her on our new boat named after our daughter (they both laughed because she went on the boat before me). I spent over 8 hours that day begging him to come home. He agreed to counselling and trying to put our marriage back together. Nothing has changed, with him doing whatever he wants, relying heavily on alcohol and telling me to get over it. This is a man I loved. This is all too much and I struggle more and more to find reasons to go on. The woman I see in the mirror is disgusting. I went back to work, am studying and trying to like myself but I don‚Äôt know how much I can take. He refuses to sell the boat and when I go to my car it is the first thing I see. My other two children don‚Äôt want to talk about their sister and I continue to pretend I‚Äôm happy when I‚Äôm dying inside. My husband just things I‚Äôm a fool.

Today I am dealing with a overwhelming sense of sadness and guilt. 7 years ago my sister and I had a falling out over some issues related to her relationship with my parents. It was after being the person stuck in the middle of this constant fighting between them, I cut all ties with both of them for 12 months and didn't allow my children contact with either of them. At the time I said some pretty nasty things to both and felt a massive sense of relief. 1 year on I was able to repair the relationship with my parent but remainded estranged from my sister and then nephew who was 7 years old at the time. I loved my nephew, however I didn't want to engage with my sister which mnt I couldn't engage with him. Over the 7 years of separation I have attempted to repair te relationship with my sister on 5-6 occasions but phone or text and she has choosen to not respond. I've respect this and not pushed after the initial text or call. 1 week ago my nephew was successful in ending his life. I have felt nothing but sadness and loss at this and reached out to both his parents, to express my sorrow for them and also myself. Today my sister made contact with me and and said that I would be happy that my nephew had passed away and that how dare I make this about myself and text her 3 times. I feel guilty that I've made her grief worse and I've clearly misread the situation. I feel helpless and so bad.

I lost my mum 2 weeks ago tonight. Since her passing, I don't feel like I am present at some points during the day (if that makes sense?) I am so very fortunate I have had an amazing amount of support from close friends and family, but I feel like I am failing my family (husband & 3 young children) I am not sleeping well at all, my mind is constantly ticking and thinking of so many things, it just won't switch off. My husband has been more than incredible, but I feel so guilty that I am not helping him in the capacity that I usually do. I have this overwhelming sense that I have to be strong for my kids and that I must get on with life as the way it was vs then not having the time to adequately grieve the loss of my mother, who I loved so much. I am just so lost. I feel that I am overwhelmed with not being able to control my emotions the way in which I usually can. I am unsure as to what to do next? Should I seek medical advice re: not sleeping? Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

My mum passed away 7 weeks ago now. Although not completely unexpected as she was unwell, it was a shock at the time. My reaction has been so strange to me.
 The funeral was a wonderful gathering of family and we all supported each other and there were tears and lots of hugs and lots of love expressed. But now I cannot feel any emotions when I think of her loss.  It is as if I am numb. I don't understand this as I had a loving (but sometimes complex) relationship with her. And when I lost my dad I had a completely different experience of grief which felt more immediate. 
Two things have happened recently....I seem to be getting snappy with people whom I am close to. It is as if little things are triggering my temper and I am short and cranky. I can only assume this is related to my grief. I have not experienced this before. Has anyone else experienced something similar? 
The other thing is that my grief associated with another loss in my life (an estrangement from a close family member) seems to be dominating my thoughts and feelings. I feel this grief often, but since my mum died it seems as if it is so much more intense. It is as if I cannot grieve my mum as my loss of another is so dominant. Does this make sense? Is this possible that my grief for my loss of my mum is being overshadowed by grief of another? 
I really don't know how to understand all this and I certainly don't know how to feel about it all. 
Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated.

Hi guys, 
Today I release my brothers ashes into the sea over the cliffs where we released mum mums 2 years ago.. It seems so sad that my brother and I were there not long ago doing that together with my dad and now he won‚Äôt be there.. well not in real life.. it‚Äôs so soon to return there and now to release him.. he didn‚Äôt get over my mums death.. 
today it will just be myself and my dads girlfriend which is sad and not what I wanted.. esp the gf part.. dad moved on when mum was dying.. I had to battle to stop her coming to my mums ashes release.. but I have no fight left and if it makes him happy then I have to stop trying to be my mums advocate just like today I have to just be and not be my brothers.. except for making sure he got laid to rest with mum.. he chose not to be here anymore and died on the anniversary of her death..  it will be a hard day but hopefully I can find some will to live again after this instead of going through the motions.. just a shame it had to be at Xmas time..  anyways thanks for giving me a place to share.. my life was so different before all this loss...
thanks guys

I've been separated nearly two years from a man with PTSD and major depression.  Despite every opportunity to recover he seemed determined to destroy himself and everything around him. He wouldn't cooperate with doctors or treatment, blamed me and others for all his troubles and doggedly pursued a destructive lifestyle. In the last year we were together I couldn't shake the feeling that someone, somehow was going to die. I thought it would be me or the kids - his behaviour was just so appalling and reckless - but as it turns out he simply killed himself; a few months ago he was diagnosed with end stage liver disease. He won't have more than a few months. Here's the rub: Obviously he's sober now, and that makes a difference, but he's also coming back back to the man I used to love. Kind, funny, sweet and caring. It's like a weight has lifted off him and he's dropped his anger and hate and is just living for the moment. I drove him back from a medical appointment recently and we laughed, told stories and talked about the kids. Compare that to a few months ago when I refused to take him anywhere in the car out of fear he'd run us into a tree or under a truck - he was that bad. I don't love him anymore but God I feel sorry for him. If only he could have learned this lesson earlier, opened his heart and mind to recovery, he could have spared us all so much heartache. Right now he could have had family and friends around him to hold his hand and tell him they love him but he's lost it all. It's just so sad.

Hi this is my first post here. It was 2 years ago in September I lost my mum suddenly to lung cancer. She died 2 weeks after diagnosis. She was my best friend and the only person that really understood me. 2 years on and I still don‚Äôt cope at all not a week goes by I don‚Äôt breakdown crying. 
I have 2 young girls the youngest was 3 months old when she passed. I‚Äôve really struggled with my kids since she‚Äôs gone my mother gave us so much help and now that‚Äôs it‚Äôs gone I don‚Äôt know what to do she was our only help we don‚Äôt have much other support. I want to be a good mother but find it hard when I feel depressed alot. 
since she has been gone we have had family rifts I don‚Äôt speak to my brothers anymore and I have now lost some close friends. I feel at times I have no one left me and my husband barely talk anymore he was helpful in the beginning but now I feel my cry‚Äôs for help just go unnoticed. Feels like everyone thinks I should be over it by now but life is just getting worse not better. I know I need to seek some help but find it hard to ask I‚Äôve always just managed on my own.

Today I found the loss of my mum quite shit to say the least. I am in the process of getting treatment for depression which has been delayed due to insurance (hopefully approved next week!) but its been a hard slog and my mum passed in 2017, so the grief is still pretty raw. She was with me through past episodes of depression and just life in general and now that shes not is bloody hard. My psychologist doesn't think we should talk about my mum's death just yet until I try sort out my own stuff, I agree but maybe its time in the next few weeks.

Recently our much loved son, nephew, grandson, husband and father committed suicide.  It has been devastating and incomprehensible.  My family has been ripped apart and are attributing blame to each other at a time that we should all be comforting each other.  I sit at home every night and cry and drink.  Has anyone else suffered a lose like this and how did your family cope and help each other.  I am feeling so miserable and helpless - it's been three months and nothing is getting better.  I never thought my family would behave like this during such a sad time.

Hi all, 

I've had depression since I was 16 (25 now), my dad was my rock, the person I turned to after a horrible day and was my biggest cheerleader always. Sadly 4 months ago he had a trail bike accident and passed away. I remeber the day like it was yesturday, getting the call saying he had an accident thinking yep that my dare evil dad just being himself, waiting for the call to hear where the helicopter was taking him, laughing with my sister about how dad won't even wait to the cast is off before getting back on a bike. Almost an hour went by of me freaking out waiting to hear, then my partners phone rang it was one of the guys at the track with dad, he face said it all, I know my dad didn't make it. My dad had a brain aneurysm pop and died within mins.
It was the biggest shock of my life, I regret not going to the track and seeing what was taking soo long, for so long I thought dad would come around the corner and say hehe just kidding like one of this horrible jokes that have gone to far. 2 weeks after my dad passed away my boyfriend asked me to marry him, he told how the last time he talked to dad he asked for my hand in marriage. 
I'm really struggling trying to understand why?? 
Why did he have to go soo young?(aged 50)
He will never meet my kids or be at my wedding. I love my H2B but every time i get upset he tells me that he understand that he knows how it feels. Some time I want to yell at him and ask him how he knows what it feels like when you still have your dad. 
My depression is worse then ever and it's really effect my relationship.

I‚Äôm 18 years old and at the start of this year my mum died so very unexpectedly. It‚Äôs been 9 months without her and I can‚Äôt explain how much I miss her she was my best friend she always had a solution to every problem of mine and for some insane reason I keep thinking that she is going to come back and everything will go back to normal but it won‚Äôt. It hurts my heart physically hurts and I don‚Äôt know what to do to stop it, all I want is to just see her face and hear her voice and just hug her so tight. Just mum and I lived in a small house together, mum had been sick for few weeks prior but doctors just kept sending her home with different pills to take so she went to the hospital one night from still feeling unwell, I was happy because I thought that she would get the medical advice and treatment she needed and be home in a few days, that night I got a phone call asking if it was me and was told to come up to the hospital so I did. I got there and all the doctors kept saying to me was ‚ÄúHannah your mum is really sick and it looks like she might die‚Äù as I waited for the rest of my family to travel down to the hospital I sat by her bed side in the ICU unit and watched my mum die then had to tell the rest of my family when they got there. I keep reliving this day over and over in my head and I have dreams at night about it, it makes me feel sick and makes me feel so sad I just couldn‚Äôt do anything to help her. I don‚Äôt want to live my life with out my mum, I feel that I will never be properly happy again. I want her here with me it‚Äôs just so totally unfair. I don‚Äôt understand what I did to deserve this kind of pain. The last thing I thought that would happen this year was I wouldn‚Äôt be finishing it with my mumma, this year by far has been the worst year of my life and I cannot wait until it is over.

Late in 2018 I lost two family members very close to me. First, at the end of August someone who is like a second father, who has cared for me since I was 6 months old finally passed away after a long hard battle with cancer. I had received messages from my 'sister' days earlier telling me that his health was rapidly declining and that I should come visit him as they didn't know how long he had left. I was so busy with work shifts all over the place that it took a bit before I could organise a time, and I finally planned a day I would go and visit. A couple of nights before the day I had planned to visit, I get a phone call from my niece saying I should come urgently as he was getting even worse. I was prepared to head over there and then, but because it was late at night, we both agreed I would come early the next day. 
The next day, as I'm getting ready to head out there I get a phone call from my niece again... in tears telling me he was gone. I'd never experienced the death of someone so close, so I didn't know how to react and my instinct was to be the strong one, and I held it together, suppressing my emotions through everything so that everyone else had someone to lean on. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks, I had a holiday I had booked for months to go to Japan. But I don't look at that holiday as a good holiday. As the day after I returned home, my grandfather passed away. A little over a month after my 'Dad' had passed away. I had so much suppressed emotion from his passing that when I found out about my Poppy I broke. I was an emotional shell for months afterward, and I could not sleep.
I didn't catch up with my Poppy (grandfather) right before we left for Japan, even though he wanted to catch up for dinner the night before we went away. He rang me, but I was so busy packing and when I checked the message I had already eaten dinner. So I didn't ring him back even though I had spare time for going out with him, and told myself I would contact him when I get back. I never could. I still have the messages on my phone, saved, so that I could hear his voice. 
It's now been a little over a year since they both passed away and I still have dreams and nightmares. I still have so much grief and guilt about losing them both, I feel so guilty about all the times I didn't catch up with them and how distant I was. I don't know what I can do, but I've been so lost since. 
I have never experienced this, I don't know what I can do.

My grandfather who I am very close to has had an unfortunate decline in his health and we have been told to start making preparations. 
I previously have lost my father and my grandmother and was not able to handle grief very well at all. 
Can anyone recommend any books, resources etc to help prepare for grief and cope with loss?
 
Thank you in advance

It's 2.15am I sit here looking out the window once where my husband sat doing the same thing in March before he went into hospital for minor medical condition and did not come home.  Today at 10.00am I spread his ashes across my home and say my final goodbye and to gives us both peace and harmony.  I have not said my final goodbye to loved one in this manner before in my life so do not know what to expect when I open the urn to set him free!  I feel so numb with nothingness and feel my anxiety is bad as I have been extremely itchy on my palms of hand and scratch and scratched so much that I have scratched marks in my hands but with that at least I feel the pain.  I chose today as it is hubby's 60th birthday and have bought a bunch of rainbow roses that have scent in his memory of his great life!  Yesterday I was supposed to work a shift but clean forgot that I was rostered on.  I have never missed a day's work even due to depression or anxiety but I sit here with a smile on my face and think of his life and love.   RIP Bazza.

Hi,
My beautiful little girl was killed when a 100kg truck wheel fell on her almost 10 weeks ago.
I rushed my daughter to the local Hospital in a minute or so, but the blunt force trauma was too great for her to survive & approx 30 minutes later the ED team had to call it off as she was gone forever.
It has been almost impossible for me to work & think clearly but I need to try & continue my work so that I survive financially.
Only time will tell if I can stay afloat.
The negligent tenant who stacked the truck wheels against the outside shed wall appears to not care, feel any shame or embarrassment for his actions & has continued to attend & work on his junk in the next door storage shed whilst I'm trying to work. He has walked past me several times & acted as though I'm not even there. He has shown no remorse, given no apology for his actions & didn't even clean up the junk that he left lying around outside the storage shed until I put in a official complaint about his junkyard.
Everyday has been a roller coaster of emotions, my disbelief that my little girl is gone forever, my disbelief that someone could be so stupid to lean truck wheels against a shed wall unrestrained in a Public access walkway to the Toilets, Anger that this has happened to an innocent little girl that should have been safe & had walked to the Toilets many times without incident.
I just don't understand how this has happened & that nothing seems to be happening to punish the negligent party.
My 7yo girls life was cut short by the stupidity of a Truck Driver who had no excuse for his actions, He had plenty of time & plenty of available space to store the wheels safely but chose not to. I don't see that Justice will ever be served for his actions & it only hurts more when I'm told that my little princesses life is worthless under Australian law.
Time does not heal all wounds & whomever came Up with that lie has never lost someone that they truly, deeply love & care about.
This tragedy has only continued to grow in its abilty to break our family more as time goes on.
The problems that it causes multiply everyday & I know I will never get over this loss.

I have only just lost my mum and I'm feeling so empty, broken and sad sometimes I think about self-harm (I will not do this as I have two kids to live for). How do I try and get back to a normal life. I miss her so much.
",Grief

My 14 year old son took his life 2 years ago but I don‚Äôt believe it was suicide. I won‚Äôt go into detail but we found evidence he had been self-harming for sometime. The police didn‚Äôt look into this further and it was put down to suicide. So for almost two years this is what I‚Äôve had to try to accept even though there were no signs of depression and he was otherwise completely healthy, happy, confident and capable young man. But I just don‚Äôt accept it now. I have no way of proving it. And I don‚Äôt even know where to start to get any support. My partner is not convinced, but he is still in denial about everything and we can‚Äôt talk about it. The rest of the family, except my dad, all carry on as if it didn‚Äôt happen and it‚Äôs almost like my son never existed! I‚Äôm desperately miserable. I try to carry on but some days I just don‚Äôt see the point. Today is one of those days so I thought I better come here. Thanks for listening.

My mother died when I was 11 (many, many years ago) and my sister died 4 years ago. Both had long illnesses and suffered drawn-out deaths. For me, watching both of them die was very traumatic and for years I've had to deal with anxiety, depression and PTSD. Quite often though I feel like no one understands (except my therapist), so I guess I'm just reaching out to see if I really am alone in this or if there is anyone else who knows what a double loss feels like?

Hi everyone. 
I lost my mum to suicide a month ago, she tried to commit suicide when I was 35 weeks pregnant. 
Due to her drug use and mental health I made the hard decision for her to not meet my newborn child, one month ago my mother commited suicide. She left letters and basically blamed me and wrote that I was never going to let her be a grandmother.. I have so much guilt and regrets on not letting her meet my son. 
At the time of my decision I had the right intentions but now that she is gone I am struggling so much.
I am loosing focus while driving, I seem to not have any confidence I second guess my self a lot which is dangerous behind the wheel. 
I am not one to talk about my feelings I normally ""bottle it up"", but I know I am not okay. For my son's sake I want to get help, my dad is not around and I only have one sister left. 
My fiance and his family are a great support, I don't have many friends.. 

Has anyone been through this before? Have you lost confidence in driving and had bad anxiety in the car I am getting to the point where i do not want to drive and don't want to be in the car at all.
",Grief

I‚Äôm not really sure what to say or why I‚Äôm here. 
I‚Äôm struggling a lot. My boyfriend and I ended out three year relationship (amicably) on Sunday. We just weren‚Äôt the one for each other. Regardless he was my best friend and the one I always sought support and comfort from.  I left at 9pm Sunday night. 
9am Monday morning, 12 hours later, I took my precious 10 year old cat to the vet for a check up. I only recused her two months prior but she was a shining life changing beacon and lit up my whole life. 10 minutes into the appointment the vet told me she had aggressive cancer, was in significant pain and suffering, and there was nothing to be done for her. It was completely unexpected. I held her in my arms while she took her last breath and let her go that morning. 
I knew my boyfriend and I would break up that weekend. We had both planned it and wanted to spend quality time together to just enjoy the good parts before we went out separate ways. I had no idea my little cat was unwell and I would have to end her life that morning. It was 12 hours only after breaking up. It hurts because if it has been 12 hours earlier my best friend would have been there with me and comforted me and supported me through the grief. But we broke up so he‚Äôs not. I told him what had happened and he was sorry but didn‚Äôt want to be involved or change things. 
Im struggling ALOT to just function. Eating, drinking, using the toilet, sleeping, socialising, thinking. Life just seems completely and utterly impossible. 
I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends and don‚Äôt have family aside from my mum, who lives interstate. She‚Äôs helping as just as she can but I‚Äôm just so lost and feel alone in this grief.  I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm supposed to be grieving, my beautiful cat who was my family, or the loss of my relationship. 
I don‚Äôt really know what to expect here. Am i overreacting and being too dramatic?

Hi, my husband lost his mum to cancer last week and has had to travel to arrange her funeral. It was sudden and the plan was to return a week later but he has had to stay another week to next Thursday. I am feeling at a loss trying to cope with three children (7, 3 and 10m) at home without him. Very sleep deprived. I am feeling this abysmal pit in my stomach, anxiety and sheer panic that fills the emptiness of time. This happens every time my husband leaves me with the children and it harks back to a deep seated fear of being left behind on my own and I suspect it can be traced back to babyhood when my mother gave me away to my grandmother to care the first 9m of my life. At the moment, I find it impossible to fill the time between sleeps. I also don't know how to support my husband through his grief. When we spoke, he is also not coping. I feel like I am sinking into a pit of depression whilst also contemplating mortality. I knew my mil and my mum recently too completed chemo for cancer. I don't want to burden my husband further with my insecurities and these worries and anxieties as he has enough on his plate atm dealing with family and burial politics.

Autopsy doesn't show heart attack etc.  Workplace is not saying anything. At the moment we (myself and two adult children) are awaiting further results from the autopsy that was performed. Could understand if he had died a natural death but the unknown is killing me. It's been two weeks tomorrow and at the time we couldn't even see him for 6 days.  Don't know what to do. It is just an emotional rollercoaster. Legal, official, workplace, Worksafe (investigating). Just sucks big time at the moment.

This is my very first post in here so please bare with me.
1st September 2019 (Fathers Day) my Dad started planning his ending, he wrote multiple suicide letters, people saw him on the 2nd and the 3rd and said he seemed like his happy self, he sent my sister a Facebook message on the morning of the 4th, nothing that warranted concern. No contact after that but that wasn‚Äôt unusual.
7th September his body was discovered.
he lives back in New Zealand, I live in Perth, my sister dealt with everything.
for the first 10 days I felt numb, but I was holding on to the fact that his letter to me would give me some kind of understanding, some kind of closure?
the Police back there contacted me on day 10 to explain the process and to let me know all his suicide notes would be delivered to the correct people... also to inform me that I was NOT one of the people he chose to say goodbye to!
I am heartbroken beyond words that I didn‚Äôt mean enough for the goodbye he was able to give my sister and multiple other people.
I don‚Äôt know how to move on from this, closure seems impossible.

I wish I felt anything but anger when I see a pregnant woman, affectionately caressing the home in which her baby grows safely. Pain wears the veil of anger so as not to be seen. It buries itself deep in the heart of me where it is safe from the eyes of others. I feel my stomach fall and hot tears prickle my eyes. They are cautious; refusing to fall and expose the pain. Anger surfaces in its place. Who can wear this anger for me? Who can take it off my hands and lessen the load? There is no one to give my anger to. I sit here and wear it, wishing it wasn't mine. I run my hands over my broken and battered body; the body that couldn't make a home for the babies I loved. Loss after loss after loss. My body fails again. Silent rooms and empty ultrasounds plague my mind. Rivers of unforgiving crimson rush from my body and tell me it's over. With them, they take a part of my soul never to be returned to me. Sterile white walls of hospitals become witness to the deepest pain I've ever known. I don't think I can get up again. The pain is just too much to carry. Am I being punished for being home to depression? Can you not be home to the deepest sorrow and the most exhilarating love at the same time? Is there someone out there who would have loved harder and laughed more often? Does she get to wake with hope each day instead of crippling fear? Would that make her a better mother? It doesn't seem fair. I know I can walk alongside my depression and love fiercely at the same time. I have all my life. So what makes this different? Do I not deserve to feel the depth of this love? Families grow around me one by one. Babies are born and lives are changed. And still I sit here as anger masks the pain I don't want seen. The world shifts and changes around me and I'm stuck; unmoved. I smile as friends share their news and allow the tears to fall freely in private. I question how I will live through pain that feels so permanent and unchanging. And while it feels impossible and beyond my capacity; I do it. I walk through the rawness of the pain and continue to live. I have thought I shouldn't be alive because of my broken body and hateful mind. And yet I am here living. Instead of the pain making me wish I could leave, I now know how to carry it and live alongside it. But as I sit here in the cafe watching the expectant mother caress her stomach with loving anticipation I wish I felt anything but anger.

I'm in year 7 and yesterday I suddenly lost my mother due to a heart attack. It had been very sudden as she had been fine the day before.
it is so hard to cope with, my mum was the only person I trusted and now she will never get to see me grow up and graduate school, we had so many plans made for life including an amazing road trip visiting one of the places she had always wanted to visit.
i can't stand to think that she will never be back, she will never get to know her grandchildren. My children will never ever meet there grandma 
My mum, she was so beautiful, so kind and nice and was always there to greet me when I got home from school, she was so supportive in helping me in my first year of high school

My partner and father of my 2 children of over 15 years passed away 14 years ago. I never got the time to grieve for him as my children were young and I had no time to fall in a heap so just kept on going on. But on the 14th year of him passing I'm finding myself starting the grieving process. I don't know what to do or how to feel or how to get through it. I have happily moved on and married to a wonderful man but  finding myself crying and not being able to control the tears when they flow. Any answers on how to get through this would be grateful. I have made an appointment with my doctor to talk to him about it. I have cried my heart out to my husband, he wants to help but doesn't know how. Any help would be appreciated. Thanku

My Nan had a massive Stroke around 2 months ago that took basically the whole right side of her brain. She was a fit and healthy 83 year old woman. She is paralyzed on her left side and can no longer speak and they did not expect her to survive the Acute phase, but she did and made it all the way to rehab. In the last few days she has been switched to Palliative care and will be gone within the next week. I am absolutely devastated. She is my best friend and like a mother to me. I love her so dearly, I am just  completely heart broken. I am going to see her every day, but watching her deteriorating is cruel. She is the most kind, selfless and beautiful person I have ever met. She does not deserve to die like this. I want to wake up from this nightmare. When she had the stroke, I grieved knowing I would never hear her voice again and would never see her return to what she was. Now I am sick to my stomach knowing for the first time in the 23 years I've been alive, she will not be there for Christmas or my next birthday. I will never hear her voice again, or hold her hand, I will never get anpther hug or kiss and she doesn't get to watch my daughter grow. She is also leaving behind her husband of over 6 decades. I don't know how to cope with the pain. It comes in waves and it is unbearable. I don't want her to go, I am cherishing the time I have left with her, but it is not enough. I am studying full time and starting a new job on Monday, I don't know how to cope with all of this. I just want her to stay with me.

I am struggling with severe anxiety and get so overwhelmed with constant thoughts of how terrible and disturbing the last days were before mum died at home, that the room starts spinning and i literally fall on the floor sobbing and cant stop.. its been 2 months and i just feel worse and worse, i think the palliative care team do a wonderful job but they really didn‚Äôt prepare me for how - i hate to use these words - gruesome and disturbing the last days could be. I feel like its a taboo subject that no one wants to talk about the days before and how the actual death are, its certainly not like you see it in the movies. I am trying to find someone to talk to about the palliative care experience. It all feels like a nightmare that i cant wake up from

I am just finishing my Certificate IV in bereavement support and my idea of doing this course was to be of help and an inspiration to those suffering grief in some way or the other either through the loss of someone or something they held dear to them.
Having lost my son aged seven years in an accident  a long time back I went through a lot of pain anxiety depression and lived with it silently for many years  i could never share with anyone my feelings and panic attacks fear uncertainty I really could not do the things I wanted to do I took me a long time to get over this not even anti depressants could help it was only my will power and my spiritual life that I was able to find my way through it all and after years of struggling with anxiety fear and emotional problems withdrawal physical problems caused due to emotions headaches etc. I now can confidentally say I have made it through and am strong bold and courageous I can face the world .
 
It is with this determination I am now completing my course so that I can be of help to those battling anxiety depression and suicide and give them hope for the future and teach them how to overcome these emotional problems and enjoy life to its fullest and as long as there is life there is hope.

It‚Äôs Fathers Day and it has been the first Father‚Äôs Day I haven‚Äôt been able to spend with my dad. 
he committed suicide just before Christmas, with no warning signs. My whole life I never knew what he was dealing with by himself.
thats the part that hurts the most, I‚Äôm more angry at myself that I never knew, never considered, how selfish of me! 
He left without one last phone call, nothing. And we are left with no closure, I keep reading this letter he wrote over and over and it brings me nothing but confusion. 
He was meant to walk me down the isle in a couple of months. I had just had my second child, he adored his grand children. I don‚Äôt understand how he could just leave us like this.

5 months later my own Dad passed away he had lived with my children and I for 11 years. Dad and I were close I supported him when we lost mum 12 years ago and done everything in my power to make his last years here as easy and as comfortable as I possibly could. My children aren‚Äôt coping with their grief one can‚Äôt find a job the other struggles to attend school each day, home just feels like a shattered mess where we just tolerate each other.

Hey everyone,
I‚Äôve just joined this community and thought it was time that I try and reach out or open up about my emotions.
18 years ago I was born a triplet. One of my sisters passed away months later as a result of being premature and having a bad heart. In that process, my Dad was told that I should‚Äôve died, I wasn‚Äôt breathing and was in an induced coma. Honestly, the guilt I feel is earth shattering when I think of her passing on but not me.
Then, 2 years go by and we learn that my Dad has cancer, more specially melanoma. He had numerous melanomas pop up around his body which killed him by the time I was 4.
When I was about 7 my nan had passed away from cancer too.
Prior to being born, 2 of my grandparents were already passed.
I‚Äôm 18 and have been feeling their losses significantly every minute, especially in the last couple of years. I can‚Äôt escape it. It‚Äôs as if I hadn‚Äôt dealt with it until now. I find it hard to not think about these days. I find it difficult to not feel guilty. I find it tremendously difficult to feel some type of happiness. I‚Äôm at quite a low point of my life, if I‚Äôm completely honest. I thought I may as well try and reach out on here before it becomes too much.
I have my sister and mum left but any other family members i have had left our family for numerous reasons. I guess I‚Äôm just trying to find a way to not feel so alone, so dark and empty.
If anyone has any advise or feels similar, please let me know.
Thank you for taking the time to read this, I appreciate it greatly.

I posted a couple days ago about the slim chances of my father surviving a battle with cancer and liver problems, unfortunately we lost him yesterday morning.. and it's the most painful thing i've ever felt in my life I feel so completely lost and distraught without him.. he did everything for me and my mother and brother and sister, my mother and I especially. I'm 24 still living at home and have terrible social anxiety so he has always done everything for me.. whether it be just going into a shop to get something for me when I cant or coming to doctors appointments and setting them up for me, ontop of that he looked after my mother who has MS. He was everything to us, the most selfless caring beautiful man and now he's just gone.. my memories are all foggy and I keep trying to remember the good things but alot of the time i remember him and his face when he was in his hospital bed. I want to hug him so tightly and apologize for not appreciating him as much as I should have but I cant.. I just want to hear his voice or his laugh.. I don't get how to move on from this, I miss him so so so much. My mother is so hurt too, she's in a nursing home 40 minutes away until we can get her closer and i'm just in the house alone with all dads things and these memories and I just don't know how to cope.. 
I wrote out a letter and had my aunt read it to him next to me telling him some things i'm glad I got across but his eyes were opening a little and closing all throughout it, i'm not sure whether he heard it because he was so so out of it but god i hope he did. 
You really realize how much you take your parents for granted when they're gone :(

I lost my younger brother who was too young to die. I am in Australia and he lived abroad. I had recurred brain cancer, radiotherapy and chemotherapy didn't help. He was struggling numbness on half of his body. He was expecting help. I googled to find alternative options where I came across to restricted ketogenic diet. I suggested him to try this and he went to that diet, we hired a dietitian. After two month MRI was clear and he felt improvement. We don't know if it was from the therapies or from the diet. He continued to work keeping the diet although it was hard. After two month, he felt strong numbness on half of his body. He went to doctor, doctors could do a surgery but there is a big risk that may be paralyzed or die. We refused surgery, but during 1 week in hospital his health deteriorated, was struggling to walk. But he said, brother I will keep the diet, not going for surgery. I was still in Australia organizing my trip back to home. I was seeking a doctor who can help him, found one in India. When I arrived he was already paralyzed, having difficulty to talk and sleeping a lot. I was too late, he was going to die soon. I talked a neurosurgeon in the capital, he asked to bring him. We brought him to hospital, stayed for 3 days, and they said they can't operate him anymore. Unfortunately, every time we visit hospital his health was going back more faster than at home, I can't understand. Traditional treatment wasn't helping him. Doctors said he is going to die in couple of days. They sent us back home. I googled again and found a doctor who treats patients with herbals. She gave some herbals which they may help. I refused drugs that doctors prescribed, because wasn't helping. Herbals looked like helping for some days, we saw a bit improvement. After ten days he experienced strong epilepsy when my mum and brother's wife was looking after. They couldn't help, it time before my another brother arrived and help. When I arrived doctors were to help. We took him to local hospital, he spent another 10 days with resuscitation. I cannot forgive myself, because keto diet didn't help but might progressed tumor. I cannot forgive myself coming home late to bring him to India, which might prolong his life. I can't forgive myself for refusing drugs doctors prescribed which might prevent epilepsy. I can't forget days he was expecting help, struggling from pain, couldn't speak last words because of resuscitation but hearing us telling lies that he will be fine.

Hi I‚Äôm a 32 year old single mum with two boys,8 and 2. Been in the Gold Coast for almost two years but lost my brother to suicide just after I moved up and have struggled to come to terms with. I have hardly been out of the house and have not made any friends here. The longer I am stuck in this rut the harder it is to pull myself out of it.

Hi there, have been very good since the past couple of posts. Just the past couple of weeks have gotten me down really bad. My grandfather has recently just passed from lung cancer he was a very big father figure in my life and my Grandmother who has been a very big mother figure has been diagnosed brain cancer again. But I've just started dating a girl who we both get along very well and after 4 months I couldn't be any happier. But since my grandfather's funeral I've been really anxious and sad. My mind seems to be melting because I feel like me being anxious all of the time is jeprodising my relationship with my girlfriend. I love her and care about her in every way but I feel like me being sad and anxious is making me critical with things like ""shes a really annoying today"" when before my Grandfather passed I could tolerate alot of that. I would never want to leave her, whenever I do think about doing that I feel really sad for her and myself like it would be torture for me to do that. I mean I'm always on edge and everything seems all to much. I love her and id do anything to be with her but sometimes it's all to much for me I don't really like the fairy tale stuff where it's like "" if she's the right one she'll make you feel happy 24/7"". I'm not a big fan of that. I guess my question is mostly is this a normal side effect in starting up relationships in my situation. Because I feel like I'm really alone in my thoughts and I can't tell anyone without upsetting someone.

Lost my dad on new years day to dementia. He gave up about a month beforehand and just stopped eating and drinking. He come good again and then refused all foods and fluids again before he passed. He suffered before he died. I didnt make it to his side in time. I feel regret over this. He was in a nursing home and he always said to me to never put in him care, which I  feel regret about. The home was wonderful to dad, I cannot fault the care that they gave him. I do miss him terribly.

I lost my grandpa just over a year ago and I‚Äôm not taking it very well. We weren‚Äôt that close and that‚Äôs the thing that bothers me. I feel like I should have done more to try and get closer to him and to have a better relationship. It was hard though because he lived three hours away so I could only really call him but still I didn‚Äôt even do that. My dad is taking it hard as well because it was his dad and I just guess I‚Äôm feeling really guilty and wish that I could‚Äôve done more to be closer. 
My grandma passed away 3 years ago and she died of cancer. She died because she didn‚Äôt want to have chemo because she didn‚Äôt want her hair to fall out. I wish I could have talked her into having chemo she maybe she might still be alive today. And I also feel the same way with her as my grandpa. I just wish I could have called them more and told them I loved them and gotten to know them as people more. It was hard because my parents didn‚Äôt want to drive up there so I didn‚Äôt have a super close bond with them. We only really saw them on special occasions like Christmas or Easter and still that wasn‚Äôt enough. I just miss them and wish I could talk to them again. Recently their house sold and I guess that just made me finally realize how real it is that they‚Äôre gone and that I‚Äôll never be able to see them again or talk to them. I went up and packed away their things and I just started balling and I guess the realization that we are never going to see them and that I didn‚Äôt even get to tell them I loved them one last time hit me. I would never get to hug them or play cards with them or anything ever again. It just makes me sad whenever I think about them and I try not to but every day I just get this feeling of guilt that I should have done more but I know I can‚Äôt. 
i miss them so much :‚Äô(

Dear Forum,
We lost our 29 year old son due to suicide one month ago. My internal clock stopped then. If you asked me the date I calculate it from the time he died. Outwardly I look to others like I am amazing - back at work, went to a conference last week. Internally, I am an absolute mess, foggy, teary, and really wanting to be left alone except my husband. I do have an incredibly understanding husband and a psychiatrist.  
We don't want to share the details of our son's death, except with medical professionals and a very close inner family circle. I don't want to be re traumatised by retelling the story and don't want to be defined as the mother as son committed suicide in a horrendous manner. We want to control the narrative. That is 'he has been ill for some years and his death was sudden and we are all very sad?' Is this OK? 
All that is important is my son is  no longer with us and my heat is bleeding. Any suggestions for immediate ideas or actions from those who have been in this situation on how to cope over the next few weeks?

Hi, my names Wade, im 29 and i have a 5 year old son. This year has shaken our world and changed the outcomes of our lives.
In March, we lost our rock, our guide, the third piece of our family jigsaw puzzle. My partner of 10 years, my sons mother, passed away due to a sudden asthma attack at our family house.
Unable to help, and having to watch it all take place is a realm i wish no one enters.
Whats even worse, the paramedics came, before her fatal cardiac arrest, and mistreated my girl, because she was only 25 years old, fit and healthy in every other way, the paramedics assumed a panic attack and made her walk! to an elevator and down 6 stairs, even though she begged them not to move her, even though she told them 'i feel like i will die if you move me'
clearly if you cannot breathe, your going to panic right? this i will never understand.
The paramedics had all the information in front of them, they knew they were there for asthma, yet while inside they took no vital observations, did not monitor the heart, or even use a stethoscope. The assumption of a panic attack was made within the first minute of speaking with her, and that choice to move her without observations was fatal.
I am currently going threw investigations with the QAS and Health Ombudsman , which will prolong my experience even further.
I want to warn you all with loved ones with asthma. Asthmatics get good at living with their condition, so good they can hide and mask how bad they really are. My girl was an expert at this, and when the paramedics arrived she was able to converse in full sentences without a wheeze, this is 10 minutes before a cardiac arrest.
First assessment no one would no she had asthma, even though she said she was worried about it and wanted it checked up, but they didn't want that, they wanted her to walk to the ambulance so they could get her to hospital in case it was to progress.
Seems fair, but the moment she stood up, tears ran down her face and she knew it was not right, and begged for them to help her.
Arrogant young paramedics kept telling her to calm down, your asthma is fine there no wheeze, your just having a panic attack.
The way i see this, if she was 80 years old, and she said she feels like she will die, they would not have moved her.

The asthma was there, and always the concern, but had the paramedics spent a bit of time and done an examination, they wouldnt have moved her, and maybe avoiding the arrest.

Hello, nearly exactly one year ago the father of our daughter, who will be turning 6 in September, took his own life. We were not together as a couple for around 2 years leading up to his suicide as he became agitated and frustrated and threatened my safety and my daughters. 2 months leading up to his death we had a massive argument which lead me to seek legal advice after a violent outburst in front of our daughter/ smashing my phone (not the first phone he had smashed) but our daughter was older and understood and still to this day brings it up. I never wanted things to end like they did as I loved him so much/ I just feel like I pushed him too hard and he couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. I still can‚Äôt make piece with the fact that he was so desperate he killed himself and left behind his family and friends but most of all his beautiful daughter. I cry so much as I‚Äôm so overwhelmed/ I work full time, raise or daughter by myself, run a household and take care of me too/ I feel like breaking most days.... I do have a great support network and I do reach out when I feel I need help with practical things but the grieving isn‚Äôt over for me. I do have a psychologist for both myself and my daughter, I wish I could talk more to my family friends though. It feels as if a time frame has been put on my grieving and I still feel like I haven‚Äôt even began.....

Hello all,
Im 28 years old and I‚Äôve lost both my parents. I lost my dad to cancer in 2010 and then my mum to suicide in 2017. I had a great relationship with both my parents and mostly with my mum who was my best friend. My mum had bipolar. Despite this she was an amazing mum and did so much for me and my siblings. I am yet to have children or get married but I have an amazing partner who I plan to do both with over the coming years. I understand why my mum suicided. But knowing why doesn‚Äôt really bring me much comfort. I feel empty and lost. I miss both my parents terribly and even though it‚Äôs been 9 years since I lost my dad and 2 years since I lost my mum the pain is still so raw. I have times where I feel really positive and excited for life but then I have real down times where I don‚Äôt feel anything and I shut off from my friends and the world. I‚Äôm on medication to help my anxiety which I‚Äôve suffered with for a long time. It got really bad about a year after losing my mum and I decided I needed help. It helped lots but I feel like I‚Äôm back at that place. I‚Äôve deleted all social media and I‚Äôm avoiding the world and hiding away like I don‚Äôt exist. Do you ever ask yourself why you....why has this happened to me...it‚Äôs unfair! I just need to know other people feel the same way as me and understand this empty feeling I have inside me. Thanks for listening! Xx

Tomorrow another year to remember my lovely gentle soul mother who would have been 98 this year. She had the most gentle kind nature and I am proud to call her mum, friend, ally and more. She was the world to me and miss her. It will be 4 years in July exactly 5 days after my birthday and though time fades, never my memory of her.
She always supported me through my days before I got diagnosed with major depression. All the ups and downs she remained true. I am truly thankful for my 4.9 (no. 5' tall mum would insist. ha ha) tall mum. How I enjoyed our outings together, our sense of humour and the love she gave me. Thank you mum for all the good times.  I remember when I got angry, she would say talk it out as its better to have an empty house than a bad tenant - meaning don't let all the anger stay inside. I will visit the cemetery and have my memories and remember.  Enjoy your mothers every day not just one day a year. Life is too short. Will be glad when I can join her someday.

My gorgeouse niece left us yesterday, she died in her fathers arms. I have taken care of her full time since she was released from NICU in Janauary. She basically was my daughter, even my sister, her mum, said this is so. They had to call the Ambulance on me as I triggered a anxiety attack that put me into shock. I could hear and see everyone but couldn't communicate. Everyone's worried about me but all I keep thinking about is my beautiful niece. 

I cannot sleep, I've surrounded myself with her clothes and toys and just piled them on me. I have all her stuff throughout my house. My car has her childseat. I'm broken. I don't know if I'm strong enough to not slip back into full blown depression and anxiety again. 

Seeing my other new born niece today and holding her I just kept thinking of how my other niece would hold my fingers like that and how I would look into her eyes. 


Please someone just talk to me.

I'd like to share my recent experience with a blighted ovum. I haven't been able to find much online support so thought i would share here in the hopes of talking to others.

Like alot of people, i had never heard of a blighted ovum before. I started to love my baby and get excited and plan for the future like most women do when they get that first positive test. But to find out at 6 weeks that there was no baby growing, but having all the symptoms of pregnancy, to then have to go through the process of a miscarriage, was traumatic for me to say the least.

It put alot of pressure on my relationship too as my husband and i came to terms with what was happening. We didn't handle it well which added to the pressure and sadness.

It is such a difficult thing to go through and im finding there is really no support for women like us. 

I know i am not alone in this experience and would love advice on moving forward.

Hi, Don't know really where to start or what to say. But I guess my current struggles are with losing my Dad a couple of months ago to cancer.  My Dad is my hero. Like most girls Dad's are. When my Dad got really sick and we knew we only had a few months left with him, I moved home to help my Mum care for him and to spend as much time with him as I could. But that entire month I was there, it was so hard as I watching my hero deteriorate. I watched him take his last breath and sat with him and told him how much I loved him. I just miss him. Miss him more and more every day. I feel like since losing him I have lost my will, strength and determination. All the things he instilled in us as kids. I have no drive at work, I keep making mistakes in life and I am so angry at the world. Something little will set me off and then I feel embarrassed for my going crazy and yelling at people. I feel like a failure all the time and that I'm just a crappy human. I just feel really lost and if he was alive I'd be letting him down with how I am acting. He wouldn't be proud of me and that makes me more upset.

My mum suffered from severe depression and bi polar disorder . 
I always thought she was going to get better but after a 15 year struggle and after us kids trying everything to help , she took her own life at the age of 61. 
Her later life was one of utter suffering everyday she lived in loneliness and isolation . We would visit as often as we could but Mum was Usually very intoxicated on prescription medication and alcohol.
This is the lady that cared for me when I was young , she did love me but she had been taken . 
I tried so hard in the hope that Mum would get better but it was not to be . I look into the eyes of my boy who was born 2 months after my mum died and know that Mum would have loved him . 
The feeling now without her is sadness at the level of suffering and loneliness she went through every day . 
When death came she was alone , she would have been so  scared ..

Hi everyone,
I had a miscarriage 12 months ago - I‚Äôm 40 years old. It‚Äôs turned me into a completely different person! I‚Äôm always angry, so angry. It‚Äôs turned me off any kind of intimacy with my husband  and I just feel down and angry all the time. As the months go on I get more angry as I realize i am further away from having another child - time is not on my side plus I‚Äôm tired all the time.  My daughter is 3 but I really wanted a second child.
I‚Äôve been grappling with the idea that perhaps a bit of depression is creeping in......... should I go and see a GP?

Hi i am new here. I am recovering from a breakdown, hoping someone else understands and has advice. The last 3 years has been too much and i broke. Losing the 2 people who meant the most to me plus my dog, grief, sadness, disappointment took over and i ended up in a black hole. I have improved somewhat but finding a new set of challenges. Now im just losing friends coz i dont meet their expectations. They offer help in the form of information and if i dont do what theyre suggesting, then it looks like i dont care. Im always misunderstood when someone is upset with me. You know what i mean? Like i really want to be like this. My body and mind are slowly recovering but it takes time. I have had major physical symptoms to the point of thinking i was dying and its all from stress. I would like to be whole again and im getting there but losing jobs and people along the way. Everytime this happens, depression gets worse and i withdraw again. Where has my fight gone, motivation?  I am sick of being judged when i dont go out of my way to hurt people, just doing the best i can. Its not a lot, better than last year and its something, baby steps. People dont get it and i feel like an island.

Hi, I haven't posted for a while,my son had 75% 3rd degree burns and suffering all manner of problems. We went out bush off grid for a while and my son appeared to be getting better. He still had his moments,though. I'd gotten him off all pain killers except panadeine forte, and all other meds except anti depressants and mood stabilizers. There was light at the end of the tunnel {and it wasn't the train}, until Sept 21 when he'd gone to town for the day,and was hitch hiking home that night when he was hit by a car and killed. We are so devastated, and finding it hard to get on with life...although I know he's not in any more pain now, I miss him so much.

On the third of April my father who I was extremely close to committed suicide, with no signs or goodbye.. I'm shattered  I need my dad. üò≠
I'm so angry not at him but at myself for not sensing it, how did I not realise. 
I still don't quite believe he is gone, and I don't want to believe it I don't want it to feel real. I'm scared i just need to talk to him, I need him. 
I'm 21 with a 1 year old and I can't help but loose it after trying to keep it together infront of her and I'm scared I'm damaging her by crying and yelling infront of her, and that I'm going to ruin her life by doing so so then I get angry and feel guilty for that too as well as feeling that I'd be disappointing my dad aswell because he believed I was an amazing mum. I don't know what to do or how to cope, I feel so empty, numb, broken, in shock, heart broken. 
I can't help but feel I wasn't enough and I'm angry at myself for that, why would he leave meüò≠

Hi. This is my very first post. 
On Wednesday (12/6/19) I got a phone call that my perfectly healthy Mother who was 58 had died. 
I had seen her the evening prior , my son and I often visit 2-3times a week after school pick up. And 2 days a week she would pick up/drop of my son at school. 
She seemed fine. Happy. Making jokes with me. 
 
That at night she went to bed and didn‚Äôt wake up. 
i am absolutely devastated , I can‚Äôt get the memory of that day out of my head. The picture of her lying in her bed, looking like she was just still sleeping, won‚Äôt leave. 
Im scared to go to sleep. Im scared I won‚Äôt wake up or I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll replay it again. 
Im scared I‚Äôll forget all my memories and I‚Äôm scared my children will forget her. 
i feel so much sadness that I didn‚Äôt hug her goodbye on the Tuesday night and I didn‚Äôt tell her I loved her enough. 
im finding myself going in waves. One moment I feel okay. I can accept it then the next I just wish I could rewind the clock and somehow stop it? I‚Äôll be fine. Then I‚Äôll cry. Then laugh. Then cry. 
i don‚Äôt know how to deal, what am I meant to do? 
How can I make sure I don‚Äôt forget anything? And how do I make the feeling of loss go away? 
 
I have  two children who absolutely adored their grandma and they are dealing with this so much  better than I.

In my 40th year, I finally found the courage to speak my truth and report my Childhood Sexual abuse from the ages of 6- 13 years old, perpetrated by my stepfather. I grew up in a very large extended family. My mother had 4 sisters all married with children, so a large group of cousins and we were all very close. 
My relationship at around my 40's, with most of my family including my mother and 2 step brothers (born after my abuse) was extremely strained, to say the least. One of the biggest factors contributing to this breakdown was that my mother initially believed me when I finally told her when I was 15. She left my abuser, then apparently did a backflip after attending counselling sessions together. 
In those sessions in the mid 80's, he admitted the abuse to the Department of Families and Communities investigators and used a recent stint in jail for Heroin Possession as his reason. The department deemed me no longer at risk of the abuse as I was living out of home by then in various squat houses, on the streets and couch surfing, emergency accommodation, Juvenile lock up. Basically anywhere away from my abuser was apparently deemed safer.  My mother spent around 6 months apart from him before asking me to allow her to go back to him and then stayed for another 18 years and had 2 kids to him. 
For the next 3- 4 years I really tried to live with my abuser in my life to keep the peace as he was still with my mother. At 17, I was pregnant with a child I was determined to keep. At 18yrs old, I had my daughter and my boundaries became very tight. I started pushing back on my mothers lie to live in denial. She never wanted to mention the abuse again and the rug she kept shoving stuff under was getting a really big bulge under it. 
I haven't spoken to my mother since 2010, next year it will be 10 years of no contact. From the snippets I have heard over the years, my mother has told my family that my abuse report to Police was a lie and I was only out to get money.  My blood family not contacted me since my report and subsequent 5yr court battle until recently one of my cousins I was close to growing up called me and told me never to contact him again as he had to protect his children from people like me. I know that says more about him than it does about me, but man it still cuts deep and really hurts your heart. 
Day to Day now its not so bad, it shifts, if that makes sense? Id love to connect with others in this boat, How do you manage your estrangement?

7 weeks ago I lost my husband
after he had battled with cancer for 2 years.  8 years ago we moved to Australia to start a new life and join my
daughter and family.   My son also
intended emigrating here so it seemed the right thing to do.  Before she emigrated here my daughter said
she only wanted to do it if we and her brother could also come and so we
developed a grand plan for us all to be together and join my brother and his
family here.
After we had already moved
here as our first granddaughter was due, my son changed his mind and accepted a
job in the Netherlands.   After we had
been here 4 years my daughter and son-in-law moved abroad.  They returned after 2 years but moved to the
other side of the country to a remote area, 5,000 kms away.   I am now here alone, (my brother and family
are here but they have busy lives) and I feel that I have been abandoned and
betrayed by my children.  Life is not how
we imagined it would be when we decided to come to Australia.   I know your children have their own lives
but my daughter is the one who wanted us to come here.
I feel very alone and cry
every day for my husband and can‚Äôt believe that this is my life now and my
future has been taken away.  It‚Äôs so hard
being in this house living with an empty space where my husband should be.  Most days I wonder what is the point of
getting out of bed.  My instinct tells me
to go home to the UK, as I was always quite homesick and only came here for the
family and my grandchildren, but I don‚Äôt know if I could start again at age 69 my
and then I would probably not see my grandchildren .

I had a miscarriage over a week ago, and where all the love and hope I had for my baby was, there's just emptiness. My chest has been literally aching with grief. I go from feeling sad to feeling angry to feeling numb. Unlike loss of a family member or friend who made it into the world, it just feels taboo and confronting to talk about for others, and I feel like I am very isolated. Out of the people who I have spoken to about the loss, a few have been great, but a few have been insensitive, have tried to move the conversation on as quickly as possible, or have just not known how to react and withdrew support altogether. My boss told me she was sorry to hear, but then basically told me that I'm not the only one going through things at the moment. I felt invalidated. My husband has gone through the loss too. He's only gotten overwhelming support from those he's told, and he is feeling positive about the future and focusing on wanting another pregnancy. I am feeling anxious about the future, and terrified it's going to happen again. On top of problems already going on at work, I feel like I'm drowning now in stress and grief, and it's getting harder to catch a breath.

Hello all, 
My father passed away last year and he was an alcoholic, which was a major factor that caused his death. I drink socially and have never had any problems in the way of addiction or being irresponsible. Since my father's passing, I have chosen not to drink as much when I'm out but on some occasions where I have had a couple (as we all do), these feelings of guilt present. I get quite upset with myself and I feel bad that I'm drinking and that I have let myself go beyond my limits. I don't know whether it's because I don't want to end up making the mistakes my dad did or because I know that alcohol was part of the reason he died. I know I shouldn't let his mistakes affect my life but in the back of my mind something triggers this. I didn't have much to do with my dad for a couple of years because of alcoholism and other issues that stemmed from it so it's not like I think he will be disappointed in me. The grieving process has been a roller coaster but overall I feel okay, I have moved on and accepted what has happened, I just can't seem to shake this feeling. I hope this makes sense. 
Thank you for any insights you may have on this.

Please accept my apologies for the new thread below, as I am a new member and attempting to put my emotions in words is difficult for me. I know I am not alone experiencing this huge battle to get over the loss of a loved one. I am hoping someone may be or have been through similar circumstances.
 My wife and best friend of 49 years passed away from Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer on Anzac Day. We knew this day was coming for nearly 4 years from the time of her diagnosis. We have been told she had the Cancer at least 3 years before diagnosis.
My wife and I accepted the diagnosis reasonably well and planned what we would do in between her treatment, while our medical team did everything they could and succeeded to give us 4 extra years together. 
I went to all my wife‚Äôs  appointments and treatments to give support. For the last year she found it difficult to get around which was devastating her as the pain was excruciating, but you would not have known. My wife always wanted to pass away at home and to facilitate this my two adult children, my wife‚Äôs sister and I looked after her at home during the last four days of her life.
I thought we had planned for this event, but nothing has prepared me for the depth of loss, loneliness, feeling of devastation (even though I have a fantastic family and friends), and a feeling of sorrow that I did not say all the things I wanted too, as I was too busy looking after her.
As noted above I have the best family and friends but I feel alone without my best friend by my side and feeling her touch and closeness.
What has kept me going to date, has been not to let my children down as they have lost their mother, and the fact that she was so strong during her illness and in death I keep trying to move forward through the pain using her example.
If anyone else has had a similar experience, how did you get through?

Two and a half years ago I lost my daughter. She died from drug toxicity. She suffered from depression. 8 weeks after that I lost my husband who had a massive heart attack at home. He was my rock when my daughter died. He was my common sense. He was my closest friend. For the first year and a half I just slept. To escape reality. I never thought I'd laugh again. Well I do laugh but most days I just feel like crying. Night time is the worse. Trying to get to sleep. I just miss them so much. The lonelyness is what gets to me. About a month ago I lost our dog. I thought every thing I love dies. I do have good day but they come in waves. In the last 5 years my family has lost my nephew, my daughter, my husband, and my neice. I grieve for my son who is still alive because he is in jail. It scares me to think I could lose him. Drugs hate them so much.Losing a child is devastating but losing your husband is too. I just wonder is this ever going to get any better. I still ask why. She was my baby. You are not ment to bury your kids before you. Thats a awful fact. My sister has lost both her kids to drugs. It sure makes you tougher that one thing I've learnt. Having to do all the stuff my husband did. Like I learnt how to use the compresser the other day to pump up tyres. I took the door off the wood fire to get it fixed because the glass was broke. Simple things like using the remote control. My husband never let me touch the one in the lounge room. I dont drink or take drugs so I find it hard to understand. What I'm asking is someone who understands all this grief I'm going though. Thanks.

Hi All,
I've just lost my Mum to cancer :( . She was only 64- way too young. She meant the world to me and so many others. I'm really struggling at the moment. I'm trying not to be grumpy with my wonderful kids, but feel it a lot of the time.
I also run my own business in the construction industry, and there isn't room for much time off due to project demands etc. I'm feeling both anxious to return to work, but kind of keen to bring the normality back at the same time. 
I'm thinking maybe a local support group might be good for me, but don't really know what to look for.
Any feedback/ suggestions would be really appreciated.

Hello,
It‚Äôs a long story so I will try and keep it brief. 
Two months ago my mum passed away suddenly. She went to hospital and had tests performed, the next day she was diagnosed with incurable cancer which had spread literally everywhere in her body, that night she went unconscious on life support, machine was turned off the next day and she died. She was 65. It all happen so fast and there was no time to accept or process what had happen during that week. 
That week we found out that she was keeping her symptoms from all of us. This doesn‚Äôt seem possible but surprisingly she was able to keep this secret until the day before she died. She would avoid doctors, tests, hospitals or any health interventions for as long as I remember, we could not even speak to her about her health or even if she had a sore arm. Suprisingly she looked well and still walking around a month before she passed, She deteriorated approx 1-2 weeks before passing but refused medical help and would not allow the ambulance to come get her, until the day she couldn‚Äôt breath properly (which was the day she went to the hospital before getting diagnosed).
she still didn‚Äôt want to talk to anyone about it in hospital and didn‚Äôt want to think about it. We never got any closure or any questions answered on why she ignored her symptoms and hid it from all of us. We have an idea on why but my mum is the only person who can really confirm.  
I never got to say good bye to her or comfort her during this time, by the time I flew to where she was she was unconscious on life support. We don‚Äôt live in the same state. Last time I seen her was 5 months before she died but we spoke a few times a week and texted most days.  Seeing my mum pass away and the viewing did not feel real and it still doesn‚Äôt. But what does feel real is that she‚Äôs definitely gone, and I miss her so much.
has anyone ever been in a similar situation to this or know anyone who has?
grieving is the worst feeling i have ever experienced and it‚Äôs a every day constant feeling of emptiness. Not only am I sad that I won‚Äôt see my mum again, I‚Äôm also thinking about what she went through alone, and many unanswered questions. I still continue to go to work, train at the gym, catch up with friends and family, as I don‚Äôt want to end up having depression.  Mornings are the hardest but as the day goes by it gets easier. 
hope to hear from someone.
thanks.

Evening all, I have never asked any professional person this question probably because it simply hasn't been a problem for me.  Nor is it now....but....I can't seem to find any websites, or long term effects, if any, or posts on Forum about ""not"" grieving  a close family member.  In my case, my mother when I was 16.
The reason I am curious if this is more common that usually thought....is that my sister died a few months ago and I didn't seem to ""grieve"" much then either, even though I had no ill feelings towards her.  In fact I felt terribly sad for her during her illness and problems through life and loved her, still do.   I wouldn't call it""grieving"" though.   (I have grieved terribly for pets...unrelenting pain, distraught with the grief, taking long long time to cope with that kind of loss...but with these 2 people, I seemed to just get on with my life).
Re my mother, I can honestly say I have never missed her, felt sad at her passing, wished she was here, been around to see my children, life's successes, shared my celebrations, not for one second, minute, hour or day since the Dr delivered the news at the hospital. Never felt the need to ""talk "" to her or share anything with her, ""ask"" her advice, cry for her....nothing!          Has this lack of grieving process at 16 affected me in other ways perhaps?   Is that really relevant anyway?     Just curious if anyone else ""non grieves""
Sending wishes for peace and love to you...thanks for listening...Moonstruck

Hello I recently lost my partner to cancer and am struggling with Insomnia at night and listlessness during the day. It is affecting my work attendance as well. I have a history of depression since I can remember and this condition is becoming worse.
",Grief
"
I'm feeling so sad, there is def. a piece of my heart missing. My youngest daughter took her own life, after a massive fight for the last 4 years against depression and anxiety. It started when she was only 16 that she was suicidal, after an attempt she was put into a mental health unit for 7 months. My husband and I were there every step of the way with her, she was sent back home and lasted 3 months, after continual attempts, was then sent to another mental health unit 7 hours away from where we lived. She was 17 by then, I lived in a unit at the back of the hospital for almost 12 months. They worked out it all stemmed from undiagnosed Aspergers.
Finally got her home in 2017 and I worked very hard to get her out socially again, half way through that year she went back to her old job, turned 18, and had a lovely boyfriend. Then last year we had a few bumps in the road but were constantly there for her and with her. Life seemed pretty happy for her. I was thinking too myself that 2017 was tippy toes, 2018 was baby steps and this year was going to be even better.
We had Xmas she told me she had a lovely time, we had a holiday with her in January, there were a few hard days there but we just went back to the holiday house so she could sleep. February she wanted a 20th Goth birthday party at home with her work friends with no alcohol. It was a lovely night.
Then I came home from work on the 1st of March and she had ended her life. The last 8 weeks have been a blur. We are all just heart broken and miss our girl so much, she had a wonderful sense of humour, the most beautiful smile, had so much love and empathy for everyone but not herself. Life is so very short. We loved her so so much. :( xx

I am new here, have never posted before.  
I am so lost.  I lost my brother a little over 12 months ago to suicide which has not only effected my own mental health and struggle with depression and anxiety, it also has caused a flow-on effect in my job, my living situation, finances, self-esteem, weight and everything in-between.  I feel like I've lost a year of my life, and I am still no closer to getting it back.  I just don't know how to function.  I am at work now and overloaded with things to do but cant seem to do anything.  I don't really know the purpose of this post  - I guess I just felt the need to share it and write it down... I have supportive friends but I feel like there is only so much depression from me they can take and they would just get sick of my issues.   I put on a smile everyday for everyone and yet inside I feel like I am breaking.  I was on anti-depressants but they caused me to gain around 25kgs so I stopped them.
I drink most nights...  I don't feel like I rely on it, it takes the edge off, but I never go to bed drunk or wake up hungover... I just have a few but I never really drank before and I wish I could stop. 
I miss him more than anything.  He was the kindest, most wonderful, most talented and thoughtful human ever.  I still don't understand why this happened.  He wol

On February 3rd my 16 Yr old son drowned. He was out having fun with his friends and got caught in a rip. 
His friends risked their own lives to try and save him. 
It's been 3 months since I last seen him. And I'm not coping. 
I have 3 daughters and a stepson I need to keep going for,  but I have nothing left to give. 
My partner is very supportive but I feel like I'm letting her down. I'm not the same man I was before this happened. I feel empty and lost and don't want to carry on.  Everything hurts

My ex who was also my best friend committed suicide last week. He was an ice addict of 20 years. I met him in rehab last year(me for alcohol addiction, Im 8 months sober) and we had an intense, immediate connection. I loved him so fiercely. I wanted to protect him and help him. He had the most beautiful, emphatic heart and I just adored him. He made me laugh, he made me feel love for the first time in so long, he made me glow as he walked into the room. Until a couple months ago we were in daily contact. But he was struggling with the normality of life, I wasnt. I was however struggling to help him and felt suffocated by his need for me. I tried and tried again. I kept forgiving him for his erractic behaviour, disappearances and looking back- i chose to believe him when things didnt make sense...was he using? I knew he used at least once. Was it more? I dont know. i felt responsibility for him. Eventually I couldnt cope and told him I needed to step back. I still loved and cared for him and would always be there there, I really did and I know he knew that but I just couldn‚Äôt be there for him as much as I initially was‚Ä¶I put off doing that for so long.

Our contact from then was sporadic. Late april he asked me for money as said he lost his phone and I sent it. He then said he was in Melbourne in a rehab and he was learning knitting. I was happy, he was safe. I was relieved. My last messages were ‚Äú did something happen? knit me some booties, :P‚Äù. But he wasn‚Äôt there. He was in Tasmania at his mums and he sent me his suicide message asking me to send the medics to an address so his mum didn‚Äôt find him. He said he knew from a young age that he wouldn‚Äôt grow old and for me not to go through the what ifs and not to be angry with him. I didn‚Äôt see his message for 40 mins and I called 000 and the police called an hour later and said they got there too late.

I am in so much pain. I feel physically sick with guilt. I don‚Äôt know how to go on. I don‚Äôt want to die but I don‚Äôt want to exist in this pain, I just want this pain to go away. He was everything to me and I can never forgive myself for not being there and not knowing how bad he was. I just cant see any light

My feelings of guilt, regret and saddness seem to build up and get worse everyday since losing my puppy. 
Willow was the rescue border collie x puppy I had always dreamed off. She was incredibly smart, beautiful and had such a happy and sweet nature. She loved everyone and was pretty much perfect (she didn't even bark and toilet trained herself). For some reason I was quite stressed, I was worried about her being stuck in our small backyard all day while my partner and I worked full time. Although she seemed so happy, had endless kongs and other toys/puzzles we had researched for border collies a part of me thought she didn't belong with us and that she should be on a big property with a family. Sometimes I would wish she was gone so the worry would go too. 
Other than that all was going well. My partner adored her and gave her a run everyday, on weekends we'd often go out with her. 
My dad started taking her to his farm on a Thursday while we were at work. I felt relieved that she had company for the day and my dad loved having her around while doing jobs around the farm. 
For some reason last week my dad decided to take Willow on Friday and spoke to my partner about her staying overnight. She had stayed previously once before when we went away. On the Saturday I had nothing to do so I decided to go shopping. That afternoon my dad was ready to take Willow back home but couldn't find her. She was hit by a car and died instantly. 
When we burried her I kept apologizing to her, I really feel like I let her down and wasn't there to make sure she was safe. I feel so awful for not being there as she's my responsibility, also for going shopping when I could've picked her up and not thinking about the dangers that were at the farm. I also can't help but think my awful thoughts about her belonging somewhere else contributed to us losing her. 
I can't stop thinking of her and keep reliving all the ""what ifs"" over and over in my head. She was only 8 months old.

In October I lost my Aunty, on my first day back at work learnt of one of my fighters committing suicide, heartbreakingly I had tried to call him earlier that day to check in given I had been away. Breaking the news to the rest of the gym was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. On what was meant to be his boxing debut, I had been busy getting the night organised
The one person I was truly looking forward to seeing was one of my best friends. She had been there for me in the weeks leading up, calling me to make sure I was okay, offering to come cook me food, just being her, full of love.

As the night kicked off, she¬†wasn‚Äôt there which wasn‚Äôt like her so I msgd her, a few hours passed and still no reply but my msg had been opened
2 days later, I‚Äôm debating whether to send her a msg or not, telling her how she‚Äôs upset me when I get a call from a friend, asking what happened to her, saying she saw a post on FB she had died.

My whole world crumbled, I remember falling to the floor and just crying, she¬†never showed to the fight night because she died that day.

The mystery of her death was made worse with people messaging me asking how it happened, telling me what they had heard, due to this I was having nightmares of these horror stories people had told I struggled to come to terms with her death, angry that one of my last thoughts about her was that I was annoyed.

On the day I viewed her body in her casket will forever be burnt into my memories, to physically see her, I still don‚Äôt have words for the emotions I felt. To kiss her forehead goodbye and to feel the cold under my lips it took what was left of my broken heart and shattered it into a million pieces. This was my first time seeing an open casket

It‚Äôs coming up to 6 months since her death and I still cry when someone mentions her name, For the first few months seeing someone who resembled her in the slightest way would send me into this panic, I couldn‚Äôt breath & for a second I would feel the absolute strength of the heart ache I was trying to suppress.

That heart ache is still very much present, I‚Äôm learning to slowly live with it, I still cry most days, now I just do it behind closed doors or into my pillow so no one can hear, because when your hurting you don‚Äôt want to hurt those around you.

If anyone was to ask me if I was okay, I would tell them I‚Äôm fine, but under the surface I am completely and totally soul shattering broken.

I lost my mum last April to cancer. She battled it on and off for 15 years but I still wasn‚Äôt prepared. I never thought it would actually take her. I feel like I‚Äôm coping less now than I was a year ago. I‚Äôve had to take time off work which makes me feel so guilty to try and regroup. I‚Äôve been to a psychologist before but I felt it didn‚Äôt help that much. I feel like I‚Äôve had to be so strong for my dad and now I can‚Äôt pretend any longer.
I take it out on my boyfriend all the time and I‚Äôm scared he will leave one day but I can‚Äôt help it even though I know it‚Äôs wrong.
I've been on medication previously but after trying 3 different ones I felt none of them worked for me.
I‚Äôm lost as to what the next step is

Hi all, I am new to this, this is my first post 
The last year for me I would say has been one of the toughest. A bit of background, my best mate last year tried to kill himself and I had no knowledge that he was feeling suicidal and depressed. This was one of the hardest things I have ever had to go through, the constant worrying afterwards that he would try again, I remember I would try and see him everyday and make sure he was alright. This was the biggest strain and I was so exhausted. Last year was also my senior year at high school and I just started university in March. Anyways, throughout last year things got bad between me and my friend, he would send me messages blaming me for stuff and just putting me down a lot of the time and this really affected me. Eventually about 6 months after he tried I told him i could not talk to him anymore until the school year was over as I couldn't handle it. I know that sounds terrible, it took me so long to make myself tell him this. Anyways, I am one who doesn't really like opening up to people and talking about how I am feeling and this is a real downfall. I never realized how much his attempt had hurt me, I felt so abandoned that he would leave me here, we were best friends and he would just leave me. This now, I have recently realized has scared me. I am so terrified of people leaving me now. Moreover, I used to have pretty bad anxiety quite a few years ago and it has been gone for many years but I can feel it coming back now. Whenever I get anxious I start playing with my necklace and that has been happening so often recently 
One of my friends, I first met them in December passed away 2 weeks ago. We were at uni together. This has had the biggest impact on my friendship group, in fact we have her celebration of life coming up in the next dew days. I held it together pretty well but I have my moments when it hits me like a truck and I feel so empty 
Last night I also found out that this time last year my best friend tried to kill himself and I had no clue 
Everything seems to be falling apart, everyone is leaving and it feels as if I am so alone. At the time he tried to kill himself he had so much going on and he has said that he has never felt the same way about life since that time. Now he cherishes it and loves life. But it still hurts so much and I am so scared that something is going to happen. If anything happened to him or anyone i know at this time i know it would destroy me 
Thanks for reading

HI.  I don't know what to say really. My last remaining family member just died and I'm so so alone. I can't get motivated to get up most days. I feel so alone at present. I have no friends to talk with. And no family. I feel it's just all to much to get up and function. I'm falling behind in everything and have lost all self value. I just want to find help but don't know where to turn. The loneliness is getting in the way of everything. Is there help in Sydney? ??

I'm feeling really lost at the moment. After googling and googling, it would appear that i'm the only person this has ever happened to (except I can't be - let's just say it's not a common 'thing').
I received a call from my half brother I've not spoken to in 30 years, 4 days ago. I figured my estranged father was ill and it was time to say the things that needed saying about the fact that he'd abandoned me repeatedly since I was 18 months old. But no, instead my brother told me that my father died 13 months ago. Yep - who does that??!!They'd left it just long enough for any claim on the estate to be difficult (not that i care about that). 
My last interaction with my father had been through his sister, my aunt, who'd 'found' me at 40-something (5-6 years ago). My father threatened her with family expulsion for having anything to do with me. Let me be really clear here, I did nothing to this man. I never lived with him, I never relied on/asked him for anything and yet he hated me. I think it was because I was a girl. He loved his sons.
Anyhoo, I had no opportunity for closure before his death. I'd hoped he'd see some kind of sense before he died and seek resolution or forgiveness or something in a letter. In fact, I'd been secretly holding out hope that we'd be reunited like an episode of Long Lost Family - lots of hugging and tears. But instead, I was completely forgotten - it was as if I didn't exist at all. Just a momentary afterthought more than a year later. It's confirmed my thinking that my grief doesn't matter, I just don't matter. Never did, still don't.
So I'm lost; nothing makes sense. The grief is weird. It's like it's all too late for any of it - there's no funeral to organise, lovely memories to think about or share, wakes to attend, ashes to spread. Just more torture from a family that like to do that to me at every possible juncture. Worst of all is the mourning for a little girl who lost her father and her right to a family a long time ago - but you don't mourn people who are still alive. I grieve what should and could have been. And all I've lost in the process. Not sure how anyone can do that to their child and why it's okay for them. Can anyone make my life make sense?

Hi all, I am 23 and I lost my big brother to suicide in September 2018. I watched him fight a downhill battle with mental illness for about 10 years. The effects of grief didn't really hit me until 3 months later, when something had triggered it.
I felt so sad, confused and disconnected from the world around me - I felt crazy. I started getting intrusive thoughts about a relationship I formed not long after his death. Ever since this occured, I am a lot more in my own head and more aware of my thoughts but there's moments where I can just enjoy the present like I used to. 
For these past few months I've also had light to mild tension in my head, stiff jaw and sore points in my neck and upper back. It feels as if my head is very foggy and I can't fully function.
I mainly wanted to share my story but also wanted to know if anyone else has had similar experiences to this?
Cheers!

My partners dad passed away from lung cancer about 6 weeks ago. He is not coping well nor am I. His parents are separated and he has 4 half siblings (all in their 40‚Äôs) and one full sibling, a he‚Äôs 24. My partner is the youngest at 21. My partner was the only child to be living with his dad and was there to see it all. 
5 weeks after his dad has died, his half siblings have started chasing him for ‚Äúrent‚Äù. They all own an equal share in the house but their dads wishes were for my partner to live there until he has fully qualified from his apprenticeship (in 14 months time). However this wish was onlY spoken of and not written down. 
He is not coping with this well and has since stopped talking to all his siblings and will occasionally take his anger out on me by snapping at me or being moody. My own mental health is not great at the moment as I had so much on my player, and still do. I had to deal with the loss myself, as well as helping my partner get through it and focusing on all the other aspects of my day to day life- new job, strict parents who‚Äôd don‚Äôt understand, and annoying little brothers. 
I am feeling so lost in myself. I have taken the day off work because I am struggling. My boyfriend has made a few mistakes (with regards to girls) throughout this relationship but has always apologised and said he will work on his actions. He hasn‚Äôt cheated but it‚Äôs small things which have hurt my feelings but I have given him the benefit of the doubt. I need an outsiders opinion on how to cope because my parents are of no help and we share the same friends.

Hi this is the first time I've ever done this.  I experienced a lot of grief and loss in the first year after my mum passed. special dates still trigger loss - my question for people - has anyone experienced any delayed anxiety symptoms after they started to feel like they were managing the grief stuff and getting on with life. It's not like I don't still miss my mum, I do every day. But I'm not emotionally crashing - however I am having bizarre symptoms like facial tingling, headaches and fatigue which I am being told is a delayed anxiety reaction to my anxiety/grief from last year?   Has anyone else been experienced this?

I thought I'd come on here to get some thoughts out. This will be a bit of a ramble of thoughts ha. My mum passed away in 2017 from breast cancer, I'm 29 so it feels quite young, quite a full on experience having her pass away at home but still better then other places. She was great fun, always making life a bit of adventure, always very supportive in some pretty rocky periods. I am happy that she crammed a lot into her life and all things considered she got 55+ years of good health. I am yet to see a grief counsellor as its a big line, alot of people have died ha, they look to need alot more pysch/counsellors there, still I have seen a pysch privately but I like this forum idea as its free hah. Good job Beyond Blue and everyone involved.

I have found that is extremely hard to cope with the loss of my mother. I get in my car to and from work each day and I feel like everything is so overwhelming. My mum was a lady who was very kind and lived for her children. 4 years ago we took her on a holiday to Cairns with my wife and Son, we had a great time. I lost my father 23 years ago but for some reason this seems so much harder to come to terms with. I think of all the lovely memories we have had with her and of my childhood it makes me happy that I have all those memories but at the same time it make me feel like I am so overwhelmed with grief..
People say in time it will be better as I am sure it will but when you had a mum who lived for her children the way she did and provided us with all that we needed and took us on family holidays interstate every summer. This was fantastic as it created life long memories I still treasure to this day and I am 52 years old.
My sister and I travelled over 20 years ago to Bali and at that stage we were told we were adopted as mum had to tell us as we were obtaining passports. We didn't care. as she was so good to us and it was never spoken about again.
My sister and Brother seem to be much stronger than me I seem to be so overwhelmed with her loss.
On occasion I have been quote upset at my desk, on a train last Friday whilst I was going into Melbourne. I was just thinking back to all the time my sister and I had taken the train into the city with mum and dad, its little things like that that set you off. Certainly with Christmas just around the corner it's also rather sad not having her with us..
My mum was 88 and a very active person who walked every day and caught public transport and got out of her huse each day to do something . That is until she had a bleed on her brain on the 17 March this year. She ended up in hospital for a little whil then on to a rehab place in Mornington. She could not move or do anything for herself since this happened. After Rehab we had to put her in high care nursing home until she passed away on the 26 Sept. 
In the 6 1/2 months after her stroke my sister and niece who is a nurse and my wife and I were all there 3 to 4 times a week. We would just sit with her in the room knowing that she did know we were there but couldn't really communicate but knew what was going on around her. And we would be there for meals on weekends so we could help feed her.. 
I miss her so much

Hi I‚Äôm new here...I guess I‚Äôm just not able to get over the amount of grief and heartache I‚Äôve experienced in the past 3.5 years. heres my story.
so I was expecting my first baby due July 21st 2015...my world seemed pretty perfect I had everything I ever could dream of. Then on the weekend of July 18th-20th 2015 my mum got unwell with a cold...on the 20th of July i had a conversation with her in the morning and I knew in my heart something was wrong. By lunch time she had become unconscious at home and by 7:40pm she was gone. I was highly devastated. She was my best friend. We would talk every day expect for Sunday‚Äôs because that‚Äôs when we went to go have family lunch with my parents and siblings. Life was never the same. Dad was completely heartbroken and pretty much died that night too.
3 months later in September he had an emergency operation due to bowel cancer and life was a constant battle for just under 3 years for him. It was always one thing after the other the cancer kept spreading and made him slowly deteriorate...last year at the start of July he ended up in palliative care and his body started shutting down. So for the last 3 nights of his life I would go and stay with him every night...the last night I knew something was wrong I was constantly msging my oldest sister who understands medical terminology but more so coz I knew he wasn‚Äôt right....eventually that night as I was waiting for my oldest sister to arrive I was pacing up and down outside his room and I heard my father take his last breath...I was sooo heartbroken. 
i just feel like life ha just thrown the biggest curve ball... although in the time I have had my 2 girls it‚Äôs such a struggle some days...I hate being a grumpy mum...I hate that we are also struggling financially! It just so much stress that keeps building up and I feel like one day I‚Äôm going to crack. I just don‚Äôt know how to get over this whole slump I‚Äôm in. 
My heart just feels so broken and so tired üòì

So today we; my friends and I, said goodbye to our friend, via a memorial service. He had killed himself in August 2017, but wasn't found until a week before Christmas just gone. 
His body still has not been released, hence why no official funeral. And not all his family was there either, due to fighting within the family. 
It was a lovely service ...... But how does one ever make sense of this type of death? 
I feel a mixture of relief that he's no longer struggling, and a deep unrelenting sadness at his departure. It's an all too painful reminder of just how difficult sobriety can be. 
Alcoholism: the subtle poison destroying people, one drink at a time.
Anyway, it's late now so I will sleep. Tomorrow is another day, and I am bridesmaid in a wedding on Saturday. Thanks for reading. Take care out there. And please remember; no problem lasts forever if you take a moment to reach out and share it with someone else. Please please, PLEASE reach out. Don't go it alone. I'm not. I got you lot! 
Nigh nigh. See you next time. Xox

I have lost a lot of people close to me from death and broken relationships. But I am now feeling such overwhelming loss after the death of my cat. It is just as heart breaking. I feel guilt that I had not recognised his illness earlier, maybe then he would be with me now. Instead he was euthanised. He went downhill rapidly but should have lived for many more years. He was my alarm clock, my welcome home and my constant companion. I am going through all the denial, bargaining and anger stuff. I have kept myself busy, I have talked to the few people that I am close to, I am already on anti-depressants but I feel like I have reached the limits of my ability to cope. It seems that life is full of loss until eventually we die ourselves. It also seems that there really is no help for depression and that mild depression is a constant state until some event brings it on full strength. Medication only filters out the worst of it. Counselling has never been helpful for me. I know I'm supposed to think positively and look toward the future and reach that acceptance stage eventually but sometimes life is just shit and there is not much you can do about it. I feel helpless, alone and so very, very sad.

Hi, i just signed up today as I did the depression test and scored very high. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life and having a husband who also suffers this doesn't help. Ill start from 2 years ago where i started to turn my life around, started exercising and losing weight and planning for a wedding and found out i was pregnant with baby no 3. 2 days before our wedding i lost the baby and spent the night in hospital as i lost a substantial amount of blood, this is when things turned again for the worst, l fell in a deep depression where i struggled to leave the house and couldn't be around pregnant women, later that year my mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer and i fell pregnant again so it was hard for me to be excited about the pregnancy because of my mum and i had alot of complications during the pregnancy so i was always on edge. Last year i had my beautiful boy and then 10 weeks later my mum past away from cancer (she didn't even get to meet my son she past away on her way to visit him). I struggle everyday with her not being here and blame myself for not being able to see her much as we live 12hr drive away. To make things worse i lost my grandfather a month after my mum (whom i was close to) my uncle has been diagnosed with brain cancer late last year and this year my husband has suffered a mild heart attack and was diagnosed with a tumor in his kidney which they had to remove.  At this stage the cancer hasn't spread but they will have to do 6month check ups to be sure. I have put on alot of weight and am really hating myself and dont really have anything to look forward to,  i live away from family and dont have many friends and feel incredibly alone all the time, and have no support here so im with my kids 24/7, my kids dont make me happy anymore and i cry almost everyday. My marriage is falling apart as we are always fighting mainly over money, im lost, i dont know what to do and dont know how to get out of it. I feel like im alone and no one understands what im going through probably why i cant make friends and i hide from socially gatherings with my kids school etc. Please help i cant live like this anymore.

My grandfather has been given just a little over a week to live - if that. 
We were never close and we never saw eye to eye. He wasn't the greatest of people. 
To be honest, I used to dread family events and having to be around him.. 
The reason I am writing is because I feel a deep sense of guilt that I don't feel sad at the prospect of him no longer being around. 
I feel like a terrible person that my only emotion is guilt and not sadness. He has lived a very privileged and successful life, he will also be out of pain.. 
Is it normal to feel almost nothing? I am worried by my response to this. I know there is no standard way of feeling and that everybody grieves differently, but the fact I feel no sadness makes me wonder what is wrong with me.

Hi, first time contact. I have suffered depression and anxiety and maybe PTSD for 27 years and I am 57, divorced, female and on my own. I was first diagnosed when pregnant first time. My husband was emotionally and sexually abusive. In the early years I attended a post natal depression group and was medicated, as this is what my GP suggested. I only used medication for a few years as it made me zombie-like. Now I reject any medication. Since then I have tried many counselors and psychologists and CBT . I am a Highly Sensitive person and an Introvert. So strangers and groups of unknown people are very daunting and exhausting. My children (boys) are grown and don't live close enough to have a close relationship with. Sometimes only see them at Christmas. We are in contact regularly by text messages, but they have their own lives to lead and difficulties to face. Because of my Introvertedness, I only have a couple of close friends and don't socialize at all in unfamiliar situations. I do work part time, have done at the same job for 5 years (I don't like change) and am part of a volunteer community group, but this involves very little socializing, only a monthly meeting.
 I describe my depression as ""overwhelming sadness"" and that I have lost my soul. 
I struggle to make myself achieve anything - even the dishes sometimes. My depression is parallelizing and debilitating. I am indecisive, a procrastinator and have no energy. I sometimes justify not doing anything by saying I am ""recharging my batteries"" or just ""having a quiet time"". And it only affects me and not bothers anyone else as I'm on my own. But, being on my own, I have jobs to do to maintain my property (that I can't afford to pay someone to do) and nothing is getting done because it all seems too big to handle. 
I have achieved in the past, I actually Owner Built my own house 18 months ago (finished after 3 years work) doing a lot of the work myself. 
I have been happiest in the past creating things - painting, sewing, woodwork. But I am struggling to get enthusiastic even about the creative things that will bring me happiness. I have always denied myself pleasure - I thought it was a mother thing, but now believe it is the long term depression. 
And now I am fearing I will never find love again either, because I am so damaged. I find it so hard just to start a new friendship. 
Thank you for reading my post. I look forward to comments and reading what others are struggling with on the site.

My husband of 16 yrs died from complications of cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) on 24/12/19. Being a rare cancer, he tirelessly campaigned for recognition of rare cancers. He travelled to Canberra to have Parliament recognise this cancer and managed to get a few members to wear the ribbon and had Sen. Catryna Bylic speak about it in the House.
He was diagnosed August 2016 and had a Whipple procedure, 9 hrs of surgery where part of his pancreas, intestine and bowel removed to try and avoid the spread of cancer. Soon after 15 tumours were detected in his liver. He was tested for an immunotherapy trial but didnt meet the genetic requirements so opted for chemo. He coped pretty well with chemo for about 8 months eventually trimming down to 2 tumours. Those 2 continued to grow despite other chemo options. 
6 mths ago we moved to the country to enjoy the peace and tranquility he craved. During this time he spent many times being ambulanced to hospital due to high fevers, some of which couldnt be explained. I spent the last 5 mths driving to and from hospital, a 3hr round trip, to either visit him or bring him home. Once home he became increasingly dependant on me to the point where i had to help him dress and shower. Our oncologist never gave us a life expectancy and continued to look for a treatment and manage symptoms. Therefore, we both held hope and only occasionally allowed ourselves to believe this was terminal. It was one day at a time until the last appt with dr asked if he agreed to an advanced health directive, ie, do not ressucitate. I saw the light go out of his eyes. The next day was the best he had in months. Full of beans, lucid and hopeful. That afternoon he had a major stroke. One and a half days later he let go.
My problem is I cant stop thinking about how the cancer ate at him. I refused to see his decline as i kept hope. If he cried or got scared, i was the strong one. I have no regrets but cant stop mourning the man he was before cancer took hold. I never showed fear in his presence. 
Now i am a mess. Everyday seems worse as the reality sinks in that no, hes not in hospital waiting for me but Im never going to see him again! I have friends nearby who distract me but when im alone im so lonely and the house is so empty.
He was my 2nd husband. My 1st was a cruel man and i suffered ptsd from his abuse for many yrs.
My 2nd husband healed me by showing me what a real man does, and replaced my bad memories with pure joy.
Im just so lost!

Hi, I'm still in shock I think. In July my partner (only 46 years old) had some abdominal pain and a few days later we found out he had stage 4 terminal pancreatic cancer. He died painfully 8 weeks later. I can't sleep or eat and although I'm already on antidepressants for anxiety, my panic attacks are coming back. I have a 7 year old who I have to be strong for but I feel like I'm loosing it. I can't afford to take any time off work so even though he passed away two weeks ago, I have to just shut it all off. So I would love some advice about how to let go and grieve - but while still having to day to day things like school drop offs, work, after school activities etc. Thanks for listening :-)

Thrice in my life have I had to deal with suicide; Stacey was saved, Christie was lost, and Bobby found something worse: he's physically alive yet mentally catatonic. What signs did I miss? Where there words that did I not hear? Or behaviours I ignored. What could I have said or done to prevent them from believing there was no other choice?


I find it easier to deal with relationship breakdowns and stigma as those are issues I have direct and recent personal experience in, but their attempts at suicide are some of the ghosts that haunt me the worst.  I rarely speak of these as they are most painful when they return to active memory. Even Stacey's, I can still see her on the floor.

Why is this so hard to write about? 
(please bear with me, this is going to take a few day or so to get out)

Please bare with me on this difficult of all topics.
If someone has never parachuted, how can they describe the event to someone that has never jumped? A soldier in war describing it...painting the picture? 
We all have various experiences that define us as unique. So when it comes to losing a child parents often describe it as ""indescribable"". How can they paint that picture?
Most of us have experienced grief, the loss of a loved one but to lose a child is, it seems, on a higher plain.
As I've worked with victims of crime one challenge has been to find ways of obtaining relief from such grief. We as humans cant possibly compare grieving circumstances of such loss except that anger would rate as an added emotion with some. Anger at a perpetrator or someone seemingly or directly responsible can envelop a parent creating unimaginable intetnal anguish. 
Getting a life back following such loss is often most difficult. The first rule of thumb is to have no rules. No expectations. Gentle ears, calm, waiting for that one signal that is positive towards moving forward with day to day activity.
There are ways to lose a child other than death. I've lost a neice to a cult. At 14yo she ran away from blood family. She's now 33yo, has children of her own and is estranged from most blood family still.  Imagine the hurt the parents and 5 siblings feel? Their child still lives but near zero chance of reconciling. ..is also a unique form of grief. How empty?
Ive found there is not any ""best practice"" to move forward and pick up pieces of ones life to become productive following the loss of a child. One way to help is devoting ones life towards helping others in the name and honour of their child. A cause.
Memorials are common. Honouring your child's life by deeds, in a way allowing your childs life to result in a positive project of some sort of your choice doesn't have to be public if you prefer it to remain private. Grief can be very private or maybe public especially if fundraising.
My good neighbours son passed away in a car accident. Days later his daughter in law had items owned by his son to collect. Amongst them were 50 potted rose plants his son prepared. His son adored roses. He took them home, planted them in a special garden, takes cuttings and pots them for others in town. He never takes one cent. 
This small hamlet in spring is adorned with his sons roses. Wow!
Most of us cant relate to losing a child. We can find a way of their memory to live on.

My beautiful son suicided on the twelfth of May 2015, he was twenty four years old.  I struggle day in and day out to stay here on this planet which I call hell.  This morning I found myself crying for no reason, I haven't cried for a while but it just hit me this morning.  I rang my mother because I just needed to talk about anything really but she rushed me off the phone even after I had told her how I was feeling.  I have no one.  I live alone and I have no one.  I struggle to see a point in keeping on going.  I have a bone disease which causes me to break bones very easily, I currently have a broken hand and shoulder and I am so sick of pain.  Physical pain every day is depressing me on top of the grief I am dealing with. I honestly do not know what to do or who to turn to.

So I've scoured the web for answers on why I can't shake this feeling, most pages say it's normal to feel this way but I've now felt true heartbreak so bad I feel like someone's hit me in the chest. 
We had two dogs. Our older family dog passed away a couple of years ago, he lived a wonderful, long life. Our younger dog has always been pretty stubborn and demanding, so when we introduced a new puppy just before my 21st birthday last year, they didn't get on. Mum and dad couldn't deal with it, the two dogs fought more and more frequently and it was dangerous and unfair for everyone - especially the dogs. Mum and dad came so close to surrendering our new puppy two or three times before it actually happened. Dad got between them and he was bitten on the leg, it wasn't really major but it was clear to us all that we couldn't keep this going the way it was. I moved out of home again and then mum seriously broke her arm. To prevent anymore fighting or injuries, mum and dad surrendered the puppy to the RSPCA. At 8am on my 22nd birthday the RSPCA came and picked up my best friend. I'm unable to know who adopted him and I find myself looking out for him when I see a black and white dog. 
I feel as though I've lost a part of me... a gorgeous, playful and intelligent little part of me. It's been more than 6 months now and I feel exactly the same way as I did back then. I can't shake it. I've noticeably developed this ridiculous anxiety since then and don't know if I'll ever move through this. I've lost family and friends before and been able to come to terms with it; I'm just unable to comprehend that someone I've never met is out there with my puppy. On top of that, I've convinced myself that it's ridiculous that I even feel this way. 
Please share an opinion, story, advice. I don't know what to do with myself.

Hi. I'm new here. Not really sure where to begin ........ I joined here for a few reasons. One is because I'm sick of Facebook and the 'same old same old' stuff that gets around on there .... I'd rather something a bit more 'real', you know? 
But I've also joined here because recently I've experienced the loss of yet another friend through suicide. And sometimes, I feel as though I'm getting too 'used to it'. this is probably now about the 10th person I know to die from suicide. But then, there are other times too when the wave of grief and shock is so overwhelming that I can barely breathe ....... 
Anyway, that's my story at the moment. Sorry if it's full on. Today was a pretty good day, but I'm also mindful of the funeral that is yet to come.

About 18 months ago I lost my father to bowel cancer. Watching him die was the most horrific experience of my life. He went very downhill and died within a few weeks, after living with the disease for several years. He was devastated, terrified and unprepared. In hospital during the final days he would cry in pain and ask where he was going when he became delirious. He turned yellow and didn‚Äôt recognise me. My father remarried an awful woman 35 years younger than him and while he was ill she demanded he leave her everything in his Will, otherwise she would divorce him and take his infant daughter back to the Philippines. So me and my disabled sister had to go through a terrible legal battle after he died, just to receive a very small portion of what we were entitled to. There was really only the house left, she had drained all his savings and superannuation while he was ill. 
All the while my boyfriend at the time was a very emotionally detached and distant person, he tried to be there for me, but often that comprised of saying nothing and staring at me blankly. It made me feel so misunderstood and alone. A few months afterwards we broke up. I didn‚Äôt want to, I really loved him, but I just felt so unbearable sad and sick with grief and I knew he was just making me feel worse with his emotional detachment. I thought things would just disintegrate and become horrible if I didn‚Äôt end things amicably. He didn‚Äôt put up a fight.
I think for the past year I have shut everything out, I have developed problems with alcohol and motivation, many mornings I‚Äôd wake up covered in bruises with no recollection of the night before. Twice I concussed myself by blacking out while drunk. I‚Äôve worked extremely hard seeing a psychologist to overcome the grief and poor coping, and I‚Äôve finally started feeling a bit more normal again. 
I miss my ex boyfriend so much and regret our breakup. Recently he spent a night cuddling me and holding my hand in his bed after a night out with friends (he wasn‚Äôt drunk) then he turned around and said it meant nothing to him and he has no feelings for me. It just broke my heart and now I feel back at square one, even worse than ever now. I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôd hurt and humiliate me like that, even after we broke up we stayed close friends and he said he loved me. It‚Äôs so hurtful and I feel like my life has become unbearable. He knows how hard everything has been for me and I just don‚Äôt understand how my life has ended up so horribly.

It's been a over a year since my mum died of cancer. I was her primary carer for 2 years, doing all I could to help her recover. Now I'm still crippled with anxiety and depression, living in her house which we shared. I'm 60 yrs old. Finding it almost impossible to forge a new life. Meds and therapy have proved useless. All I can try and do is eat healthy, a little exercise and sleep when I can to forget the nightmare she is gone. I know I need to get out more, but the apathy and lack of enthusiasm in anything is overwhelming.

Hi all,
           In 1994, I was widowed when my then wife had breast cancer. 6 mths later my then girlfriend found out that my 6yo daughter had been molested by a friend of my late wife who was living with us. For at least 3 mths after, I experienced what I call Emotional Tsunamis; experiencing an interchanging wide range of emotions on a daily basis (at extreme levels). I never had any counselling as it wasn't available in my town or area back then, although I wrote heaps of poetry and later music to try and release pent up emotions. Though I happily remarried in 1997 (still going strong), to this day, I get easily irritated by things or situations not going right, or not working. With people I am fine and couldn't be more patient and accepting.

Is this irritation (and it can cause me to complain, curse and sometimes swear) a hangover from 1994? How do I deal with it as it sometimes irritates those around me?

Just over a year ago my fianc√© took his life after a silent battle with depression. Neither me nor my daughter ever saw that he wasn't okay and never expected him to do something like this. Since then his family and friends have refused to talk to me or my daughter and blame me for his death. My partner, daughter and myself spent over three years living just down the road from his family which was an absolute disaster as they did not accept nor like me and my daughter. My daughter and I spent family dinners being glared at and ignored but eventually the three of us moved to a new house. Just two months later he did this. My daughter and I have been forced to move to a new state as I have been verbally attacked at my local shopping centre and home. This has left me depressed, lonely and sad. I struggle to do everyday tasks as one minute I am fine the next I am angry then sad. I spend countless hours asking myself why and how did I not see this.

When I was a child I used to cry into my pillow wailing that I was so alone. I was always told I was dramatic as I had a large family. After years of denial I now understand why I felt that way.

But I haven‚Äôt, they‚Äôve never been there. I‚Äôm not sure how to except that the expectations I have of needing my parents to be the parents I‚Äôve always  needed.

Hi everyone,
Christmas can be a really wonderful time of the year but it can also be a really difficult time of the year.  I thought I'd create this post to talk about ways to cope or even just acknowledge some of that pain you might be feeling over Christmas and the new years.
For me personally, it feels heavy - I think there's a part of my brain that's like ""oh they aren't here today"" before it hits me, or conversations that used to be light become harder and heavier.  I think it also brings up a lot of sad memories not just joyful ones, as a lot of Christmas's for me were hospital visits which is not something anyone wants to experience.
So here's a couple of things I've come up with - maybe you can add to the thread if you like about how you cope or what makes things easier?
If you are struggling know that we are here for you and the forums and the support lines will be open all over the Christmas break.
- It's okay to say no and not do all the things.  
- It's okay to let go or create new traditions, or to keep the ones that you have.
- It's okay to take time to think about your loved one.  Maybe you want to go to the cemetery, look through photos, leave an empty chair at the table, make their favourite dish, write letters to them, donate to a charity, light a candle or even just talk about it.
- It's okay to not give gifts, or to give different gifts.  I do a lot of my shopping online which makes things a little less overwhelming.
- It's okay to take time for yourself.  
- It's okay to cry.  Or scream. Or talk about it.
- It's okay to ask for help.
- It's okay to laugh or have a nice time.  We're allowed to do that and not feel guilty about it.
The biggest thing that's going to help me over Christmas and new years is to be kind to myself and give myself permission - and somehow I think that might help you too.  We don't owe anyone anything.  We're allowed to hurt and cry and feel like the Grinch (or maybe that's just me!..).  But we're also not alone.

I‚Äôm finding things especially hard this year. I‚Äôm supporting my fianc√© after the last 3 mental breakdowns with 2 hospitalisations within the last year. I am feeling so low that I‚Äôm running on empty. I spend the little hours I have when I‚Äôm not working finding ways to help and support my partner. Most research tells me that I need to look after myself however it‚Äôs easy to say this when you aren‚Äôt constantly worrying. My partner has been constantly mentally unwell for over a year now and have no peace. He is my soulmate, I will not walk away because I love and cherish him. I understand he is not well causing his constant I‚Äôll state of mind and downward spiral. Im doing all I can to keep him alive or medication, healthy diet. He has tried ECT numerous phycotherapy, recently a failed drug trial which sent him into psychosis.. got worse from there. He doesn‚Äôt take alcohol or illegal substances and never has. Why him?!
My dads death anniversary is New Year‚Äôs Eve. This time of year cuts me deeply and feel so sad and low,  hurts that I can‚Äôt just be sad around him. I know he can‚Äôt take it when I am low. What can I do besides hold it in?

Hello first time writing in a forum üëãüèº
I recently started seeing a psychologist for helping cope with the loss of my brother passing away. I had been avoiding my feeling completely for 2 years and it resulted in my partner of 10 years breaking up with me for being too sad 
I have been to 8 therapy sessions and my psychologist has suggested i might benefit from anti depressants. I‚Äôm unsure about this as I don‚Äôt have any experience or know anyone who has been this type of medication. I don‚Äôt really like taking medication in general. 
I want to feel better but since opening up in the sessions I find I cry all the time. In general I feel completely hopeless about my life now and have so many negative self thoughts that I really struggle to make go away. 
I dont really know what I‚Äôm after with posting this, just I guess if antidepressants help with these problems
thanks for reading

Hi guys,
As you guys can tell I'm new here. I have difficulties reaching out in real life. I've had Depression since I was 12 years old, and anxiety hit me hard when I was 21 until present. Things just really started falling apart for me after my father's death in 2012. Sadly, I've had many counsellors and Psychologists during my teenage and young adult years but I could never really communicate well face to face. I know I need some kind of help and support, but I'm always so stubborn and in denial. 
I feel like I'm just strapped down and chained to the floor, inside of a locked cage. I find it difficult to keep swimming in this huge ocean called life. There's so much going on in my life that I literally feel like curling into a ball in bed and going to sleep for good.
I don't know who to reach out to, I live with my mum but I don't want her to stress and worry about my issues while she has medical problems herself. I have a boyfriend, but my whole relationship is just very complicated and hard to explain. I have no friends, due to my anxiety. I do work but since quitting my last job and moving on to my current job now, my salary has been a complete flop. I have about $8.5k in credit that I desperately need to pay off, but can't because my job sucks. I have missed calls and emails from credit companies and property agents about overdue payments that are going over my head and I am living each fortnight with just barely enough money left over for petrol and cigarettes. 
I'm drowning and even with the support of my family, I feel like the dark shadow that has been with me for years will end up being the thing that drags me down until the end. 
I don't want to burden anyone but I just need a sense of direction in my life. I want to take control of myself and be able to not feel like I'm miserable each day. I really need help. 
Thank you.

My dad took his own life two weeks ago.  There was no warning.  He always seemed happy.  No one I've spoken to had any insight that this would happen.  It has shaken me to my core.  I keep asking him why but get no answer.  My uncle (his brother) also took his own life 10 years ago, and I've learned their father was also a recluse who basically drank himself to death.  I can feel depression pulling at me.  On top of being unable to believe my dad is gone, and how he did it, I am also thinking that I will be next.  Clearly, it runs in the males in the family.  This scares me so bad.  Having daily anxiety attacks.  Scared of where this will all lead, but not showing anyone to be strong for the family.  Just can't believe this is happening.  It's like a nightmare I want to wake up from.

I lost my grandfather this year he was my best friend, hasn't been any easier since the day he left me. He raised me since I was 2 weeks old him and my aunty (my dads sister) but she past away when I was 11, I grew up with her always travelling away for operations because she had cancer... my pop lived 5 years after her now im left feeling alone - my brother is pretty messed up he used to bash our mum even when she was sick after chemotherapy and I was to little I couldn't help it, I resent him but my mum told me to forgive him before she passed away - uhhh ive tried to but its hard, my brother is locked up in jail at the moment thank god because he was on heavy drugs, I guess that his only way of coping with it all - he didn't even make our grandfathers funeral because he was in jail, I spoke to him on the phone it was hard out opf all people I thought he could of been the only person that would understand what im going through since pop helped raise the both of us since we were babies.
 
Man grief is hard to cope with its my first time opening up but typing makes it easier than talking to someone for me; I just hope everyone that is grieving can find the help they need on these online forums - that's what I'm going to try and do.
 
Feel free to share your story with me; I'd love to hear and help if I can.

My partner and i have only been together for 9 months, but we have known each other and been bestfriends for 10 years. 
We have been trying for a baby for about 5-6 months now. And i have had 2 miscarriages.
its so horrible. The first time i had to point to a pregnancy test to tell my partner. Naturally first he asked if i was pregnant, i shook my head than he asked ""your not"" all i replied with was ""anymore"". And the second time was a month ago and i only told him 2 days ago. 
The physical pain is the worst pain, but the emotional pain... its hard to explain, you feel as if you have lost part of yourself, like someone has taken one of your traits or characteristics and a piece of your heart aswell. 
Its been really hard recovering as the first one i didnt have any time off of work and the second one i had a single day off of work because i was further along and the pain was too much to bare. And since then i havent had a day off of work, i have movdd house, done almost all if the unpacking and moving around the furniture, and doing every last one of the house chores without any help. This is all on top of working 6 days a week. 
im exhausted both mentally and physically, i just wish that it had never happened because it plays on my mind all the time, seeing babies breaks my heart at the moment because its all i want. And it doesnt help i struggle to admit it to my partner so i bottle it up. And its hard to talk to anyone about it...

My beautiful 2 year old cat was attacked by the neighbours dog 2 weeks ago and despite surgery and 2 days of extraordinary treatment she died. I am totally devastated. I got her and another cat from the RSPCA and they were my babies. I tried to keep them inside but she insisted on going outside and would often dash out the door when anyone opened it so I made them indoor/outdoor cats and they were perfectly happy. They would run along the top of the fence and I can only guess that the dog barked at her and scared her and she lost her footing and fell off the fence into their yard. I have so much guilt and ""if only"" thoughts that run through my head. My other cat is grieving the loss of his companion and I have not been able to let him outside since as I am afraid the same thing will happen to him. I am getting a cat enclosure built in my yard so that he can have some outside time, not ideal but better than nothing. The initial grief and shock has passed but I feel it come over me in waves at unexpected times and it takes my breath away. The image of her after she was attacked is forever lodged in my head and upsets me enormously. I am finding it hard coming up to Christmas. I don't want to do anything and take no joy in any activity. I feel like I am just moving through the motions of living without actually living.

Hello everyone. 
I struggle with being alive and having a great family of my own, wich may seem strange but i am left  wondering why i have what i have? 
I have lost 5 Brothers. 3 to suicide and 2 to illness and not one day  goes by without me thinking that i am to blame in someway.
Is it normal to feel guilt just for being alive?

Good afternoon,
Not sure where to turn so thought I‚Äôd post on here.  Got a phone call on Monday night to say that my best friend from high school had passed away and that they believe it‚Äôs suicide (he left a note and his housemates found him when they got home from work).  He lives interstate but we still kept in pretty close contact.  He‚Äôd seemed pretty quiet over the last few months but I assumed it was just because he was busy with work, and sometimes he‚Äôd do volunteer work overseas. Otherwise he seemed perfectly himself and I genuinely thought he was ok.
I definitely feel like i could‚Äôve done more to help, and if not then I just think I must‚Äôve been a really terrible friend.  He was a trusted friend, a massive support to me during some dark times and also just so much fun to hang out with. He was the first person I came out as gay to (I‚Äôm from a strict fundamentalist Christian family and so for me to trust him with that was a really big thing for me).  
It feels selfish for saying this but I honestly don‚Äôt know how to deal with how I‚Äôm feeling about this.  I‚Äôm struggling to concentrate on anything, sometimes I‚Äôm quite teary and other times I just feel nothing at all.  I‚Äôm struggling to sleep and I honestly just feel like a massive part of my life is permanently changed.
I don‚Äôt feel like I have anyone left to talk to about this.  The only person I‚Äôm regularly in contact with is a guy at the gym who I workout with, and while I feel like I could trust him with telling him I also don‚Äôt want to be a burden on anyone, and it also feels like a weird place to being up this topic.
Anyway thanks for reading this, not sure anything can be done but I appreciate it.

hi, just registered on this forum, so please go easy on me!
I had a stillbirth 5 years ago and to this day it still haunts me. I feel like I am a failed mum for not being able to give my son a life properly. I do have a living daughter, now 9 years old, who is a huge part of my life. her father ( now my ex, for numerous amount of reasons I won't elaborate right now) thinks I am still ""whinging about it"" and I should just get over it, stop moping around over something that happened 5 years ago.
is there a ""timeframe"" of some sort for grieving, or being depressed? I used to see a psychologist right after the stillbirth but I felt greatly uncomfortable being in her office. seeing a ""f__g shrink"" apparently should have fixed me not made me feel worse as a mother, my ex said back in the day. not sure why I remember what he uttered all that time ago as I don't live with him anymore and only talk when absolutely needed (he is in QLD I am in WA with my daughter) but upon browsing disability employment services, I thought, ""is depression considered as a disability? oh speaking of which... yeah apparently there's a timeframe for being depressed""
my apologies if I am rumbling. it has been years but it is not an easy thing to get over.
should people just ""get over"" grief after a certain amount of time or is there no such thing?

Hi everyone
My mum (56yo) died suddenly 3 weeks ago. She was extremely depressed, and took her own life. 
She‚Äôd had a breakdown and been diagnosed 2 years earlier, which quickly led to her first attempt on her life. Myself and my two brothers (ages 25-31) found her (after a long search) very close to dying. Other family were involved too. 
Over the following year or so she spent a lot of time in psychiatric wards, had ECT, had numerous medication changes. We attended various mental health meetings with her and her team.
She began a pattern of recovering, return to her own home, stop taking her pills, becoming unwell again, and disappearing. We‚Äôd find out she was missing, go looking for her, and find her near death after another attempt at taking her life.
this happened 4-5 times
Finally she returned home after some more ECT and seemed to have improved. She was still very flat in mood, and couldn‚Äôt seem to get motivated for anything, even her old hobbies. But she returned to work part-time, which had been a very important step for her in her recovery, and we were all hopeful she was finally recovering for good. We tried to get her involved in social groups and hobbies, would take her out for dinners and nice events. She seemed to be on the mend. 
Until 3 weeks ago. We had no warning, none of us noticed she was getting worse. A welfare check was done when she didn‚Äôt go to work. 
She was found dead at home, having taken her own life. Without going into detail, it is certain that she planned this very carefully to ensure it would happen. 
Obviously, her family is devastated. We loved her and we had all tried so hard to get her well. 
In the the immediate aftermath, we were in shock. My family is very supportive and close, so we have all been there for each other as the grief set in, as her children (including me) planned her funeral, had her last viewing, and said goodbye. 
As time goes on, I still find myself  crying at unexpected times, especially at night. My partner has been VERY supportive but I feel guilty for my sudden tears.
Also, Im having panic attacks- over me and my partners life insurance, over my fear other loved ones might die, over if my mum suffered at the end, and even over where her spirit/ soul is now (I‚Äôm not religious).
my worst panic attacks are over her personal possessions i have inherited. I‚Äôm terrified of them getting damaged or lost, as they are all I have left of my mum.
ive booked a counsellor, but wanted to post here. Thankyou

I lost a friend/co-worker suddenly last night although sudden not entirely unexpected. I feel like I don't know what to do, I've had this feeling with grief before and I know it's only early in the grief process. I was feeling down before but now I feel even more down, like everything is pointless now. We were friends but not super close friends and I feel like I shouldn't be or don't have the right to be feeling such strong grief over her death. I feel like if I wasn't depressed, my grief would be more proportional. I actually feel embarrassed to feel so overwhelmingly sad.
Does anyone know any tips on dealing with grief exacerbated by depression?

Hello everyone,
I have been getting told by my close friends that I need to begin some sort of counseling and support since the tragedy i experienced in October. My mother had cancer (originally vulva cancer), which was successfully removed with minor difficulties. Things were on the mend for about 16 months until last October when I received the dreaded phone call from my brother who was under the impression that it was serious but not dire, when he told me that I need to make arrangements and travel interstate to say goodbye to our mum.
The cancer had resurfaced in her pancreas and in under 20 days it spread to her liver and dispersed into her blood stream. By the time i arrived at her side she had under two hours left of her life. I was immediately spoken to regarding the prospect of euthanasia (which i understood was illegal )? However when my personal analysis of the entire situation was complete i could see why that horrible topic was brought up?
I don't know what part exactly has disturbed me the most? The confrontation of crying relatives and sad combined energy, the state of her¬†? or the shock of seeing my mum try to communicate with me in short 10 second intervals before the medication took over her cognitive functionality, she looked like a¬†hippie (I'll never forget her eyes)! I would not wish it upon anyone.
That night after she died i sat with my siblings while they engaged in the ""blame game"" fuled by unresolved conflict and alcohol and that numbing benediction of unnecessary drama never gets any less tedious. I sat there in shock, complete disbelief, that visceral raw emotional pain that I refuse to expel in front of most people.
Being the first born in my family i felt it was paramount that I allow everyone else to break down around me while I jumped into a more caretaker type role. Subconscious denial can be a powerful coping mechanism i guess? I felt every burning emotional sub set listed in fact i even felt others that are a little too dark for any list of symptoms associated with death.
almost two months on and i am unsure what stage I'm in now? I'm not eating, sleeping nor taking appropriate steps for recovery. In a way it's like i chose euthanasia for myself? Secret permission to leave this nightmare. In silence with my demons.
Jay

I need help and advice, please. 
I am a 25 year old woman who has dealt with anxiety, depression and and panic disorder since puberty. 
I am yet to find treatment that works for me, though I am yet to give up. I have found several roadblocks in terms of costs and waiting lists. For as long as I can remember I have found it increasingly more difficult to go to work (and as a child, school) I find myself having panic attacks the night before or the morning of a shift. I have begun to wonder if this is a form of agoraphobia, as any activity where I feel that I cannot immediately leave if I want to, seems to trigger this for me. 
I have fought through this for so long, with it increasingly becoming more difficult. Most of the time I can force myself to do what I need to do despite the nausea and racing heart and general feeling of needing to run far away. But for the last year or so it has had such a hold on me, causing me to miss alot of work and lose a job. 
I decided to study for 12 months instead of working, but the same panic affected me in the same way when it came to placement - and it once again beat me, I'm now forced to withdraw because I was unable to complete the placement.
This has left me feeling suicidal more than once, feeling as though I'll never be a functioning person, though I never act on it because I couldn't hurt my loved ones in that way. 
I refused to sink this time, and picked myself up almost immediately and threw myself into jobs interviews and casual work before securing a full time position.
Three days before I was due to start this job my mother very suddenly and unexpectedly passed away. I was with her and performed cpr on her until the paramedics arrived, they were unable to revive her. 
I did well at first, I kept myself busy, planning the funeral and staying strong for those around me - not wanting them to worry about me. 
But now I just feel hopeless. I took a month off and went to work for a couple of weeks before I got injured and then sick, causing me to miss the past week and dread going back. 
I feel that everything is just too hard, how do I deal with these issues as well as dealing with the loss of my mother simultaneously. I am exhausted, I have been exhausted for so long and now I just feel I have nothing left. 
All of my friends and family have been wonderful, but it's true that everyone begins to disappear after a few weeks. I feel I'm just a burden to them now. 
Please help.

Hi everyone
I'm here because I lost my sister to suicide 5 months ago and I'm not coping. I feel anxious, on the verge of tears all the time, hopeless, irritable and unsure of myself. My partner, family and friends are supportive but I don't want them to worry too much or overload them. I feel like my whole life is pointless even though objectively I know it's not. I'm seeing a counsellor periodically and reading a lot of books. I have a strong desire to change my job and location, but I'm not sure if now is a good time to be doing that. However my job seems intolerable now and I hate going there. I don't know what to do as I'm scared of feeling so hopeless.
Thank you for any help you can give me.

its amazing how time flies and you dont even notice. i have tried to move forward but it still plays on my mind every day. its almost 25 years since my dad died from suicide. i was 10 years old but it still feels like yesterday, i still remember seeing him walking along the side of the road and me on the school bus watching him as it drove away. i knew something wasnt right i had this sense that it wasnt but did nothing. when i got home i found out what happened then it hit me like a tonne of bricks, i could of stopped this i could of been there and he wouldnt of done it. even now i still hate myself and i hate him, i hate him for doing this to me making me feel like this but i still also love him. its hard to figure out how to feel, its tough i cried when i was a kid but now its hard, its hard to be emotional about it as due to length since occurring but i see these people older then me who have there dads still and i feel this tug at my heart of loneliness. i dont have anyone to talk to, to discuss male issues have that father son chat about life. i visited his grave site recently and it was tough cause what do you say a plaque, is he listening, does he understand that the effect this has had on me growing up and still has an effect on my life now. hardest thing i have found is letting go and accepting that he has gone and that i could of done something.

Hi
 
Ive recently had to advise my partner his father has passed away unexpectedly and have been supporting him and mother in law during this process. Mother in law has health issues and requires 24/7 support as her husband was also main carer. Since father inlaw passing mother in law has been stating she is free and can do what she wants now. Doesn't have a care in the world and doesn't care that people are putting there lives on hold and trying to assist her to ensure she is cared for as much as possible.
 
I suffer with Depression and Anxiety and yesterday she kept having a go at me and blaming me for things that I had not done. I know that this is her health concern but she is also being spiteful. 

I am now struggling with my daily routines and feel terrible as I couldn't remain strong for my partner. 

I need help and don't know where to turn.

My boyfriend committed suicide 3 weeks ago. The pain, loss, guilt, loneliness, isolation from this grief is unbearable. Let alone having to come to terms that I'm all alone again. 45 single no kids and broken. He has left a big hole in my life and atm I don't even want to wake up in the morning and process that he's gone all over.  I'm broken over the fact that i didn't get to say the things I should have. I didn't get to tell him that i loved him recently because I was frustrated and dragged down by his depression. Yes I am getting grief counseling and I feel that every body else closely affected has a partner or family to spend their nights with. He was my companion and now I'm all alone.

Hi there peeps. 
Ive written on here a number of times so I thought I‚Äôd put down some of my thoughts and possibly someone can tell me what is what. 
2014 rolled around. Wife and I had found a better place. Life was ok. I had some stressors in my life. A failing family business, a struggling marriage and worry about a diagnosis after a check up (year and half before that I was in correctly diagnosed with liver cancer at 40). Hence the worry. All was fine. 2 weeks after that I started to feel more anxious and started questioning certain ailments and feelings that I had. Could it be cancer? As I started to spiral into anxiety, depression kicked in too. Before you know I severely anxious and very depressed. I was so scared I always needed reassurance on a constant basis. That went on for almost a year. My psych told me it was trauma but If I look back on I now I didnt have flashbacks, I didn‚Äôt have nightmares and I didn‚Äôt think about it. I was just overly anxious desperate and depressed. I knew it would effect my marriage and surely enough my wife left almost exactly a year after my mental illness hit me. 
For the next 3 years I begged, pleaded, got angry, gave her space, push it out of my mind, become obsessed, begged, pleaded. Yet I knew her coming back wouldn‚Äôt make me feel better whatsoever. My stupid psych said it will take time. It will get better. What he didn‚Äôt understand was my mood disorder. I felt horrible. Sure there were periods where I felt ok but it would always comeback. I wanted her so badly. In reality I needed her. I was sad that she was gone yet I couldn‚Äôt make myself better. It‚Äôs now been over 3 years since she left and over 4 years since my anxiety and depression hit. I know it‚Äôs not gone as I still fight it everyday yet and I‚Äôve thankfully changed psychiatrists. 
These are what are going through my head;
rumination, deep sadness, anxiety, loneliness, useless, no self esteem, unlovable, feel like a failure, no enthusiasm for life, deep despair about my past with my relationship, no hope, feelings of a lost life, guilt, longing for the past (not her but our relationship, fear of the future, scared, memories of the relationship, not good enough, grief, deep loss, hopelessness.
i can‚Äôt keep living like this and I feel like life is leaving me behind. I cannot see a future or a present and I‚Äôm sick and tired of it. 
Are those attributes are apart of depression and grief?

Hi all,
26 year old male, severe depression, anxiety and regular panic attacks.
¬†
This is the first time I've public posted my thoughts so bear with me.
¬†
I suffered from mild depression and anxiety from my early teens, up until November 2014 when my eldest brother passed away in a car accident at aged 32
following that in 2016 my mother passed away aged 52 from a stroke whilst shopping with my youngest sister who was only 11 at the time.
And again following that, in September 2017 my other brother just 3 years older than myself at 29 years of age passed away in his sleep from pneumonia and an enlarged heart (undiagnosed).
¬†
Since my eldest brother passed away, my depression, anxiety and stress has been unimaginably through the roof, with it only getting worse after each death.
¬†
My last brother to pass away was considered my best friend so it was a ""double whammy"" and i took a month of work from my new job which i only started 7 weeks prior.
¬†
I feel lost, alone and my social anxiety stops me from doing the most basic of tasks, such as calling someone, getting up to go to the shops, etc...
¬†
I came here because I keep having time off work and cant keep it up as my financial situation doesnt allow it, I can no longer do things I enjoy like working on my project car, as I dont have any money to fund it, which make me more depressed and it just keep going around in circles.
¬†
I am currently medicated and have just started taking something to help me sleep (California rockey fuel apparently).
¬†
I was previously on another medication for 4 years, but it didn't work for when my family passed away.
¬†
I cant speak to my partner, friends or family because they get upset when Im upset.
¬†
I bottle my emotions up a lot and I cant help doing it, its just how I am, I've been seeing a physiologist each fortnight for the past 9 months, i feel good after i go but i go back to feeling the same the next day.
¬†
I cant afford more time off work as I am the sole income earner and I currently have a childcare bill in excess off $500 not to mention car regos due, so that stresses me out more.
¬†
What should I do? Please help.

I lost my beautiful husband 6 months to suicide and I‚Äôm so lost and lonely. He was my soul mate the love of my life and now his gone. His family have placed the blame on me and have said some very horrible and nasty things about me it‚Äôis pushing me over the edge and I‚Äôm felling more and more like I want to go with my husband. My husband had suffered from depression and alcoholism due to a very traumatic childhood and he would not seek the proper help he need he would always say I‚Äôm ok Baby. We loved and adored each other and to think people are saying my husband didn‚Äôt love me is breaking my heart üíî. I don‚Äôt know how to go on anymore I have been in hospital twice since his death. IS IT MY FAULT MY HUSBAND DID THIS? I need help to understand why his family blame me so harshly I loved them. We had a fight the night before due to his drinking and not working for over 2 years things were getting really hard financially as I was the only one working this got so bad we had to start selling our personal belongings and were going to be evicted from our rental house I should have kept my mouth shut and never said anything to him I live every day blaming myself and than to also have others blame is just to much. Even though we had our ups and downs like all couples do we never stopped loving each other I just want my husband home with me.

Hi all
this Thursday marks the 10 year anniversary since my Mum died. She was 63 and had melanoma. My family are all in UK. I went home to help nurse her and spent six weeks away all up. Then I had to leave my grieving father and come back to life in Australia to my husband and children. It was like a nightmare. I have not been able to go back since. I can‚Äôt face the long haul flights and the emotional toll. I feel like a bad daughter and I have never seen my mother‚Äôs grave. Feeling torn up inside.

...I have this constant feeling like I‚Äôm just waiting for another terrible thing to happen. My gran died of brain cancer. Then my bf died of brain cancer two years later. Then my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer. 
I now live in an almost constant state of paralysis. Like I‚Äôm just unable to step forward because I feel like something else terrible will happen. I don‚Äôt know how to not feel this way... when every time people have said ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, life will get better‚Äù ...and I have tried to get back to living, life hasn‚Äôt gotten better. 
I am also almost in constant pain after some surgery. It‚Äôs been 3 years of pain, and multiple specialists. When you‚Äôre in pain, with a sense of nothing to look forward to accept more pain... the world looks pretty grim. 
To make matters worse, I have very few friends left in Sydney. By few I mean one... and she‚Äôs busy.  I can go weeks without hearing from anybody. My husband is supportive, but he‚Äôs busy... and can‚Äôt offer advice or relate. I get the feeling he loves me but simply doesn‚Äôt know what to do or say. i guess if I don‚Äôt, then why should he. 
I honestly don‚Äôt expect anyone to say anything that will make me feel better. I guess I just needed to let someone, anyone know... perhaps someone will relate, or has experienced worse than I have and gotten though the other side. I have spoken to counsellor, but to be honest... they always want to discuss the deaths in my life... and considering they were pretty awful to witness, I don‚Äôt want to keep going over them. 
To anyone who takes the time to read this, thank you... and I‚Äôm so sorry for how pessemistic it sounds. I am not okay. I just pinned up photos of everyone who would care if I just ended my life... and it‚Äôs not many... it‚Äôs not many... 
In tears. I know there‚Äôs no easy solution... I just needed to at least write my thoughts down... even if it doesn‚Äôt solve anything.. at least I‚Äôve finally acknowledged that I‚Äôm not okay.

Hey all,
 
I lost my dad the other week from brain aneurysm. It was so sudden. I am finding it hard to cope with being so down. I can not stop thinking about dying and the thought of loosing my kids or anyone else close to me.  This is the first death in my intermediate family in my life that i have had to deal with. I am also a mum of 4 and help my husband run a business. I am also the oldest of 5 siblings. My dad was my mum's fulltime carer as she has battled some different illnesses and cancer twice. I am being strong for everyone but really feel myself declining.  I know i have to keep it together for my family as they need me. I just don't know what to do. I feel sick and so down i can not feel happy at all. I get it is still early stages but i do not know when i will ever feel better. Thanks for listening.

Hi,
When my Mum was 15 she had a baby with my now step father. I found out about her when I was 16 and we met. I always wanted an older sister and I was excited. As always life happens and it was difficult to keep in touch. In Dec b4 xmas she and her 3 yo son were killed overseas. She has 3 adult children that are still struggling with her loss. I always thought I would have time to get to know her better, but we didn't. I was so proud of all the obstacles life had thrown her way and how she met these challenges head on and maintained a positive up beat attitude and overcame them. I regret I never got the chance to tell her or get to know her better.
In Apr I also lost my Grandfather. He was my hero. When I was first diagnosed with MDD over 20 years ago he was my rock. It took me some time to tell him I had been diagnosed. I called him on a weekly basis for a chat, he always made me feel special and loved. We laughed and talked about immature things, cricket and AFL. He cared for my Grandmother, who suffered dementure , for 5 years on his own. When he was in his late 80's he was finally convinced help was needed. He moved interstate to be near his daughter and he only left Grandma when he was told by Nursing home staff. When she passed he was devastated. He lost his the love of his life. Every phone call after he would say he wants to die and be with her but he can't. He survived 5 years without her. I had always planned to visit him every 6 months. But life happened and I was never able to. I deeply regret that I could not be with him, talk with him or support him in the way he had done so for me.
This has all come to the surface now. I think I pushed it down to get on with life. My work has an assistance program for counselling but I have been before and I am not comfortable with them. I don't know what to do or who to turn to. My husband is not the best listener or most supportive person.
I can't sleep, I feel low, I am having lots of terrible thoughts, I'm teary, the only thing holding me together is my kids.
Any advice is welcome.

Hi, i lost my daughter in november 2017 at 20 weeks pregnant. I am now pregnant again which i am grateful for but i just feel so flat all the time. I think i may have antenatal anxiety and depression. I feel like a terrible mother because i just keep wishing i had my daughter here, she would be almost 3 months old now. But does that mean i dont want this new baby? I really dont now how to feel and im so sick of the thoughts running through my head and all the triggers that make me feel so sad about my daughter. Im also scared that something is going to go wrong in this pregnancy and i really could not handle that pain again.
My husband and i talked very openly when we lost our daughter but lately i havent felt like i can talk to him about  how low i feel. I think i am ashamed.
 
Any advice?

Hi All, I am new here and really don‚Äôt know where else to turn too for help, answers or support because no around me knows what to say or do. 
My fianc√© took his own life and has left a massive hole in me and our childrens lives. I don‚Äôt know I can go on any longer the pain I feel is like no other I have ever felt, I can hardly look at my children anymore I feel so empty inside and hearts broken for not only myself but my kids as well. I blame myself for what has happened, I feel like I should have done more to help him, I keep having all these ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô rolling in my head every second of every day and my gilt overwhelms me that I can‚Äôt even think straight or remember things. 
And on top of all this I‚Äôm putting onto myself his parents are blaming me as well, they are confirming everything that‚Äôs going inside my head and saying it was my fault this has happened. That our relationship was to blam and I drove him to do this to himself. I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how this is effecting me mentally, it‚Äôs making all my dark thoughts feel so true. It‚Äôs making me feel like I no longer what to be in this world, the pain I feel is to great to even get over. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, I feel hopeless. 
I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm looking for on here but maybe deep down I just don‚Äôt want to feel alone, that someone out there knows how I‚Äôm feeling? I want to make it through this but don‚Äôt know I can.

I'm new here but don't really have anyone to talk to. My partner's father died a couple of weeks ago and he is struggling with the grief. I'm trying so hard to be there for him and to help him through this but I keep getting told I don't understand. He's right. I've never lost a parent. I don't understand. I have my own issues with depression and infertility that I'm trying to push aside but if I get upset about anything or he says hurtful things then apparently I'm making it all about me. He's pushing me away when all I want to do is love and support him. I know eventually it might get a bit better but scared I'm going to lose him in the meantime. I've never felt so alone. I self-harmed tonight. I've never done anything like that before and it scares me. I don't expect any miracles but hoping if I can get it off my chest it might make it easier to deal with.

Hi All
My husband died nine months ago after an horrific illness that lasted almost 2 years. I have some PTSD from this. My psychologist thinks that I am over the grieving period. I have been seeing him for 18 years and he saw me and gave me support during this hard time. 
I have also battled depression for over 20 years. I have tried just about every med out there.
i put myself second as my husbands carer and I now am at the point where I think my depression is so overwhelming that I want to try ECT. I feel such despair, fear and cry uncontrollably every day. I have had three hospital stays in nine months. I can‚Äôt keep living this way.
I know I‚Äôm going to come up with people saying nine months isn‚Äôt long and that‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm also young <40 so I need to be able to comprehend a future. I think that ECT is my only option. I‚Äôm so medicated that I can‚Äôt see the harm and it‚Äôs worth a try. I have a grief counsellor too so I‚Äôve been very proactive in managing my health in the last nine months.
Any ideas about how to differentiate between depression and grief? I know depression is part of grief but my depression was pre existing. 
Thanks for reading.

So not sure how this all works or where to go or what to say.
On February 21st of this year my mum passed away at the hands of depressions close to 8 years after my pop passed the very same way. Since feb I have struggled to feel any sort of emotion or even connect to anything. I feel broken on the inside but unable to express or convey it in any way. Things have been nothing but stressful with my partner feeling like I don‚Äôt have any support, yet also feeling like I can‚Äôt put to much pressure on him. My friends have decided they don‚Äôt like my partner which has caused nothing but added stress, drama and unwarranted anxiety. I feel like ‚Äúwhat next‚Äù on a daily basis and just feel lost all around. In myself I know self harm is not the answer as unfortunately I‚Äôve now seen at the age of 25 two family members suffer for to long and knowing the after shock that follows.
Never having questions answered nor having an exact reason why. I lay here tonight missing my mum hearing her voice remind me it‚Äôs ok to be sad, don‚Äôt be ashamed to ask for help. So I guess I‚Äôm going out on a limb and expressing how I feel in a place I feel could and should be safe. As a young man I wonder how to go on. I can‚Äôt fathom a life without my mum but great full I had the time I did. I can‚Äôt picture my mum not being the one to show me how to hold my first child as she held me, I can‚Äôt imagine marrying the man I love without my mum by my side saying ‚Äúcmon let‚Äôs poor a wine it‚Äôs your wedding day‚Äù
Just like my Mum I‚Äôve stepped out to help and support so many others, in the short almost 3 months to the day multiple friends relationship breakups, friends parents giving their last fight before cancer wins, fall outs between friends and family and my partner then to my own health taking a turn and being forced to stop for a minute.
I feel like this is all over the place but that is just how my head feels one thing after another no time to stop and then when I decide to take a moment something else happens someone else happens. And don‚Äôt get me wrong I tell my friends I‚Äôd rather they come to me and talk when they feel their breakup is to much or parent is to sick or work is to hard, rather then suffer in silence before it‚Äôs to late like my mum and grandfather.
Not sure if all or any of this is suitable relatable or helpful but I just thought I‚Äôd let some of what‚Äôs going on in my head out.

When I was 20 my mum committed suicide. I'm now 26 and I feel deeper in my grief than ever before. I had a really delayed reaction to her death (I did not express any emotion for 2 years). We were a pretty normal tight family unit and I needed to be the strength for the rest of my family.
My mum left no note, and nobody really has any explanation of why she did what she did. She was such a great mum to my brother and I, and while I know she had problems (she was an alcoholic) she was a successful business woman and excellent mother, and nobody had any idea she was suicidal.
In addition to all the normal stuff you feel when someone dies this way, there is a lot of blame towards me and the rest of my immediate family from my extended family on her side. I get through this by understanding that sometimes people need to blame someone to cope but honestly it's so wrong that anyone could think anyone was responsible. Particularly my brother and my dad and I. We would have moved heaven and earth had we known she was in danger.
Even so, I feel like I have failed the most important person in my life and I'm haunted by what happened. The permanence of her death still has not settled in and it hits me in waves and knocks me right off my feet.
What should I do? Is there anything I can do?

Hi, I'm 18 yrs old and new to this forum. I'm in my first year at uni and I live at a residential college about 3 hours from home. 
Just over 7 weeks ago my dog passed away. She meant everything to me and her death was so sudden and such a shock because she was perfectly healthy, I was a mess for weeks after and just couldn't cope with her being gone. I saw a counselor after a few weeks of grieving because I was just not feeling any better and my mood was not improving at all, I was barely sleeping, I was still crying every day, and I was just not coping well with life. I was having suicidal thoughts and was thinking of ways to end my life.
I then saw a GP and have been on 2 different sleeping tablets over the past 3 weeks but they only work for one or two nights before they stop working. I've been on antidepressants for 2 weeks but I don't feel these have made any change to my mood at all. I am just feeling very down and hopeless and exhausted all day. I don't have anything to look forward to in life, and I dread having to go back home because last time I went home, I hated being there without my dog and I really struggled to cope and it just made me feel worse. I find it so hard to talk to my parents about what I feel, I don't want them to overreact or make a fuss, or come up to see me at all or phone me heaps. I also just don't think they'll understand what goes through my head all day.
I am trying to go to uni to distract myself and to try not get too far behind, but I am finding it so hard to concentrate on my work, I keep zoning out and thinking about life and dying, and about my dog. I am quite far behind at uni but I am past the point of caring about much anymore. I just feel like every day is the same, nothing seems to get better, and I don't see any point in continuing to live if this is what I feel like every day. I am so unmotivated to do anything and I just feel like my life is meaningless and nothing I do matters anymore. 
 I have been looking up methods of suicide and I am often thinking about ways to end my life, to stop the pain and all these thoughts that are in my head all day. A week ago I got quite bad and wanted to run away anywhere out of this place, I just couldn't handle it anymore, but I managed to force myself to stay and tried to distract myself to stop the thoughts.
I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm feeling so hopeless and down and exhausted all the time, and just needed to get it all out. Sorry for the long post.

hello
I'm a new member.  I'm feeling so upset.  I thought I was prepared for my Mum's death but I wasn't.  It's four months now and the days and nights are such a struggle.
I'm dreading all the ""firsts"" ..this coming Mothers Day, an upcoming family celebration, my birthday, her birthday. ...you get the idea.
On top of that I'm dealing with the likelihood of having to have a loved pet put to sleep.
I'm very fortunate to have a loving partner and lovely girls but I have never felt so lonely ..if that makes sense.
Please tell me I'm not alone.   I'm alternating between crying a lot of the time and/or getting upset and angry with my loved ones.
I have suffered with anxiety and depression for most of my  life..close to forty years so this also multiplies the grief.
Thank you for taking the time to read.

I dont live with mum anymore, i wanted to have my own life, and didnt want mum clinging to me. but now, between mum's memory loss and her depression getting far far worse. she talks about wishing she was dead, crying all day, being unbearably lonely all the time.
i have tried to get her to see the GP. and her psychologist. neither has really helped. Finally mum met a woman who has had ECT and thought she too might benefit from hospital treatment to get on the right meds. she told the doctor and the doctor gave her a psychiatrist. she didn't like last years psychiatrist. this years psych, she can't see for 2 months. two months of her telling me every day that she never wants to leave the house again, that she hates where she lives, that she wishes she were dead.
then of course every other day where she seems aware of her situation and wants to try to fight it... but I know by the time she gets around ot doing anything the feelings will change (within the day).
i suffer depression and anxiety too. not to her extent, i'm able to self manage. talk myself up, mostly. but i dont wantto be around mum when she is like this. she makes me so angry, she one day is asking me to help her get a dog trainer, the next day she's cancelling and telling me it's all too much... i dont have much time or energy in my own life, i work full time and i barely cope with that. i like my alone time. i sleep poorly. amd i'm generally just struggling to have any social life at all.
i called the crisis team and they told me to get a sooner appointment with the psychiatrist, but i dont know who they are, mum will never get around to doing anything about it, and her doctor wont tell me anything, or generally do anything much of use... they've left her like this for thirty years... they did nothing for my dad either.
 
i feel trapped. i want to take her to a hospital and say to them"" take her, make her better."" but i know because she doesn't actually plan how to commit suicide they wont do anything. i'm the only person in the world she has. i feel guilty half the tie, angry the other half and overlay it all with a desperation. i know others have it harder, i know some daughters are full time carers for their parents... but i want to have a life..
and i dont know how to cope the next two months or longer until some medical professional sees how serious it is and bothers to get involved and actually help her.

Hello,
My mum died of cancer almost six weeks ago, and I am not coping at all. I was living and working in another city and as soon as I found out I dropped everything and came to be her full-time carer. She was diagnosed at the beginning of December and died at the end of January. I never left her side and slept every night in the hospital for three weeks. I called an ambulance after New Year's because I felt I wasn't coping at home, and I feel tremendous guilt about that because I felt it made things happen faster. I am still beside myself with grief every day. I miss her so much.

I don't really have anyone here that I can talk to either. My dad (who has never been reliable) has stopped talking to me, which hurts a lot as well. My friends are all in other cities. I don't know the rest of my family that well and even so, they all live overseas. I feel completely alone. 

I am still paying rent on an apartment in Sydney as I haven't had the capacity to make any decisions about my life yet. I am going back to work in Sydney on the 19th of March. They're letting me come back part-time, which is nice. But I don't know how I'm going to do it. I have to be at my Mum's house, in another city, to look after her three animals and to sort out the house, which she still has a mortgage on. So at this stage I will be commuting, but it's a 6-hour commute every day by train, and it will be very exhausting. I need to get out of my lease, but I feel unable to do anything. There are bills piling up and I need to call various places to explain what's happened, but I don't know what's wrong with me, I can't do anything. I feel triggered by every little thing. I see a bill and it makes me cry, I hear an ambulance and it makes me cry, I feel like making a cup of tea and it reminds me of her and makes me cry. I'm paralyzed. 
All I can think about all the time is my Mum and what she went through and what happened. Every time I close my eyes I see her last moment or I hear her struggling to breathe or I remember every little detail of the hospital and the cancer. I feel like I'm going to be sick. It's unbearable. I feel like I can't do it anymore and I really need help and I don't know how to get it, so here I am.

Hi, i lost my younger brother in january this year to GVHD after having a transplant from leukaemia, he was 26.
Iv gone through so many emotional stages since he passed but now as time is going on I'm struggling to come to terms with knowing iv lost my only sibling , my best friend, my sons uncle and the person i would call daily to talk about anything or ask stupid questions. I'm so lost in life now and every night getting close to bed time i get these sick feelings he wasn't meant to go there was something else they didnt try, flash backs of his final week when they said there wasn't anything more they caN do but to just make him comfortable now , he basically was asleep 24/7 for 3 or 4 days before he passed but a few days before that he was starting to get confused , i remember him getting scared when a nurse entered n he said no no I'm going home, or if he was in pain looking at me saying please help but the look on his face i had never seen before, when i think of all this my heart races and i clench up , i just feel so sad for him he went through 3 years of pain but every hurdle thrown at him he overcame it like a king but then out of no where from a general hospital stay like any other he had had he never came home .
i dont have a a lot of friends a couple of close ones but iv pulled my self away from them as i just feel like I'm on repeat, and i know no matter how many times i tell them about all this there is only so much they can say back to me before they are just repeating it too and i dont want to continue to burden them with it . 
Has anyone else had or been thru something smilier to this

So my grandpa died this morning and I need to rant. Ok so a bit of backstory, I was really close to my grandpa he was like my parent as a kid when my parents divorced I lived with them for years and he and my nana live next door so I see them everyday, he was my favourite relative. He was diagnosed with skin cancer about 5 months ago and he was in a lot of pain and was in hospital for a while but he was slowly getting better but then they found out he had cancer in his lymph system that it was aggressive and was incurable that was less than 3 months ago. He was really depressed and lost 50kg in a month and has been in and out of hospital and in pain and he has been really mean, grumpy and depressed for a few months. Last week he got pneumonia and went into hospital and has been there since and he just wanted to die so he wouldn't let the doctors treat the pneumonia so they just kept him comfortable.
I have been really detached and unfeeling since we found out he was sick and I was fine I didn't feel anything unlike the rest of my family who have been sad and worried. I went to see him last night and he was unresponsive so we just sat there and the others were talking to him but I didn't because it made me uncomfortable and  didn't know what to say or do. My parents told me he died this morning and I just went oh ok and went back to sleep and was fine all day I studied did a test and went to uni all fine and I haven't cried until I wrote this & IDK why? maybe because he hasn't been himself since and it feels like he was already gone, maybe its because I'm mad at him for not letting them treat him, maybe something is wrong with me idk, I'm ok and then I remember I'll never see him again I didn't even go see the body I just went back to bed. I hate showing feeling in front of people especially family so I will never cry in front of them or tell them how I feel.
Sorry about the rant I don't really know what the point is.

Hi all,
My first time posting here. Perhaps a trigger warning for people who have experienced a loss.
On the 20th of December my mum passed away from a 3 month batttle with brain cancer. It was a very quick decline, and toward the end she wasn't very lucid, and sometimes didn't even recognize me. She was only 44 when she passed, I am only 21. 
I've really struggled the last 6 weeks. I took 2 weeks off work before her death to care for her, and I was there until the very last moment. She passed away at home with myself and my sister standing beside her.
 After she passed I took about a week and a half off work and have been back at work ever since. Been back at work for a month now. It's been pretty hard, and my job is very demanding, not allowing me to take a moment when I need to, I have to be on the job and in the moment every minute of work.
I've taken one day off work since being back, and I guess I'm wanting to take a bit more time off, to gather myself and deal with all my emotions. Do you think it's okay for me to call in sick once a week or fortnight to have a mental health day while I'm still grieving?
I've struggled with depression and anxiety in the past, and I'm struggling now. It's hard to get out of bed, to be motivated and to go to work, but I do. I'm never fully in the moment, well at least that's what it feels like. I feel so hazey and foggy all the time. 
Has anyone got any tips or advice? Things that have helped them in these kind of situations?

Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to read, I really appreciate having a platform to get things off my chest.
I was inviting my dad who lives alone on his farm to Christmas when i wasnt gettting a response and his mobile was turned off. I went to check on him and found him dead on his bed.¬†I was spared seeing his whole body and an autopsy done the next day which revealed he had a gastrointestinal bleed.
I had watched my mother pass away from cancer four years earlier and now to find my father passed away. I‚Äôm Not even 30 years old and I have no parents left and I only ever had one brother.
I‚Äôm married with 3 beautiful children who have helped me get through. But I find when they are in bed and I suddenly have all this time to think, it‚Äôs all I think about and I get this heavy sadness over me. we are also clearing out his property for sale and it‚Äôs been hard to wrap my head around that he is gone. He was a very healthy man so it came as a huge shock.
Thank you again for anyone reading, it has already helped just writing my about experience and hope maybe someone with similar experience can share some light on their experiences.

Hi
My mother died 12 years ago. She was a wonderful mother and I was lucky to have her. I always thought I would still be able to have a normal and happy life and be ok. 
I‚Äôm now in my mid 30s with no kids and this is causing me immense grief - equal to losing mother. My life is not normal. I am in a relationship with a married man with 2 kids. The grief that my life hasn‚Äôt turned out how I planned has resulted in day time drinking, heavy night drinking and small amounts of drug taking every weekend. 
I feel like I am watching my life from the sidelines. Knowing I‚Äôm not being wise in my choices, but unable to get the life I want.

Hi everyone,
I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to put this in the depression or relationship forums as it‚Äôs a bit of both. I‚Äôm currently really not in a good place mentally and emotionally. My motivation to do anything is pretty much non-existent and I‚Äôm feeling so lonely. Long story short, my grandma died three months ago, and at that already turbulent time my three and a half year relationship with my girlfriend ended.
I was already not in a great place before all this happened, I wasn‚Äôt happy where I was in life mostly because 1. I‚Äôm in a job I no longer get any satisfaction out of, and it feels like my life is going nowhere and 2. I hurt my back really badly a back in June and had to stop lighting weights which is the only exercise I enjoy. Because of this I stupidly started pushing my girlfriend away, and things boiled over shortly after an overseas trip where we felt more like friends than SO‚Äôs at times.
On top of the negative thoughts I already had, I‚Äôm so full of regret and guilt that it‚Äôs eating me away, both over my relationships with my grandma and my now ex-girlfriend.
I‚Äôm trying to make changes in my life, but it‚Äôs really hard to do even the smallest things. I‚Äôve applied to go back to uni to follow my career dream but I didn‚Äôt get in for the first round and that hit me hard. I feel like my happiness is tied to whether or not I get in to uni this year. But at the same time even if I do get in I can‚Äôt help but compare myself to my peers, many of whom are off getting married and/or are in careers they enjoy. It also really didn‚Äôt help that the night I told my parents my girlfriend and I had broken up my dad let slip that my previous ex is now engaged. Meanwhile I‚Äôm back single again at 28 and wanting to go back to uni to do another undergraduate degree. I have zero motivation and I‚Äôm so tired with life in general. I have a history of melancholic depression and I‚Äôm currently seeing my GP and a psychologist, but I feel they‚Äôre not helping me as much as they have in the past.

I lost my mother almost 2 months ago. It was a very big shock and very unexpected. She had a massive stroke right in front of me. She was in ICU for 3 days whilst on life support suffering from severe brain damage caused from the stroke. I keep getting flashbacks of the traumatic event that I usually can‚Äôt block out. I am tired of crying myself to sleep every night. I am still grieving, I need to talk to someone but I am unsure where to start. Do I need counseling, therapy, or a psychiatrist?

Hi,
2 days ago we had to put down my 16-year-old cat. I had him for over half my life, he was there when I was diagnosed with depression, when I was suicidal and when I started getting better and being 'normal' (somewhat). He was my constant. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety over 10 years ago and for about 4-3 years it's been for the most part controllable. I have my ups and downs, but mostly up or neutral. Because of this event, I feel like I don't know how I will be able to get through this, I don't want to slip back in to depression but I don't want to move on either. I have upped my anti-depressant dose and made an appointment with my psychiatrist (unfortunately it won't be until early January). In the meantime my mum and other cat are helping me through this, but I still can't see an end to this pain, especially with Christmas coming up, my cat loved christmas. By the way he wasn't just a cat or pet for me, he was/is family and always will be. Please let me know if you have had a pet that you went through depression with and lost them later. How have you coped with it?

I lost my husband last year to cancer.  We are both young ... in our 30s.  In a way, I never thought that I would lose him because he was so incredibly strong. It was like I had spent the whole cancer battle/diagnosis in denial which I labelled as blind hope that if he just held on long enough there would be some new treatment that would control it.  He died in my arms and my whole world changed. I feel like I've had all my limbs cut off.
I thought I was coping okay but recently I've been noticing more and more that I am doing things that worry me.  I am struggling to fall asleep at night. I hate eating and it seems like a pointless activity. In fact, I can't really find much enthusiasm for anything. It's not that I feel depressed all the time. More like I just feel numb, angry and irritable. I have been having large crying episodes every day that I hide from friends and family ... but I don't mind these, feeling the pain and the triggers of these episodes is better than feeling nothing at all.  I am trying to get out and exercise regularly and to go to work but the level of fatigue I have is awful. Sometimes just having a simple conversation with someone is absolutely exhausting. I sometimes can't bring myself to respond to a conversation. I'm starting to really struggle with concentration at work and doing simple tasks is taking too long.
I saw a psychologist after my husband passed and I don't know if it will be worth doing this again. I don't know if talking about any of this is going to help. Nothing is going to bring him back so maybe I just need to suck it up and ride this whole thing out?  Being young it is hard to find support groups out there for people my age. I find it hard to talk about him with people because of how they react - people who know me well are grieving too ... people who don't know me well often don't know how to react and it's very uncomfortable between the apologies from them and the looking at me like I need sympathy.  
I don't know what brought me here, but now I'm here if anyone has any suggestions I'm all ears. Thanks for your time.

Hello,
It's been a couple of months since my last post. I am guilty of only checking these boards regularly when I'm not doing too well. Putting my thoughts, fears and worries out there into the universe seems to help somewhat.
My little dog had to be put down this morning and I'm feeling devastated. I loved him so much and as I'm single and not working he was a big part of my day to day happiness. He was such a joy filled little fellow and I'm going to miss him so much. Everything in the house reminds me of him.
He was a family dog so I have support from my parents and sister but I'm starting to unravel as I'm terrified that I'm going to relapse and have a terrible episode of anxiety/depression again (they've been triggered before by smaller issues than this). I only got half an hour sleep last night so am hoping I'll be able to think more rationally tomorrow after I've slept but I just don't know how I'll get over this.

Hi guys, I am wondering if anyone knows about the relationship with grief and anxiety? It is something I have only come heard of recently. Or if this story sounds familiar to anyone and you have any tips to help, that would be greatly appreciated.
im a 24yo male in Melbourne Aus. Have always been fairly shy/ anxious person and never very happy. My father committed suicide when I was 16 who I was very close to, also lost a fair few other friends and family members not long after too.
i have always tried to be tough and just try ignore these losses when they occurred, I was back at school 2 days after my Dads death and just tried forcing myself to move on. I still think about what happened that night pretty much every day but never get emotional about it, just try put on a brave face and move on.
i suffered with depression and social anxiety issues for the years following my dads death, but it was fairly manageable and wasn't 24/7 life controlling like it is now
about 2 years ago I took some MDMA at a party and got my first panic attack the next day. Since then have been anxious as hell, constantly feel like I'm in a dream (depersonalisation), insomnia that never seems to end, and non stop racing negative thoughts to the point I've nearly taken my own life a few times.
feel like it has slowly started to get better after all the different councelling and medication. but I feel like there's something else to it and that cbt and meds aren't going completely fix my issues. 
Came across some YouTube videos of speakers talking about holding grief causing anxiety problems, my therapist also believes this could be a part of my problem too. Does anyone know much about this? any replies greatly appreciated, thanks

17/11 my life changed forever. I woke up for work and found my mother on the couch who had a stroke through out the night. The ambulance was called and she was rushed straight to the royal melbourne hospital. She suffered a 19mm aneurysm to her brain a well a lot of intense swelling. Whilst on life support on an induced coma in ICU after 3 days she sadly passed away. This was VERY UNEXPECTED I am 26 and my mother was 61. She is my best friend and my everything. The rock to my family. Her death was unfair and so heart breaking. I cannot sleep at night because I think about all the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù. I find it hard to get out of bed and have been relying on friends to help me rest my brain. I‚Äôm often dehydrated and my heart is constantly pounding. Do I need counciling, therapy, a visit to the doctor? I just find each day getting harder and harder.

My Dad was so good. He was everything you could imagine a kind hearted, selfless person could be. I cannot believe he is even gone. Even writing ‚Äúwas‚Äù is bringing me to terms with the fact he is no longer here.
I‚Äôm still half expecting him to call in and give me a lecture about how my car needs a service or that my lawn should be mowed.
It doesn‚Äôt feel real, yet he died 4 days ago. I still haven‚Äôt really accepted it.
He was only 51 and leaves behind my sister, brother, mother and my two children (who ADORED him)
He was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer about a year ago. Underwent chemo for eight months then, when it was discovered the chemo wasn‚Äôt doing anything, the doctors gave him 3 months to live. 
I watched on as he slowly deteriorated and feel like I never really got to say all the things I wanted to before he left. 
Why can‚Äôt I feel like he is actually gone? This is crazy.

Hi guys, I am a newbie here and am not really sure if this is the right thing for me.
A few months ago, a friend of mine was suddenly killed in an accident. She was fairly well known in the community and it hit everyone hard, but because I have been trying to be the strong one and help everyone I haven't really been able to help myself. I continually have meltdowns caused by the smallest of things that remind me of her and it just seems to get worse every time. 
I am not really sure how to deal with it anymore and I just keep closing myself out from everyone and telling them I am okay. 
I just wish there was someway to deal with the pain and stop these constant feelings of sadness and getting upset when I think of her :( 
What should I do?

My brother took his life on the 31/10/2017. I‚Äôm still in the process of organising his funeral, he is the 2nd brother in 2 years. My 1st brother, official coroner‚Äôs report stated ‚ÄúDeath Due To Misadventure‚Äù¬† he has self medicated his entire life, Bi-Polar was his official diagnosis, and now, my closest brother also end his life!! I battled his depression with him for years, I put my own PTSD and depression on the back burner to get him better, I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of losing another brother!! I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of having to tell my mother again and listen to that gut wrenching wail and her screaming we are lying to her! I promised my brother we would kick this together, and I dropped the ball... now I‚Äôm beginning to think, they should never have relied on me in the beginning, I tried so hard to protect them, their fellings, my mother, her ‚Äúshame‚Äù you know, cause ‚ÄúBoys don‚Äôt cry‚Äù and all that!!

I told my kids to stay away for a few days in case I said something I didn‚Äôt mean.... I can‚Äôt understand why he left me with this heartache! He knew how I felt! I would have hidden him forever!! I would have lied to everyone... if it meant keeping him here, I would have done it! Can someone please make sense of this!! I‚Äôm absolutely devastated

I just turned 18 this year and I was excited to discover and explore my newfound freedom, so much so that I didn't get to spend as much time that I wanted to with my small 10yr old sister (who happens to have severe cerebral palsy) before she passed away. Growing up as a sibling to a disabled child, you learn to quickly find your place in the family. In my case I have 1 older sister and 4 younger ones after me. So me, my elder sister, including my Mum were her main carers. I always knew that I held 2nd place in my parents' hearts with all my other siblings, right after my 10yr old sister who I knew held 1st place. I learned to never complain when I didn't get the attention I probably needed from my parents, or when I had to stay home most days to babysit, even when as a family we couldn't go for typical family outings, because who was I to complain against my lovely sister. She was never a burden.
About a month ago I woke up in the morning to my 15 yr old sister's screams against my bedroom door, and I quickly went to see what was wrong.¬†000 was dialled and I was told to perform CPR on her until the ambulance came. I kept crying out to God to help me, that I would do anything, but she still wasn't responding. The medics said the situation looked bad, and they'd take her to the hospital. It was too late she passed away that morning.
The events of that day still haunt me. Walking past her room and seeing the spot where I performed CPR.It's all getting too much for me. I try to go out and forget, but sometimes I find my chest gets so heavy that I can't breathe. I still don't know how I'm going to get through this. I miss her so much and It's just starting to hit me that I'm never going to hold her again.

HI. Now I'm here my fingers have frozen with fear. Ok inhale...exhale...go...
Can a person relapse back into the once depressed, guilt riddled, grief stricken, sucicidal person she once was 8 years ago? Even after all the work she has done on herself?
I can feel my feet slowly slipping out from me, but the icy ground hasn't cracked yet. 
Everyone around me says they are here for me but I know everyone is thinking ""god her daughter drowned in her care eight years ago, she should be over it by now"" whilst telling me how strong I am and how proud of me they are. 
STRONG!!!! I'm the absolute opposite. I guess that mask I wear is working and no one sees the real me.  But why do I pretend because I feel so lonely and completely invisible. 
Two years ago my post here would have been to help people who have lost a child and now my post is asking for an empathic ear because I've used all mine up. 
I have managed to successfully isolate myself from my friends and sadly no one has really noticed. I moved four hours away from home and changed my number. It felt refreshing at the start. 
Is this why I have relapsed? I have told my partner I'm starting to slip and he just tells me I'll be fine. 
Will I be?

Her loss wasn't completely unexpected but devastating , nonetheless . I did seek counselling and it did help . 12 months on , I met and fell in love with a wonderful woman and fell madly in love with her .She had her demons but we were happy . A couple of Saturdays ago , her elderly mother passed away and she took it terribly . 3 days later she was rushed to emergency , and while very unwell , not in my worst nightmare did I imagine her , too , passing away . Totally unexpected , and I am so lost and broken . Has anyone else suffered the loss of two life partners and how the hell do you cope . Cheers in advance for any advice

Hi 
I have a beautiful 14 month old baby girl and just lost my second baby girl due to kidney problems. I had a very difficult pregnancy and birth in both cases and my first baby has hip dyslasia and so has had procedures and hip spica cast and is still requiring treatment. After losing my second baby there is a large possibility that I might not be able to carry a third child. I am physically and emotionally unwell and feel like this is affecting my relationships especially with my husband  as well as the way I raise and take care of my daughter. I'm just reaching out to anyone who may have experienced something similar and what helped them cope and manage everyday life and accepting what happened. I have very supportive parents but at times I feel like everyone has their own lives to deal with. 
Thankyou for taking the time to read what I've experienced.

Hi all, 
Im not sure if I'm posting in the right category, but in 2009 I lost my nan, at that time I was only 9 and so I didn't really understand what was happening. But I remember everything like it was yesterday. Since I've become older and more mature I've started to understand things better and I really wish I hadn't have. This is due to the loss of my nan (8 years ago) taking a massive toll on me in this current day and age. I'm really unsure how to cope with it. 
 
The reason I feel I'm so upset about it is because, 

My nan was my bestfriend
i was so close with her
its taken me this long to actually feel anything.

I'm currently in year 12 and everything's becoming more and more stressful. I can't talk to my parents or siblings about my nan because it hurts them as much as it hurts me. Is it normal to think ""am I doing the right thing?"" I've gone to a psychologist but she couldn't help me.

Hey Guys. am new to the Forum. Have suffered Depression most of my life & diagnosed with BiPolar about 10 years ago. Medication mix has been great & I've been coping with Life etc well.  Wednesday this week, 2nd August, is the 1st Anniversary of my Mother's Death. it was a strained relationship, with lots of verbal abuse over many years.  She was a negative, nasty person in her final years, mainly brought about by my Father leaving her after 47 odd years of marriage. (He became the biggest bastard in the world as she continued to be negative) She was a control freak, like her mother before her, & because I did what She did, break the rules & become a stronger person & live my life the way I wanted to, including giving up 2 careers because she took control & manipulated a situation & took my kids off me back in the early 80's,  I was the worst person in the world. My brother & my son were the shining lights in her life as she was a product of her generation & very much a male orientated person. Us Girls were always in trouble etc. all the bloody time.... so after looking after her in her last months, getting her the care she needed & into an aged care facility, visiting every day etc, the final logical thing she said to was abuse. she died 4 days later.  My brother, sis in law & I were all with her as she passed quietly & peacefully, for which I am thankful. 
I am in such a mess with my thoughts. I'm very flat, after being so good for so long, I'm not sleeping, I'm writing down what I can i n my diary. Trying to keep busy & do things around the house, looking after my daughter & the kids as well at the moment.   it's Star Trek Sunday at the moment so I'm distracting myself with my Star Trek as well. 
I would welcome Ideas of how to cope over the next few days.  I hope I can take on board your suggestions. 
Keep well, people. Peace & Long LIfe.

Hi everyone,

I've never written on a forum before so I hope I'm doing it correctly. 

I'm a 47 yr old female with a long history of depression and social anxiety. I‚Äôm in a relationship with someone I believe has Aspergers. He
displays many of those traits, in particular an astounding lack of empathy. We‚Äôve been together for just under 2 years. We‚Äôve been living
together for 4 months.

3 months ago my little brother suddenly passed away. Last weekend my father was diagnosed with aggressive terminal cancer. The one thing
I need right now is empathy. While I love my partner, his inability to accept that I'm in a lot of pain is destroying that love. I find myself avoiding going home because I just don't want to deal with it. I want to move out but everyone I talk to says I shouldn't make any rash decisions at this
point in time. My question is - how do I stay where I am when things are only going to get more painful for me? I'm fearful that keeping the status quo is only going to cause another mental breakdown and this is the very last thing my mother needs.

Thoughts and suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.

Hi
My husband suicided 17mths ago and I am trying to help my children deal with their grief but struggle myself. I have 4 daughters, 3 still at home. We all still have trouble understanding his suicide and go through times of depression but I really worry about them. The youngest spends so much time by herself in her room and only seems to enjoy watching YouTube videos. A week ago she told her friends she wanted to kill herself.
 My 15yr old has OCD and was diagnosed before his death but now her anxieties are consuming her. She doesn't sleep very well and mostly sleeps with me. Sometimes she can't eat breakfast because she is too anxious about going to school. She won't eat much at school either and then binges in the afternoon because she is hungry. 
My 17yr old seems to be doing OK at the moment but she gets quite depressed too. A few months after her Dad's death she said she thought suicide was inevitable for her. 
My oldest is getting married in 3 weeks but she is unhappy sometimes and can't say why. I also worry that her fianc√© has some anger/control issues. He is a nice guy and has been very supportive of her but I have seen him try to physically restrain her when she is upset and he has left bruises when he holds her. 
 I know this is a lot and I know that there is no quick solutions but I was hoping for some advice to try and some moral support. I am not doing so good myself and would appreciate some positive thoughts from others. 
Thanks

Hi, Beyond Blue. I am an extremely smart and popular student from a great middle class family.
I am, also, an emotionally unstable bisexual alcoholic (or close to becoming one), who can not miss a chance to take something stronger than liqour to kill the pain and void, which I often feel since I was 13, or to make my anomalously high level of unreasonable happiness even higher.
Around two weeks ago, while experiencing that ""anomalously high level of unreasonable happiness"", I learned that my... friend... commited suicide. We did not talk for over than a year, because of some argument. And, actually, she was probably the person to which my feelings were closest to ""love"".
At first couple of days these news went pretty unnoticed to me. It did not matter much to me, as I was completing each of my difficult assignemnts, which usually take me ages to finish, in less than 3 hours, partying, having great time with my lover. Then, however, the realisation have started coming down on me. Instead of the study, that I planned for one evening, I broke up with my lover over the phone, went to the club, danced, drank excessive amounts of alcohol, had sex with another guy, who I knew just for 15 minutes. In another couple of days as my maniacal happiness was continuing I was continuing to party, consume drugs and engaging in risky behavior, still trying to hide those news.
As that time, as everythig good, came to an end, and I returned to having a normal, but slow, life. Still, however, I was trying not to think about what two days ago dropped me into this void of drunken misery.
I regret so much. I regret that we were not together this year and last. Hell, I don't know what to do, and even my abuse of alcohol doesn't get me out of this mess for even, at least, a couple of hours.

My darling of 28 yrs recently passed away from Leukaemia. He had 7 ish months of chemo, copped an absolute flogging and just kept hacking it. He was an absolute hero throughout.Nearly died 3 times.
We knew it'd come back but not as quick as it did. He got about 5 wks back home and was told he had less than a month to live. Imagine hearing that.¬†

It's really hard. I miss him terribly. Can't fully comprehend he's not coming back.¬†
We were happy and lucky to have each other but that's hard to think about atm.¬†
The mind's an amazing thing and protects you from the pain.¬†
I have Bipolar so that certainly gives me a dose of pain when on the down side.¬†
I've seen small changes in the grieving process.(Moving through).¬†
Got good friends but sometimes it's just too hard to fathom or want to for that matter.¬†
Love him sooo much.¬†

Hi,
My husband committed suicide and I would like to know if there are any organisations helping the victims. Because with every suicide there is far more victims left behind with the potential of depression to follow. My husband was hospitalized twice and not once did the hospital call me in to talk to them about what was going on at home and warning me of possible warning signs. I tried with the psychiatrist and he was not interested in anything but medication. He did not visit the home once. His psychologist appointed by the hospital told me when I rang him the day he died that he could not get Michael to talk. (Drrrrr). He did not ask me how I was, he just got defensive. His GP said that he should of had shock treatment when I called her. NO ONE ask how I or my children were going. I am looking after myself with regular physiologist's help. I have done that on my own. I have looked on both The Black Dog website and Beyond blue and there is nothing there. I was wondering if there are any others out there like myself.I would love to be able to talk to someone with the same experience with the suicide of there partner.

Hi everyone 
I'm new here and this is my first post. 
I was diagnosed with bipolar ii disorder in November 2016.
My mum has just had exploratory surgery where a large inoperable tumour mass was found. It's believed to be secondary breast cancer which she battled 7 years ago. We are currently awaiting pathology results to see how and if it can be treatment. In any case she won't survive this but hopefully buy some time. 
Im very close to my mum except for last year where she didn't understand mental health and I kept my distance and never told her my diagnosis as I knew she wouldn't cope with it. 
I feel sad for the arguments we had and the lost time. I feel responsible for it all and my illness and I'm angry I got sick. I was very suicidal and incorrectly treatment with antidepressants which made things a when lot worse. 
I'm lucky to be alive and my mum doesn't know the half of it. I don't regret keeping it from her but believe I should have handled it better and kept a better relationship with her. I feel guilt as now my time is limited with her. 
I've been medicated since December slowly increasing on an anti epileptic which is good for BP ii. I finally got to the correct dose in February and things have been better and more stable. Combined with counselling. 
But I haven't been able to sleep with my mind racing and I just randomly cry and go from crying to focussed that we can fight this. I feel confused and I don't know if this is normal or whether the bp ii is making my moods go all over the place. 
I don't know if this is triggering issues and I don't know how I'm going to cope with this. 
I have two little boys under 6 and not working as I gave up my career last year when I got sick but was hoping to return to it this year. I can't afford to fall apart for their sake. 
 Anyone help Me? 
 Thank you x

My father, who was also my best friend, passed away suddenly just over a week ago. We have been extremely close since my mother passed away from cancer when I was 18. The ambulance I called was unable to get to him as his house is hard to access, I ended up finding him unresponsive, they said it was a heart attack. He has a long and complicated medical history and has survived a heart attack before. I am having flashbacks to finding him and trying to wake him and am experiencing extreme feelings of guilt for not getting to him soon enough, I had spoken to him a few hours earlier and he said he was short of breath and to see if he could move his doctor's appointment a few days earlier, they couldn't and said if he should go to hospital, he said he would see how he went, I kept calling him every 20 minutes and he eventually said he would get ready to go to hospital and call me back. He didn't and I couldn't get a hold of him so I called and told the ambulance to go there. I feel that I should have known how serious it was and ignored him telling me he was ok and just got them there earlier, I was at work about half an hour away on the train which is why it took me awhile to get to him. I miss him so much and whilst my husband (who was also very close to my dad) is being amazing, my mentally disabled sister who was in my dad's care has come to live with us and he is great with her, I can't see how I will ever feel ok again and be able to move on. It feels like a piece of me has died with him. I am seeing a counsellor on Tuesday but just wanted to speak to someone who knows how I feel before then as I'm really not coping. Thanks

Recently I lost my mother (my best friend) to a horrible suicide and to make it worse she this was her second attempt but this one left me completed blind. We spoke everyday and I thought we were confiding to each other about everything and I thought she was finally staring to get the help she needed. She was diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and was prone to rapid mood swings and also unfortunately like many, was a drinker (wine or whatever she could get her hands on). I'm at the stage that I keep blaming myself for missing the signs and for not being there to prevent it happening. I tried so hard to help her but she refused to admit there was a problem on any count - she experienced a hard life and at one stage was put on anti depression tablets - unsure if correct dosage but with drinking I guess that's hard to know. But basically I can't make sense of her passing and am struggling to do the most basic things in my own life. I just miss her so intently and and feel like I'm in a million pieces but half my soul has gone. I'm just unable to cope with the grief and was wandering if anyone who has gone through something similar can offer me advice on how to deal immediately? I am waiting on professional grief counselling but I'm also scared that I too may have the disorder as I sense I am changing and rational thoughts are rare. If any one can other some words of wisdom - please help xo

I'm only a kid, last year in October I drove to my friends house for a sleepover with mum but mum didn't get back home. She got hit by two underage 15/17 year old boys that did a hit and run but were driving 60km over the speed limit. Mums car then got blown up into flames and she died straight away at the scene. I feel so sad since and don't know how to feel. Also my mum was and always will be my bestfriend I told her everything. She put everyone first and herself very far second, very loyal, happy, and funny lady that I adore so much. In 2015 she also tried committing suicide so was in hospital for over 9 months getting therapy. She only just conquered that horrible experience and for this to happen its ruin my families lives completely.
WHAT TO DO NOW... I DONT KNOW :(

Hi everyone, I am struggling right now. My mum passed away 5 weeks ago and I have become the carer for my Autistic sister. She is in respite care but I have a long list of things to do with the house and my sister. My dad passed away 12 years ago so I am it!!  I thought I was coping ok till this week. My doc says that I am mentally paralysed, my mind is racing at a thousand miles an hour but I can't do anything or make a decision. 
Yesterday I was getting my two kids ready for school and my heart started racing and I started panicking. The last two days I can't seem to calm my heart down. It feels like I am running a race. I imagine I am having a panic attack but I dont know as I have never had one before. I am so scared of doing anything and making decisions. My husband is wonderful but I can also see he is getting frustrated at me. I am lost and don't know where to turn. I wake up crying in the middle of the night and all I want to do is hide away. I know this is not normal but right now I have to hide, hiding feels normal. I know I am in a hole but everyone is telling me to move ahead slowly. I just want to stay here..not move and cry. I am hoping people on here have felt the same.

Last year my sister decided to take her life, leaving behind a newborn behind.
It's been over half a year and I don't think I have made any progress with feeling, understanding or processing what has happened.
Of late, there have been waves of confusion and disbelief. Which I can know can be expected, but it doesn't make it any easier.
The husbands family have been open and welcoming with us to come and visit, spending time with baby, which we deeply appreciate.
It's with the tiny moments in between everything that I find to be most confronting. That feeling that we, as family to the child, play a disconnected role, one that feels like distant cousins that show up once a year, with no real influence or care for the child. With attempts at feeding, changing or taking a more active role sometimes brushed to the side or overseen.
 I guess I can see it's still early days, and that the husband and family are clutching onto baby as it's all he has left, but what about us?
Baby is our only connection to who we have lost. What are the politics and processes for such a complicated situation?
What I see immediately is that we need to saturate, just to get close and make the impression that we are here, and we want a more active role.

Hello.
sorry I'm a new member and if I've posted this in the wrong place, moderators please feel free to remove this.
I lost a best friend three months ago due to suicide, unfortunately I found him after he had taken his life. 
I live in a small community and the support I've received is amazing but I'm yet to open up about how I'm feeling, simply because I don't know how to feel. I've completely avoided coming to terms with what has happened and I've put all my energy into making sure everyone else around me is dealing with it.
recently another close friend has been self harming and the thought of losing her is keeping me awake at night. It's draining me. 
my question is, has anyone got any advice or tips that'll help me get back to my normal self. I know it won't be an easy process but I need to do something. 
 I'm sorry if I've triggered or offended anyone. 
Thank you.

Well Im feeling really down and depressed and my mind has been so focused on the one thing today its starting to make my head spin. You see today would have been my beautiful Dads Birthday he would have been 91 years old, but sadly he passed away 6 years ago. My Dad was my best friend we used to have the best conversations about all kinds of things,we made wonderful memories together, but it breaks my heart I miss him so much, I still talk to him in my mind daily, I have photos of him all around the house, I remember he used to double me on his mobility scooter.
So as hard a day its been for me I've just tried to relive the good times
I was with him when he passed away and we got to tell each other how much we loved each other
So rest in peace my beautiful Dad and Happy Birthday
Love Annie

I wasn't sure where to post about this. It didn't seem to fit in any of the categories 
 i recently lost my dog in a tragic accident. He was much more than a dog to me he was everything. I am single and live alone, he was my whole life. He gave my life purpose for the first time.
I rescued him from a horrible life and we only had 4 and a half short months together. He made me so incredibly happy, happier than I have ever been I have never loved anyone or anything the way that I loved him. I'm just hurting so much. Constantly feeling like I don't want to live without him and fighting so hard to keep going. 
 i have so much support around me but it just isn't helping. I feel lost and empty and I just don't know how to cope 
 i have always had depression and right now I just feel like I am at rock bottom. I can't even function, even though I have sought professional help from a doctor and a psychologist. I'm struggling so much

After reading a post in the Dr Kim's section and the scriber was talking about a colleague committing suicide after losing their job. They spoke about writing a letter to the employer about things that were going on, also policy/procedures issues and should they be afraid of losing their job.
I feel making issues relating to policy and procedure is vital for a company, it is great to make improvements for employers and employees. If it could be done in a manner where there is no finger pointing or blame even better. I feel if i was going to write a letter like this, i feel it could be more beneficial done by a group of staff representatives so they know how staff are feeling on certain issues. Talk to other employees to gather other feedback on the issues you are going to put forward to your employer.
It is a very sad thing to lose someone you know or work with to suicide and my believe is that we as a whole need to be more in tune to how people present at different times also approaching someone if they seem out of character. If employers are not this way the employees could create an environment that is made to feel people could approach others before things become too heavy for them.
What are others opinion on this subject?

I lost my dad last year and the 1 year of his fathers is creeping up and I'm feeling more and more anxious. I don't want to work, see people or even get out of bed at times. I'm struggling and over eating, not exercising much and self doubting myself constantly. I recently got work and then stopped due to feeling I couldn't do it. I just want to feel normal again. The only thing keeping me going is my dog and new partner.¬†

I am really struggling to cope with the loss of my beautiful Grandpa's. My Paternal Pop passed away in April and my Maternal Pop in June. They were both living with me and my family at the time and gained their wings as they slept, which has compounded my grief. I am trying to focus on the fact they have both reunited with their soul mates, my beautiful Nana's, but it only provides so much comfort.
The constant talk of their estates and the knowledge that their houses will be sold by years end and most likely knocked down makes me feel I have lost them all, all over again. It nearly broke me the first time.
With us recently having our first Father's Day with out them, and various heartbreaking days ahead; their birthdays coming up in November and December, the anniversaries, especially the 7 month anniversary of my Paternal Pop's passing (which happens to fall on the 17 year anniversary of my Paternal Nana's passing and the 5 month anniversary of the day we laid my Maternal Pop to rest), our first Christmas without them and our last at my Paternal Grandparents home and then starting the new year, with them in heaven instead of here with us.
It is all too much.
We aren't just dealing with our grief though; my parents, older sister and I are all dealing with health issues, my father is going through legal proceedings with work (from which he retired 2 years ago), my brother is living at our Grandparents house and is dealing with having to find a new home and I lost my job in May.
I want to be there for them through everything but I can't even help myself. I feel so alone and am struggling to hold it together.
I love my Grandparents so much and miss them beyond words.

Hi, I am new here. 
 Two weeks ago I lost my dear friend and mentor, my Grandmother. We were incredibly close and I had been heavily involved in her care until she passed. Before the funeral I just felt like a robot- going through all the processes, supporting my dad, helping with funeral arrangements. After the funeral, it hit me really hard and now I don't know what to do. I am still incredibly upset but it's like no one cares anymore, as in, now the funeral is over the grieving is meant to be finished?? Or I'm meant to be 'over it'? 
I don't know what is normal. I think about her almost every minute, I choke up at the thought I can never see her again. I am holding it all in as I feel like no one wants to hear it anymore. 
I don't know what to do.

Hi,Almost two weeks ago my father committed suicide.I spent the first couple of days tearing everything apart trying to find answers to questions that werent always important; finding out his last movements, if it was planned for some time.I accepted a lot of the questions werent important and i let them go.There was a lot of family drama i was caught between up until the funeral. During the funeral, i barely shed a tear and i feel like i just dont care. In my head i know he is gone but im not sure i know that in my body. Im really confused by how i feel.I considered viewing the body but chose not to, but now i think it may have helped me?Will it come out eventually? How will itt come out? Any information would be appreciated.

A few weeks ago my brothers fience died. He move back home with us (parents and I),and im feeling overwhelmed.
I've  been suffering major depression for 15 years; I'm agoraphobic, have social anxiety, and schizotypal PD. I'm a loner, highly sensitive to exteral stimulus (sounds, sights, smells etc.). I need complete isolation in order to unwind, which I usually have my own space. But now my brother has moved in and I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown. 
 I don't want to take away from his loss but I am not coping. I'm becoming snappish, highly agitated and relying on anti anxietys too much. 
My parents are under huge stess, they're picking up the slack for everything. I can't add to that. But i am not coping. 
How do I tell my grieving brother to leave me alone and get out of my personal space?

This is my first post. 
Today I discovered my friend took his life two days ago. He had been battling for a while with custody issues with his ex wife. He's seen his kids a total of 2 days this year.  I guess it got too much for him. 
As we'd both been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts, we made a pact that we'd call each other if either of us got to that dark place.  He didn't call.
I'm feeling a range of things but one emotion that concerns me is envy. I find myself wishing I had the courage to go through with it. 
I know I need help but I don't know what to say. I've had counselling but I'm very hard on myself and tend to scoff at people trying to justify my feelings. I don't know what I'm expecting but just thought I should put something out there.

I lost my little brother 6 years ago at the age of 17 to suicide. The only thing we know about the reasons why, is all hearsay. No notes, signs or anything. I do think anything he use to do, as a family we related that to possibilities of why he done it. It is still a touchy subject in my family so obviously I can't talk to family about it in full detail. Unanswered questions have been just as constant in my mind to this day. I now have children but I can't fully be focused on them because I'm always thinking about my brother. I know I'm a good mum but I'm not giving my kids 100% I'd say I'm giving them 90% of my all. Which is unfair. I tried harming myself 3 days after his death. I stopped because I was too scared. No one ever knew or knows. I went back to my family and we continued with our farewells to him. I've struggled with my weight since his death and I feel so much more depressed when weight has piled on. I don't know how to control my weight now. There is still blame and confusion on my part. It's been 6 years of having this in my head. I'm appreciative to have finally let this out. Thank you for reading.

On 22nd July my Dad knocked my Mum with the car in their drive, she hit her head & died the next morning.  I KNOW it was an accident, but feel guilty that I ""let"" my Dad still be driving at 87 (he was cleared by a Dr to drive two weeks prior) My hubby and I were 300km from home for a much-needed break (I was feeling depressed) We got ""the phone call"" & drove home immediately, half way home we got a call saying there was no hope, Mum would certainly die.  My heart broke, ""not my beautiful Mum"" My sister (who usually lives 400km away) happened to be up, was on her way home actually when she got a call Mum had managed to dial, she called an ambulance & saw Mum just as she was leaving, she was conscious then, by the time my sis got to hospital Mum had lost consciousness, she never woke again.  I live less than 2km from Mum and Dad and keep thinking ""what if I hadn't been away"" ""at least I would have had the chance to talk to her, if only for a minute.
Mum was my best friend; I spoke to her at least once every day and saw her at least three times a week.  She & Dad shared much of our lives. Mum and I had a lot in common, she was my support person.  She said little about how my Dad's memory was failing but it was obvious that it was becoming a problem.  I told her how worried I was about her dying first and what to do about Dad, he and I were not close, okay but not close
My Dad's dementia has spiralled since her death, he can't be left alone, cries a lot & is very difficult; cantankerous, even aggressive.  I have done all those ""things"" you have to do when someone dies; undoing my Mum's life file number by licence number was hard!. I try to stay ""up"" to counter Dad's ""down"" and he accuses me of not caring.... when I am home alone I am in pieces.  I am now my Dad's PoA and running his house as well as ours & our business.  My sis (retired) is staying with him for now; her home and partner are too far away for it to continue long term.  We can afford a nice nursing home, but he is very resistant.  Also I KNOW that once he is in a place, my sis will go home and the visiting and care (Dr visits etc) will all fall to me, & I've done more than my""share"" over the years, 
I am saddest that I can't grieve for Mum with all the worry and ""doing"" for Dad taking my time & energy... I am sad too that I resent my Father for being so needy, I know it's unreasonable but when he says it would be best that he die all I can think is, ""it would"" or if I did.. I am very down

I am being slammed by complex grief.My father was an extremely abusive man, a depressed narcissist in fact that terrorised his wife and kids.He took his own life 6 years ago.My grief has been protracted because life wasn't polite and didn't give me space to grieve straight away like other people can. I had to hold up my traumatised Mum who has a psychotic illness, quit my job, leave my friends to ensure she didn't go the same way. When I was little I was certain it would be her to do it - but I was wrong.12 months later our Nana died. And then 9 months later Mum's best friend died, who was my ""earth mother"" that looked after me when I was little whenever Mum was hospitalised. Everyone was gone.I am haunted by my fathers death. Haunted.He was so abusive.............................but he was my Dad.

I miss my father in law.  He represented the goodness and humanity of a man who encouraged community.  He reminds me that Father's Day is about good men.  His son, my husband is also an exceptional man and a wonderful father.  He has survived and endures living with me and my ongoing fight with my past.  I struggle to get through Father's Day, but I suck in my grief for my wonderful husband and our incredible children.  I see them and am reminded that I must focus on the beauty of life now as it should be.  But I am miserable and I am furious. In the 10 years my husband has been a father, he knows of my struggle and that just ruins his day.  He lost his dad 6 years ago and that just ruins his day.  I have let him be cheated of what is rightfully his, what he has truly earned.  A wonderful and meaningful Father's Day.  I am sickened and revolted by thoughts that my childhood rape gave a paedophile 11 Father's Day's.  I am heartbroken for the beautiful people in my life who are affected by the pain that I let out and I hate myself so much for letting my past affect those I love.  I realize now that I can't move on because I don't know where he is and it angers me that he continues to celebrate Father's Day.  Why is he not dead?  Why do I let him ruin Father's Day for my beautiful gentle husband? How do I push all his ugly aside and make space for someone who truly deserves it?  Help me

I don't want sympathy but I feel like I haven't had the easiest of lives! There is a family history of depression and I have also lost a sister to cancer, my father to suicide, a child who was stilborn, a brother in a road accident and a very close friend to cancer. The last two within the last two months! I am a firm believer in life goes on (not in a heartless way) but sometimes I feel like I should be cut some slack! My husband seems so cold, like I just make excuses for not cleaning! I believe I am depressed but I have been like this my whole life, on and off medication, so I just keep doing what needs to be done... I finally found a job that I look forward. I'm not perfect! I'm not the most motivated person but I think I do my best... I don't even know what I am asking, I just wish I had someone who understood that I'm not lazy! I'm just tired! I'm tired of losing people! I'm tired of being afraid of talking about it because I think people will think I'm fishing for sympathy or not believe me.. I Just wish he knew... Thank you

Hi all,
My father passed away nearly 4 weeks ago, we had been estranged for well over 15 years, with the last time we actually spoke being a negative experience for us both. I was told by a family member 2 days before he passed away that he was not doing well and had been moved to palliative care. It was at this point that I decided to go see him before he passed on, as he had no other family around him (he wasn't known for maintaining relationships) and I didn't want him to pass on without saying my goodbyes. I drove the 3 hours from my home to where has was, the drive seemed like an eternity with a million things rushing through my head, as well as emotions I didn't expect to feel given the time that had passed and the relationship we had. I stayed with him at the hospital until he passed away from lung and heart failure. Witnessing a man who was also so strong struggle to breathe, was definitely the most confronting and overwhelming thing I have ever done in my life. Even now I'm still feelings overwhelmed but still somewhat numb by seeing that.The numbness finally gave way to sadness, further complicated by the fact he had to will, no funeral plan etc. I am the youngest of 4 children, 3 (including myself) are still alive, I was left to handle everything from trying to sort out his financial and legal obligations to making the funeral arrangements and paying for them also. I have received nothing but abuse from one of my older siblings for doing all of the above, meanwhile no one else was doing anything.
So needless to say, the death of my father has caused a lot of grief, sadness and massive feelings of being overwhelmed. Just when I think I am going okay with everything, I often feel this crushing weight of emotions that I can't even begin to describe. I know it is very early days but please someone tell me if gets easier. I feel broken on a daily basis.

Hi all,
 I would consider myself a mentally well adjusted person in general. I lost my father who lives overseas to a sudden cardiac arrest on July 16th of this year. I went home for the funeral, and to help mum sort out his affairs, and came back to australia about three weeks after that. I was very close to my father (I was his first born and a daddy's girl), and losing him at the age of 66 (I am 32) was crap. No other way to put it. After the initial horrible crying all the time of the first three weeks, I tried to pull myself together and sunk myself into work and the gym, rather than wallowing in it. I have a dog and found that walking him was very therapeutic. My partner is from country vic and a bit of a blokes bloke, so I know that emotional support can be limited.
 Last night, as I was putting clothes away in our bedroom, I saw a jumper of dads. It just hit me then, and I couldnt control the tears. I quickly went to my office as I didn't want to bawl in front of my partner, I am pretty private in general with this, even with him. I had a good cry and went back to the bedroom where he was reading the news in bed, but couldnt shake the feeling of sadness. I said to my partner that I was feeling shit, and that I missed my father, and that I tried not to be a debbie downer by going and crying it out in my office but I still couldnt shake it. He looked at me and said ""you have been a debbie downer for the last 3 months, I'm tired of your shit. First world problems, you need to get over it, theres people with bigger problems!"" 
I was aghast. He stabbed his finger at me as he talked, his face contorted. He had bigger problems than me he said, but when I asked him what they were he told me that he wouldn't tell me as I was useless! Then he stomped off to the spare bedroom.
 So here I am. I'm being told to get over my fathers death like its the death of a cat, and I have a partner who is a dickhead. I feel shit. Just writing it all out to get it out. Thanks for reading.

Nick died tragically early in January 2015. He was 22 years of age. Nick was part of the usual less than perfect family; with brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends and various others who loved and confused him with equal measure.As a child Nick was diagnosed as having ADHD and later this was clarified as Asperger's syndrome. This meant that Nick's experience of the world was more confusing than for most of us, as the analytical stream of his brain and the emotional stream were less interconnected.He was to experience learning difficulties, his parents' divorce, his mother dying much too soon, having to take what work might be offered and various tribulations of life.Nick had a powerful memory. Before he started school he could name each of the Thomas-The-Tank-Engines. But while he could place one or two of his toy trains away in his toy box, when faced with too many he was unable to comprehend a solution. As an adolescent Nick mastered catching after back-flipping at trapeze.He had abundant patience, which he drew on when working as a personal care attendant. He cooked meals for his brothers and father. Nick enjoyed drawing, as did his grandfather and great-grandfather who shared a family curse of depression. Nick could be maddening to live with; he might tidy up but not completely, staying up late and expressing decided opinions. He often preferred activities that were familiar, with people he knew; especially his brothers and cousins.He joined a drawing group at a burlesque club, and few months ago went to the Russian Film Festival, with musicians, dancers, vodka shots and pretty girls. Nick had sought medical advice on his own initiative about the increased anxiety he was experiencing. He took the prescription medication he was prescribed. He accepted a referral to a clinical psychologist and did not miss any appointments.Nick had also enrolled in a TAFE course in bakery. He had not been shy about early hours, hard work.We cannot know what was in Nick's mind on the evening he died and why he so hastened into this good night. His family is earnestly reflected on how we might have better supported Nick.Nick is buried with his mother.Breichiau mam sy'n dynn amdanat(Mother's arms are tight around you).

Hi all,
14th of July 2015 , my best friend in this world died. My mum was 66yrs old. We found out in December 2014 two weeks before Xmas that she had cancer. I thought that was the worst day of my life, but when she got an appointment with the oncologist in late January 2015 we were told it was terminal . She did chemo to buy some time but I feel it didn't really help. I took care of her and never left her side,I was so distraught at the prospect of her dying. I cried every single day ,I  tried to be strong but couldn't. Eventually it went to her brain an no more treatment was an option,so she was sent home to die.we had hospice come in when needed. I watched the woman that I loved with every fibre of my being die .
I'm 42 years old and I'm severely agarophobic along with other anxiety issues. My brother is 45 and schizophrenic and we both live in our family home. We have no other family, my father has never been part of our lives even tho he is alive and well. In February this year I had a heart attack and was in hospital for three days,the same hospital I spent so much time at with my mum. I begged them to let me die if I had another heart attack, I just want to be with my mum. They sent a psychiatrist to see me in hospital and diagnosed me with major depressive disorder. I feel so alone even tho I know others are going through the same. I am a mess and truly wish everyday I could join my mum.
Thanks for listening.

Hi, I lost my mum suddenly to a heart attack a year ago and I was actually the one to find her in bed. She had been gone for a couple of hours which even in my shock I could comprehend, but regardless I had to follow the 000 instructions and attempt to resuscitate her until the ambulance arrived. I'm obviously grieving but it's the trauma of this event that is what I find most disturbing. I have the normal things that obviously trigger sad emotions... Anniversarys, birthdays etc but I find that it takes me back to resuscitating her, seeing her lifeless body, not to the loving, joyful memories of her and my child hood. I just relive the emotions of that day. Has anyone else been through something similar? Is this normal? It still haunts me and I think I need to talk about it more. Sometimes it builds up and I end up having an emotional purge... ie: crying/sobbing for hours until I'm exhausted and fall asleep. I do have a loving support network around me but I'm still traumatised by this. I'd like to better understand what's happening to me, maybe if anyone else has experianced this or similar it may help knowing I'm not thinly one. Maybe there's some good advice out there? I hope so.

I recently lost my mom who I was very close to. We were best friends and shared a lifetime of experiences. Losing her is the toughest experience I have ever had to face. If it was that alone I know I would eventually learn to live with her loss but for now it is very raw. To complicate my journey I am trying to cope with my husband who had been suffering depression for a long time and has not been able to provide much support. Because of his illness we have almost no friends and family rarely visit. He refuses all help and rarely tells me what he is thinking. I can't lean on him as my not coping is making him worse. I feel quite trapped.

Hi all, 
I have never posted in anything like this before but i just really need to pour my heart out. 
I lost my beautiful sister 8 weeks ago. She was 31. She died suddenly due to an accident. We were extremely close and spoke multiple times a day. We shared everything and she is a huge part of who i am. 
I replay the morning she died over and over in my head. I will never forget it. 
I miss her terribly. I ache for her. I don't want to get out of bed anymore. I cry all day. I think of her constantly. I don't know how to live without her. 
She didnt want to die. I feel so awful for her.  She would be devasted this happened to her. I want to protect her and i can't. I should of prevented this happening somehow. She was too important to be gone. 
I have 3 kids and i go through the motions every day but i have lost the best part of me. I feel sick that i am young and have to live through this for a long time. It cant be real. 
I talk to her all day. I write to her constantly. Of course she never responds. So many things we shared. So many things that only she would understand. ...its all lost. 
No one loves me like she does. No one understands me like she does. I just want this pain to go away and for her to speak to me. 
I dont know what to do anymore.

Hi all,
 I lost my fiancee on our Wedding Day  Feb 2015 before we were married, we were both 24 at the time. Flash forward 18 months and I'm back at work doing well, I have friends and family who love me, but I feel so lost and don't know how to talk to anyone about it. I'm lonely and sad and find it hard to relate to anyone my own age in and out of relationships as I don't know anyone my age who has been through the same thing as me. I feel like I have to be strong too, it's just part of who I am, but I am sick of being strong... I suppose I am looking for someone to relate to, someone who understands... 
Happy and open to talk.. any help would be appreciated.
 Thank you in advance

Today has been the worst for my mental health. Being referred to a psychologist tomorrow to talk about everything. 
I've recently lost 2 babies due to miscarriage and its the only thing in my mind. I can't describe how I feel. Nobody I know understands. 
I'm too scared to go into the shops cause I'll break down crying. Even going for a simple blood test plays on my mind. I don't know what to do.

Aurora Jane mason: not one day has gone by that I haven't thought of you. I remember the day before you were born I was a total mess stressing over everything and nothing, people were telling me that this will be the most memorable moment of my life! hearing your own baby girl cry out for the first time.
So six years ago today daddy finished work and rushed to meet you and mummy at the hospital, full of pride for the first time I was so excited too meet you. 
But the entire floor was quite when I got there and all I could hear were heartbroken cries and tears,still born is what they told me. Daddy is so sorry he wasn't there, daddy is so sorry that he never got too hear your first scream, daddy is sorry he didn't have the strength to stay in the hospital with you and mum and ran off! 
I will always remember your ethereal face though my baby for the rest of my life! And your life which was taken from you will continue to play out in my dreams... It is the price I pay for living while you are no longer here.
Love always and forever Dad xox

3 weeks ago my family and I lost my dad to cancer after a 2 year battle. My mum was his primary carer and also my absolute hero. Seeing him in so much pain was terrible but his passing has given us some comfort he is no longer in pain. I live alone but spent several weeks with my family. Now I am back home and getting back into work it literally does not feel real. I feel like I don't cry enough. I do have some moments where I break down but then soon after I feel better. It seems to come in waves. Living alone with not much of a social life is hard, and I do spend as much time with my family during this time but also understand we need our own space too. This is the first time I have experienced loss.

Hi,
I am new to forums and this is my first ever post. I'm not sure what I am hoping for but two years ago I lost my mum very quickly and unexpectedly. Then in January this year mum's husband passed away. His death stired up the loss of mum again and I thought losing mum was the hardest lost I would ever have to endure - I was wrong! Five weeks after my stepfather died my son passed away. That phone call was my worse nightmare coming true and after the autopsy to find out his death could have been prevented if the people he was staying with would have called for medical assistance makes it all that much worse. I am trying to find a balance with my youngest son, I am trying to not smother him but I don't want him to feel as though I am not always there for him either. Myself, I am totally lost and can't find any enthusiasm to do anything and have been off work since my son died. If anyone has gone through something similar or even lost a child, I could really use any words of wisdom. I feel like I'm in a downward spiral and can't seem to get a grip on my way down. I know my life has changed forever and I am not ever going to be the same person but I don't know how to get through this. My children have always been my life.

Hi everyone,This is my very first post here. I decided to come here, because i feel so lost right now. I literally feel numb, i cry all the time, i can't sleep properly.A little about my background: I was diagnosed with severe depression in November 2010, and was on medication. I felt fine, and i believe that it was really helping me to recover. However, i found out that i was pregnant in Feb 2011. I had to stop my anti-d's due to high risk of heart defects in the baby. So i stopped, and i managed to cope somehow.After she was born, i was fine. Fast forward to 2013, we became pregnant with our second. My world came crashing down when our 12 week test came back as positive for trisomy 21 (downs). We decided not to terminate, and we waited until our baby was born. She was born without trisomy 21.It's now 2016, and we decided to start trying for our 3rd baby in late 2015. We fell pregnant in march 2016, and had all the usual tests. All was good. I had my first scan on April the 1st, and they discovered a molar pregnancy. I had a d&c on April the 4th, and I've been having weekly blood tests since then to measure my beta hcg levels. They found a 12 week old baby when the d&c was performed, we thought we were only 7 weeks along; so we decided to cremate the baby.With a molar pregnancy, you need to have regular tests to make sure the hcg levels are coming down. If not, it can be a sign of retained tissue, persistent gestational trophoblastic disease (which needs chemo) or choriocarcinoma (Spreads to the lungs, and other organs. also needs chemo)So not only had we lost our baby, we found out that our baby was older; and we also had a risk of developing cancer. Losing your baby is bad enough, let alone finding out that you may have cancer.My levels were dropping like they were meant to, until may the 1st. From 979 they jumped to 2800, on may the 9th they jumped to 8,000. I'm devastated, i just want to feel better again; be better again. I feel like with everything that has been going on, I've not had a chance to grieve properly.I feel angry. Angry that the d&c was done blindly (not with ultrasound, due to not being ""cost effective""), upset that i'll probably have to go in for surgery again. Frustrated with my body. I can't look at a baby, or be around one without getting upset. I don't want to go to family events, because people in the family are trying for babies. It's like a slap in the face, a reminder of what i lost.

Hello everyone. 
 First, i'm so sincerely sorry for the pain you feel/have felt/continue to feel at the loss of a loved one and the fallout (with family) that seems to follow. I've read a a few threads and for the first time in many weeks feel like I am amongst people to truly understand what its like.
 I lost my mom very suddenly on the 10th of April. My parents live overseas and I saw her in December - she seemed well at the time. When I rushed back home in April things were very different. She had an emergency surgery that hadnt gone well, she was on life support and heavily sedated for the pain. We lost her a week later without ever having had a chance to say goodbye. The guilt I feel for not being there for her in her last conscious moments is extreme. Having to leave my father all by himself was no less difficult. 
 My husband has been incredibly supportive, as have many close friends but no one has experienced grief or loss - most times I feel there is an expectation that I will ""shrug it off"" and feel better. I sometimes feel that I am failing to do what is expected of me. And, I'm having real trouble with my in-laws. My husband's mother and sister expect me to be normal - becuause I lived away from my mom and only saw her infrequently they think I couldnt possibly have cared for her very much and dont understand when I am sad to have lost her. When my husband has tried to explain my need to distance myself from them for a while (because who can take the feeling of being judged and found wanting when they are at their lowest point?) they have retaliated and said that I'm a bad influence on the family and that I am taking my husband away from them. 
 I'm floored by it all. Up until my mother's death I've had an amicable relationship with my in-laws; we've helped each other out often. So I dont understand why they seem to have turned on me. I dont know if I'm over-reacting or whether I've done something wrong by them. 
My mother was an incredibly strong woman - I miss her encouragement and support every day. I feel so let down by the people I thought would help me through her loss. 
 What can I do?

Dear Mum
¬†
You were always there for me.
¬†
Through thick and thin and wow we sure had some troubles.
¬†
When I was so young, the amount of times I cried for you when you had to leave the hospital that I was in;¬† you left and headed off in the dark, to catch a bus to where your parents lived.
¬†
So many trips to Sydney back and forth, for operations, for check-ups ‚Äì all to see how my lip was recovering and determining for when the next operation would be.¬† 10 operations in all ‚Äì can‚Äôt count the amount of trips to Sydney;¬† but you were there with me every step of the way.
¬†
You also had those two awful bouts of breast cancer, together with all the treatment.
¬†
Then Dad with his two heart operations ‚Äì for the 2nd one, I went to Sydney to be with you (and Dad) .
¬†
Every time Dad was admitted to hospital, you‚Äôd be there with him, by his bed-side.
¬†
In 1991, you had to bury your beloved son ‚Äì which I know you (we) never got over;¬† how could we?¬†¬† Something just impossible to do and from that tragedy, that killed off so much within all of us.¬† Your son, my brother ‚Äì there could have been 2 drownings that day, but oh no, I was able to save myself, but I couldn‚Äôt save my best mate, my bro;¬† drowned at the age of 29.¬† Yet you never blamed me, you always stood by me and tried your best to make sure I was ok.¬† I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äì but then, neither were you (or Dad).
¬†
Move to 2007 and we lost Dad to leukaemia ‚Äì and you were then without your life partner; your soul mate ‚Äì Dad.
¬†
You were a beautiful couple.¬† I cannot ever recall a fight between the two of you ‚Äì Dad the laid-back farmer, and you were his wonderful wife, our wonderful Mum, who had to struggle through farm hardships and never having much money, but as kids, we didn‚Äôt want for nothing.
¬†
Mum, it‚Äôs coming up to a year since you‚Äôve gone.¬† 365 days;¬† almost what they call a year in our human existence ‚Äì that you‚Äôve no longer been with us.¬† I cannot tell you the amount of times during this time that I have wanted to call you, to talk to you, to say ‚Äúhi‚Äù, to see ‚Äúhow you are‚Äù?
¬†
I write this now with tears streaming down my face. 
¬†
I miss you Mum.
¬†
I want to ring you ‚Äì I want to say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù and I want to tell you I love you.¬† But I can‚Äôt do that and I will never be able to do that again.
¬†
I just feel so sad and empty.
¬†
I love you Mum ‚Äì I will love you forever.
¬†
I miss you Mum and I will never ever stop missing you.

There is usually sympathy given when someone loses a loved one but in my case my husband is still alive but we have lost the way of life we previously had. I have had to stop work to care for him. He is blind so going to a movie, playing card or board games no longer work. We used to enjoy camping, exploring & hiking but now I do all the driving, navigating , packing, setting up camp, cooking cleaning etc so going away is no long the relaxing holiday it was. When walking I am on alert for obstacles such as over hanging branches etc that his cane won't pick up & the more adventurous walks are too difficult to manage. Planning holidays results in disappointments because every one planned over the last 18mths has been foiled by illness or injury. i also miss having his support to do daily tasks Have others dealt with this.

I received a call on the 9/2/16, from my dad saying mum was in hospital. Who would have known less than 24hrs later we would have to turn off life support. Mum went into complete kidney and liver failure over night and her organs just shut down on her, my Aunty and myself refused to leave her side, the Drs said there was nothing they could do for her so at 9.55am on the 10/2/16 my father, sisters, aunts and uncle and our children stood around her hospital bed as she passed away 5 mins later. Mum was only 61. We could not cremate her for 9 days due to a autopsy having to be performed. Coroner has been unable to find a cause of death, we have been told it could be a year before we know. Since she died I have had to organise a funeral, then pack up a house that has 20yrs of memories and help my dad move my two sisters are fighting so no help from them. Dad had to move as its to hard for him. When I was going through the house I came across hand written notes that give me the impression that mum knew she was sick and dying. It rips my heart out to think that she had to go through all of that on her own it must have been the most terrifying experience and It eats at me daily that she couldn't tell me, or felt she needed to keep it to herself. I feel like a failure of a daughter. Nothing anyone says makes a difference üòû

Hi, i recentley lost my friend Daniel to suicide. We used to date back when we were 16. We bonded over music and we always had a great laugh together, we got along easily. He returned to my life six months ago and we fell in love. He was recently out of a marriage and wanted to slow down. We ended up having a chaotic few months as i wanted to date and he didnt. Finally things came together and we began to make plans to start dating. He was having trouble with his ex wife and the parenting of his kids and committed suicide after leaving me an angry voicemail saying i had caused him nothing but pain. After that i lost contact with him and suffered a nervous breakdown/pshycotic episode and was hospitalized. When i was discharged i called him and his best mate to see what had happened and he said he had committed suicide. Im struggling with the loss as we would have such a great time together when we hung out and i saw him as my future. He was the closest id come to love and a relationship since the breakdown of my marriage and i feel alone and wonder how will i ever meet somebody else. I feel isolated and sad that i lost such a great person and old friend.

Hello, 
 I have a client whose dad passed away 5 months ago and he is struggling to emotionally regulate and vocalize his emotions. He tried to attend just a kids camp (nothing specializes) but got sent home due to his disengagement and non compliance to camp rules. Is there any kids/teen camps that might be more suitable for what his going through in Perth, WA?

Hi, 
I feel so ridiculous. A friend of mine, not that close.... but still. Took his own life yesterday. He was 28.
So talented, so good looking, such potential. I'm nearly twice as old as him and have done maybe half as much. It is so senseless. I don't know the details of how it happened. There is an enormous outpouring of emotion on Social Media. I am myself depressed about other issues in my life, I have two similarly aged young adult children.
My tears for this young man seem so disproportionate. There is nothing I could have done I think, I really don't know. I regret not appreciating the small interactions that I had with him. I wish that this were a joke or some fantasy story that is not the reality.
It's very sad. I don't know how to get past this. So much grief flows through my entire life. ( Sounds so pretentious)
I didn't want to put these thoughts on other online media, because of the disproportionality. It is a kind of letter to the young man and Cosmos of how I'm thinking.

I am a sufferer of depression and anxiety (GAD). I am very well now, after a long journey through many treatments and like to think I live a very fulfilling, happy life and keep my wellbeing in check. I absolutely credit my great place to my partner who has been nothing but amazing for the entire time, and been right there by my side where others have not throughout my mental health challenges.
 Recently, my partner lost his father suddenly to cancer. I have found myself in a position where I now need to be the absolute rock for my partner as he goes through this, whilst also dealing with the grief and processing the situation myself. I have found this especially hard on my mental health, where before I have felt like I can call out a bad day- considering everything he is going through I don't want to pile anything else on him. 
 I wanted to see if anyone else who has mental health challenges has been in a similar situation and has any advice on how best to manage not only the wellbeing of my best friend and partner, but myself?

Yesterday was a horrible day... went to work , turned on the radio and the DJ was talking about someone receiving an email from his father after his father had passed.. as he read the email it sounded word for word what dad would say to me... they cut to a song and it was one of dads that we played at his funeral.. this got me going to the bathroom for a cry (thank god I work alone some days)..busy day seeing clients and helping them.. the only quite moment during the day I have another song came on the radio that was a song that ment a lot to the family that he sung a lot...spent all that night having dreams about him.. today I am seeing a new client with her parents only to find out that the clients mum is a nurse and helped dad whilst he was in hospital.. she couldn't stop crying telling me how sorry she was.. 
I normally walk each morning to help reduce my stress. I stopped when dad passed unable to find the energy and started again over the weekend...But over the last two days these seems to be making it harder as I think its bring back the grief.. its been two months since his passing and I have been ok and at peace with his passing normally walking helps me for my mental state and listing to music help me remember him in a good way and not pulling at the heart strings.. but not this week.. do I walk through it or find a new exercise to be my stress relief

My siblings haven't been in contact with me since they each married 30-40 years ago. I'm now middle aged, both my parents have died, and my fianc√© after which I felt like I went through a nervous breakdown, the new career I'd spent 3 years studying for collapsed into a heap before I could finish. While my fianc√© died 9 years ago and was really the catalyst, the grief of losing my mum returned and has remained raw. It's contributed to my social phobia coming back. I find other people talking about their family too painful to bear and keeping me isolated. No one understands the pain of having no family, or none that want to know you.  I wish I could hit a delete button on some of my emotions! and develop a thick skin. I've wondered about rewriting my 'story' for the purpose of answering all the polite 'get to know you questions'. Only people with similar lived experiences get it, I really need to know how other people cope.

On this day 36 years ago my life changed irrevocably. I became alone in the world. Without warning my mother had a
severe stroke and a few hours later the machine that was keeping her body alive was turned off. Meanwhile at home, my terminally ill father 
who‚Äôs mind had long ago left his body had no idea that his wife and carer for so many hard years had left this mortal coil. Later in the 
afternoon he was taken to hospital and after pulling many strings I had him admitted into a fine nursing home to live out his last few years 
oblivious of this harsh new reality. Call me cruel for those actions but first think hard about it. 
¬†
I have now been alone for so long. No brothers, sisters, cousins, no one at all and a failed marriage but fortunately no children.For those of you that have ‚Äúfamily‚Äù cherish every moment. If you don‚Äôt speak or even acknowledge a relation for whatever reason, they are still there. They are still on this planet and deep down in your subconscious th0e link is not broken. Take a moment to reflect on the Christmases, 
birthdays and those many events that give the word ‚Äúfamily‚Äù real meaning. Whether it‚Äôs good or bad  believe me, the alternative is an 
emptiness that in time makes you sour to so many things, believe me, I know.
I didn‚Äôt write this for sympathy. I didn‚Äôt write this to cry ‚Äúwhy me?‚Äù I wrote this to remind you to take a moment to think about your respective
families, of who you have in your life and how they may have helped to shape you into the wonderful people you are.

In 2011 my mum was killed in a hit and run whilst on holidays in Qld. She lived in the same town as me in Vic. My dad was up there too but wasn't riding with her that day. The shock was massive and my life just plummeted into a dark hole. I was basically crippled socially. I didn't want to see anyone for a very long time. I thought everyone was going to die so what was the point in having friends? Every time I drove my car, every vehicle I passed I would think ""Is this the one that will veer into my lane and kill me?"" I was always waiting to be hit and killed. I cried all the time and panicked if I was in any social situation. I had no social life for years because of it. It will be 5 years this Sept and I am only just starting to enjoy going to dinner with my friends instead of avoiding it. I was and am a single mother and my daughter pretty much had to fend for herself for much of the first year. There is nothing I can do about it now, but for my own knowledge, I am wondering if it is possible that the shock led to PTSD? I have never considered it until I heard someone speaking about it and thought, that sounds like I was until very recently...

I'm new to this forum and I don't even know what I want from this, but I'm just lost.
October last year I lost my mum, very suddenly. A healthy woman who has never had more than a cold, contracted bacterial meningitis and in a matter of days, she could not fight it anymore and it took her. She was 61, and loving life.
I guess there are a few factors that make this harder for me, she lived in the UK, along with all my family, as that's where I am originally from. I didn't get there in time to see her. I had to wait for my then 4 month old baby's passport. I landed in the UK and went straight into organizing her funeral. She never met my son, it was her first grandchild. We had flights booked to go to the UK that January as we wanted to wait until he was 6 months. She missed my entire journey from being pregnant, labour and meeting him and seeing me as a Mother.¬†
On the outside I seem like I am dealing with it, I have a son that needs taking care of. But I'm broken inside and don't know what to do. I am normally a strong independent person and I've become this fragile nervous mess. This is not how I want to be.¬†
I organised to see a counselor, but I've been once and then they didn't have availability for another month so I'm still waiting to go again which I feel like it's had a really negative effect. I'm not religious, and have no beliefs as to what happens when you die so I'm really struggling to find peace anywhere.¬†

Soon to be one year ago I lost my ex-boyfriend/boyfriend to suicide, I have a lot of pain and guilt that is ruining me. There's also a story behind the reason I feel guilty. As many of his family, friends, specialists tell me it's not my fault I just can't seem to think otherwise. He had alot of mental health problems also, which is why we bonded as much as we did. I just feel empty, like there's a part of me missing, I don't feel as if I am ever going to find someone that i connect with or is as similar as me, and I don't want too. I miss him so much, I'm physically and mentally in pain every day, I even googled 'How to bring someone back to life' with the knowledge it's not possible, I check my messages everyday hoping I get a message from him saying it was all a joke (which I know it's not). I would never put my family through the pain I've been constantly feeling for the past year but I am in so such pain that I think about suicide constantly. I have PTSD plus many more diagnoses from this accident. The flashbacks, the nightmares every night, the deep depression, the memories are crippling me, every second of each day.¬†

Hello,
Now both ¬†my parents are gone I feel so lonely, ¬†lost and struggling to cope.
My Dad passed away in 2010, he was in high care nursing home with ¬†Mum (Mum had been in care since 2007) . It wasn't unexpected but still so hard. Dad was scared to leave Mum, he had cared for her for so many years (Mum also suffered with mental illness from her mid 40's). He asked me, the youngest of us 4 kids and the only girl, to look after Mum. This seemed to make it more peaceful for him. He was 76 when he passed away.
Through looking after Mum for 5 years we had alot of ups and downs. In 2007 she had renal failure, had her last rites read to her, we were told it was her time. She was such a strong willed woman she recovered. At this time she also had suffered 8 strokes which we only found out through a cat scan. She was unable to walk from here on in, although mentally she was wonderful.
We had some extremely funny times as Mum would just say what was on her mind not caring too much for other people's feeling, also very sad times. But I guess this was Mums way of coping.
She passed away 7th November last year. She deteriorated over a few months, she was worn out.
It was so hard to see, I was the only one with her when she passed, daunting but grateful. She also was 76.
I like to think I did exactly what Dad had asked of me right to the end, he would not have wanted her to be alone.
This is my first post, hope it's ok. My name is lee and I'm 41yo.
Thanks for your patience.

Less than 12 months ago I lost my Lab, Buddy. Woke up one morning and he was paralysed from the waist down and the vets couldn't figure out why. Shortly after, my partner and I got a puppy, a beautiful Staffy x Corgi. We named her Sierra. She was our baby, and as any animal-lover knows, fur babies mean just as much as a human baby could. Yesterday, at the young age of 10 months, my partner came outside to find our little Sierra not moving, and unresponsive. He rushed her to the emergency vet only to confirm what we already feared: she had died. They suspected a snake, which was confirmed when my brother raced home to bring our other dog inside and found the dead snake in our backyard. Sierra had managed to kill it, but at the cost of her own life. She was my little baby. After losing Buddy, I thought I would never be the same, but Sierra brought a light into our lives when we needed it most, and now she's gone. I'm so angry. At myself, at the universe, at everything. And so, so, so wrecked. I miss my baby girl so much. Between losing Buddy and now her, I don't know what to do. I can't breathe. I can't stop crying. I feel like I'm dying. I also have an older Lab, Bella, who probably does not have much time left with us. When she passes..... I don't even know. I'm so lost. So confused. Why? Why did this have to happen? If I had just been home earlier, I could have brought them back inside like I always do and she would still be with us. I would have woken up this morning to a hyperactive puppy jumping on my head, instead of hyperventilating and wiping the tears from my eyes. I wouldn't have ended the day at the vet, saying goodbye to my baby girl, instead I would've stayed up way too late binge-watching on Netflix. There are so many ""what if""s. So many ""should have""s. So many regrets. I don't know how to get through this. I don't know if I can.

Well this is tough, last month i lost my companion of 4yrs ¬†Parrot, who got me through so many dark times. I've never fallen to bits so much, i thought i was going to die from distress. I'm still not right, its a tiny bit better, but now it's turned into who's next?, what other bad things will happen?, i feel so down daily, some nights i cry myself to sleep. I was with him in the end, watched his poor little body give up, i think he had a lung infection, noticed his voice was a bit funny night before. ¬†I woke up to him sitting down panting, the trauma i somehow relive it daily, mentally i see it all the time his last breath?, how do i get that out of my head?. It's unfair the bond i had with him was so strong, like he knew me, I knew him. The positive thing that came from all this, his companion had babies and now i 3 nice baby parrots that look like him, but they are not him!!!, I'm trying to bond but it's difficult.. I have the fear of things being taken away from me in life, and this kind of re-affirms it, the pain is so unbearable emotionally. Anyhow perhaps time is the healer idk, i just know it's flung me into this awful depression of sorts..I'm prob rambling on thanks...TC :D.

Recently I met someone its not the best relationship but I have noticed I have become a cold person I don't allow intimacy to occur as i have now locked my feeling away and find it hard to express my love for my partner. We have recently moved in together. I feel that i'm at breaking point i have organized everything from the bond to the lease, utilities, purchasing the white goods. I have episodes of anxiety and feel so overwhelmed and don't enjoy these happy moments in life i feel as though i'm headed for a nervous breakdown my partner knows nothing of how i feel i should add i am also gay cheers¬†beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to¬†suicide or self-harm.

My parents are both gone. I'm an adult with my own family but having lost both my parents while almost all my friends and cousins still have both parents and even Grandparents. I'm really struggling to get over the feeling of being completely and utterly left on my own. I do have a brother but we've never got along and I am finding it's one sided communication as I don't want to lose touch with him but it's as if I no longer exist at all. I feel as if I have no family and am trying to turn my attention to my husband and babies but it's unbelievably difficult to deal with all of this.
¬†
The other thing is I feel so guilty as I'm in Australia and my Dad passed away back home in the UK. I didn't make it back in time and he passed away before I'd even got on the flight home. When we moved to Australia a year ago I promised we'd be back to visit him hopefully in 2 years for a holiday. Of course, I can't believe this has happened and I never did get to see him again.¬†
¬†
Also, my Father's passing has opened up the old feelings of when Mum died suddenly. Now I miss her more than ever and it feels unbearable that they're both gone. My Mum was my best friend before she died and we'd only really bonded like friends over the few years before she died as I'd only just moved out of their house into my own place.
¬†
Sorry, I'm rambling a lot. It just all came out when I started typing.
¬†
I hope you understand as I've literally no one to talk to about this now. Everyone thinks I should be trying to move on and concentrate on my own little family. My husband is a bit fed up of me to be honest. I feel like a dark cloud in their lives just now.
¬†
Thanks for reading. I hope someone understands.

I recently lost my Dad on New Years day after a 10 year illness. Each day it seems to get harder not easier. I feel like I have lost a piece of myself and I have no idea how to deal with his loss.
I'm not used to feeling such overwhelming intense sadness. I don't sleep, I can't concentrate on anything and I physically feel unwell. ¬†
He was such an amazing man, an amazing Dad and Pop to my 2 young boys.
I don't know how to process what I'm feeling.

hi everyone I am new here .three and a half years ago I lost my husband and cant seem to move on. I have tried and even at times seemed to be on the right track. Then a problem would come up ,the house or extra bills and I panic and miss him so much. He was my rock for thirty years and looked after me when my epilepsy turned me into a vegetable. Bought me back to life again. made the decisions and sheltered me from all the worries. now I am alone and lonely and feel I have nowhere to turn. my local GP is run off his feet and doesn't even look at you ,let alone invite confidences. the nearest other clinic is 50kms. I cant make friends and my family are all living away. some days when I have no reason to leave the house I just stay in bed and read. I even joined the local mental health group ,we don't even talk.so that was a waste of time. Ended up at the pokies just to get out of the house and they became a big problem.so it was a call to lifeline and self barring .only way to stop that. Trouble is I am even more isolated now. am I just feeling selfpity? or am I heading for something much worse?

Hello,¬†
first off I hope everyone is doing as best as they can as I'm sure we are all here searching for ways to cope and to even understand other people's thoughts and processes. I have recently lost my older brother, he tragically took his own life without much explanation or warning. I do not know how or where to begin but would love to know if there is support groups or places in Adelaide where people who have been through traumatic events can come together as I struggle to relate to my friends as they don't quite get how I feel. As I don't truly understand how I feel... There is numbness, anger, sadness, love, all in one.¬†

When I was 10 I lost my father to Aids. I didn't understand the reasons or the permanency of death. Now as a 30 year old I constantly ask myself how can I not exist? Why am I here? Why did my dad die? How can I not be me? It makes no sense and it scares me to the point of tears. I have a 6 and 5 year old and I know that not only will I die but they will to. Does anyone else ever have these thoughts? Or is there something wrong with me?

Hi,
I lost my dad this August he was 54yrs old & his death was unexpected. He had been sick for about 2 years but his disease was always making him sick & then he would get better again. My sister & I left in May this year to travel Europe for 4 months & then live in London we both quit our jobs & where just wanting to find ourselves. 
Dad seemed like he was doing better so off we went & 3 months in we had to urgently return home, we got 5 days with him although he was never conscious we got to be by his side when he passed.
There is just so much regret & guilt now. I'm just lost I have to find a new job & be in a home without him. At the moment me, my sister & mum don't really talk about what we are feeling, it scares me to know how bad they hurt I hate it.¬†
I feel like I have no direction anymore our whole world is different & I just feel anxious. I have an interview tomorrow & im so stressed about it, it feels like once I have job reality is going to hit. My sister & I couldn't wait to get out of our sydney. Now we are back here & trying to face life without my dad. He was an amazing man & he held our family together. He didn't deserve to be taken away so early.¬†
I just don't know how to go about everyday life & be happy.¬†
Any advice would be great.

I think I might be grieving for my mum, problem is she hasn't passed away.
she has cancer and so its inevitable that I will have to say goodbye, but I think part of my anxiety and depression is that I'm already grieving for her?
I don't want to be like this, I want to go and see her ( she is in the uk) and I want to make the most of the time I have, but I feel almost crippled with these feelings. I want to be strong but I can't find a way to do it.
i skyped with her yesterday and I was looking at her realising how I'll she was and how much she has changed and I cried and she cried.¬†
I miss her so much already I feel like I'm going to completely lose myself.
i don't know if anyone will have any insights or helpful words, but I just wanted to get this out of my head and I will talk to my psychologist about it when I see him next.

Five years ago my dad died and it took me a long time to come to terms with it. We had a sometimes turbulent relationship during my childhood but we had finally gotten to best place we'd ever been and I was considering moving interstate to care for him but unfortunately that of course never happened. I cried so hard every day for a month that I gave myself intense headaches and even threw up sometimes. Normal? I thought so at the time as did my then-counsellor. After all, death is traumatic. After a couple of months I was able to live day to day without breaking down, though he still has crossed my mind literally every day since, mostly happy memories. So after getting a grip of my feelings of guilt and regret, this past month everything has come undone. I am suddenly having dreams about him every week which I haven't experienced since the year he passed. The other morning I was dreaming of him and as I woke, before I even opened my eyes, I began to cry. I lay in bed bawling and howling for what felt like an hour. I have dreams of him expressing disappointment in me or I'll dream that I see him in public but he ignores me. I wasn't always the best daughter and I am now having reoccurring feelings of intense guilt and self loathing. How can I go from being at peace with it to suddenly dreaming of him constantly and hating myself all over again? I don't know why I'm writing this here but I'm hoping somebody else who has experienced the loss of a parent might have some insight. Waking up and feeling like he died just yesterday isn't great considering I have finally been getting a handle on my depression and anxiety. This has all come out of the blue and it's overwhelming me to the point where all my old thoughts of self harm have resurfaced. Am I being dramatic? I opened up to a friend about it last week and told her about the past month and was met with ""you should be over it by now"" which I understand but suddenly I'm not over it anymore. How is that even possible? When I was on the bus yesterday I was just looking out the window and thought I saw him. For a split second I was 100% convinced it was him but then reality hit me and I felt like an idiot. Five years and that happened....it that abnormal? I don't even want to sleep tonight in case I dream of him again.

Hi there, I'm not sure if this is where I should start but Grief and Loss has led me to the position I'm in now.
I have recently lost the person I thought was my soul mate and life love, not only that but because they know they are in the wrong they have become somewhat psychotic. I'm dealing with a myriad of lies and harassment being thrown at me and I'm on such an emotional rollercoaster I don't know what to do with myself.
I guess my main questions at the moment are, Is it possible to *develop* split/multiple personalities, Is it possible to develop them by choice, and what are the psychological effects?
Sometimes I want to shut everything out so much, feel I'm under so much stress, pressure and pain, that I am able to shut everything off and become someone else for short periods of time, its basically still me but minus any background or history, if that makes sense...? I'm just existing.
I have created an alias for myself, well 2, but they are online presences only and don't have any 'life' so to say. But there are times when I feel like I want to switch to BEING that person for periods of time.
I have a very broad personality, like I'm not the same around everyone (I know that's pretty normal for most), but there are parts of me I feel like I would like to section out, like becoming 2 or 3 different people dependant on situation. For example when I'm around others I want to be the happy laughing fun me, when I'm alone I want to become the serious devoted author, and at work I want to be the standard unfeeling corporate drone to get through each day.
¬†So...
Is it possible, and really is it healthy...?

Hi anyone in new here so please bare with me.
in April this year I lost my only child at 24 weeks gestation due to a rare condition.¬†
Im really struggling I've gone through good and bad moments but by far this is the worst.¬†
from the moment I the dr told me my son would not make it I have felt empty and cold. I have no affection or love for anyone anymore.and I dream about my son constantly.
i dnt understand how my life went from so perfect to so bad in a matter of a few hours, my life really took a bad turn the day I walked out of the hospital with empty arms and know I was walking away from my son and my heart, leaving him at the hospital and there was nothing I could do. I will never forget driving out of the city heading home that night I was discharge driving away from the city lights into the country darkness saying goodbye to my lil boy.¬†
I have no purpose in life anymore I failed my son and I knew that the moment I delivered him and held him he was so perfect and looked so pieceful as though he knew I was his mummy.¬†
But really rips my guts of is that he passed away while I was actually delivering him.¬†
I felt him moving just before the dr told me it was time to push.
¬†im really in a bad place and have a lot of pressure.¬†
My husband has 2 children to his ex who he doesn't see because of me and our late son. (His ex hates me and the fact that we had a child) so he doesn't see them.

thanks for listening¬†
feel free to share your story's or nice comments keep the bad comments quiet plz

In June of 2014 I moved to Australia to be with my fiance--leaving my family and friends in east coast of the states. I left knowing that my mother's ongoing battle with addiction wasn't improving. My biggest fear when leaving was that something would happen to my mom while I was away. That fear came true on Easter morning when I woke up to a phone call from my father and brothers telling me that my mother had passed away. Since that day my heart has been broken and is nowhere near healed.
I went back to the states with my partner for the services and came back 3 weeks later to continue my life in Australia. A month and a half later my partner and I had split and I decided to stay in Australia on my own. The past 5 months have been a constant struggle. Feeling every emotion possible--all at a heightened level. Whenever I feel like I've taken 2 steps forward I find myself going backwards again.¬†
¬†I realised in this time period that grief isn't just about death--it's about loss. I lost two things, my mom and my relationship. I lost the two most important people in my life and I feel that no one around me gets it at all.
On the surface I seem OK for the most part, people can't see the pain that I'm going through but the pain is so significant and it's not getting easier. I find that I can't talk to anyone to TRULY tell them about my pain. It's not that I don't want to, it's that I can't find the words. I can't even figure it out myself.

I lost my husband 7 weeks ago, although he was ill his death was very sudden, we had been together for 32 years. ¬†My hubby was 52 when he passed away. ¬†He was my best friend and the love of my life, I am feeling very lost without him. ¬†I know people say give it time but for me the pain is more now than when he first passed. ¬†The hardest things I have found are not having someone to share your life with, ¬†to hold hands and cuddle. ¬†The little things that I guess we all take for granted, going out instead of two their is now only one. ¬†How do people get over their grief? ¬† We have two beautiful children who are older and who have also been traumatised by the passing of my hubby so I try to be strong in front of them but I am finding this harder and harder to do. ¬† Does anyone have any advice, I guess I am hoping that others will be able to share their stories and that maybe this will help ¬†me to understand grief.

My partner and I got engaged last year and in that moment life felt perfect. After a terrible argument early this year , we split up. I was very angry and though my heart craved for him, I refused to speak to him. He tried really hard - emailing regularly to me - to win me back. Then one fine day cops came around to tell me that he was found dead at his home. We don't know if it was drugs or a heart attack. He was found after 12 days
¬†Its been six months and I am still grappling with it. Breaks my heart every time I think my babe was dead for 12 days.¬†
¬†the year held so much promise for us and the last 7 months have been in a nightmare.
I miss him so much that it overwhelms me.¬†

At the start of October I lost my uncle. He and I were very close until this year and while I mourned his death I think I was coping ok. I know this was partly because I had so much to do following his death but also because my best friend was there to support me even though he was on the other side of the world.¬†
2 days after I buried my uncle, my best friend disappeared. This was someone I spoke to online or via phone calls multiple times a day, after a week of worry his son called me to let me know he had passed away from a heart attack (just 48) the day he disappeared from my life.
with the news of his death I have literally fallen apart and hiss loss hurts so much more then that of my uncles. I feel guilty that this has hurt me more and I find myself even after 3 weeks not being able to cope.¬†
I loved my friend and now find that without ever realising it he infiltrated a lot of my life. Certain times of the day are hard now, for example- we always talked at 8:30pm every night before he went to work. And I find myself reaching for my phone at these times without thinking or expecting the phone to ring. I get angry at myself doing this and often just curl up and cry.
im trying so hard to distract myself during these times and I am failing miserably
my partner is worried, he thinks I was unable to get closure by not going to the funeral and worried that since my bestfriend was my go to person for most things that I don't have the support I need to get through this. (He feels he isn't enough).
I know eventually I'm going to be ok. But now im not only trying to remind myself not to expect the phone to ring etc and break the habits I've spent 15 years doing with my bestfriend but I'm trying to force myself back together to ease the burden this is placing on my partner.¬†
I suppose I'm looking for advice not just with coping mechanisms but of ways I can better deal (work through?) this loss without my usual support, instead of burdening just 1 person with everything

My husband passed away on 16th September, I found him, in our lounge room, collapsed on the floor. I thought that he had fallen and hit his head, but when I moved his arm there was no response, I think I knew he was dead, but called 000 and did cpr and mouth-to-mouth until help arrived. It was awful. Probably the worst thing I have ever experienced. I thank God for my kids (all adults) who were with me as soon as they could. I am grateful for the friends who have rallied around me. It hasnt been long, I realise that, but I am so lonely. I cry so much and when I think I can't cry any more the tears come again. I wander around the house lost. I don't know where to turn. I am seeing my psych more at the moment that ever before. I take my meds, more aware of how much I need them now. But I find coping on a day to day basis so hard. And the anger, it is so intense. I let people see only a part of me, they dont see the loneliness, the hurt and pain, the depression that is worse than ever. I try not to let people in to my empty world, I pretend all is ok and I am getting on with life, when in reality I am not. My step daughters (both adults) want to come and go through their fathers stuff, I have said no, they dont understand that I need to do it in my own time, when I am ready. They tell me I am selfish, but I need time with what I have left of him, and that is just his material possessions. I dont know what is right or wrong with regards his things. We had been together 15 years. It wasnt a lifetime in some peoples lives, but it was our life time. I am scared of being alone and I am scared of how this is affecting my depression and bi=polar. Its funny people always tell me I am a strong person, but I am not. I am not coping and don't know where to turn. The loss is so immense, part of me wishes I was with with him, not that I am suicidal, just lonely and lost. My children tell me to call anytime, but I don't want to burden them. I wonder where I am heading now, what do I do with my days, how do I continue on. He was my world, we did everything together and I am just broken. Have you experienced what I am going through? How did you cope? How did you get through? Life seems so unfair, we had just moved to a new house, we had made plans. So lost, so lonely, so angry, so heart broken, so depressed, so very very sad

Between june and august i went to 5 funerals. My uncle (very sick) and one of my friends fathers whilst i was growing up. Then my partners grandfather died. Two weeks after that my best friend called me at work and said he and his father had found his mother (suicide). Her funeral was on a friday. Then the Sunday of that weekend my Nan passed away. I was at her bedside and it was peaceful. But when it was all happening i sort of felt like i was making a recovery from one death and boom. Another would come along. So i just got on with it and tried to cope the best i could and supporting my mum. Im also building a house which is stressful in itself. My partner is a police officer and whilst trying to be helpful its been a bit rough. Now im finding that everything has calmed down and is back on track, all the deaths are catching up to me at once. And i find it really hard to get up. Im crying and lashing out at my partner but he doesnt understand. Work (law firm) is also stressful and everything is just piling up and i feel like i cant breathe.¬†

Two weeks ago, my uncle died.
Growing up, I had very little family outside my immediate one. I had my parents, my brother and sister, my grandmother and her husband and my uncle. That was it.
I would like to recognise that I know I am incredibly fortunate just to have had that much. I know many don't.¬†
I have not known grief or loss. Growing up on a farm, losing pets was never that much of a sad occasion. You were grateful for the memory but the loss wasn't usually unexpected. The only other two people I know who have died were great-grandmothers - and their deaths were not unexpected. We celebrated their long lives and all they had accomplished. There was some mourning, but I never knew them well enough to feel that great loss.¬†
My uncle was 48. He was my dad's best friend for almost four decades. He was diagnosed with brain tumours two years ago. He leaves behind two tween children.¬†
Even writing this, I tear up. This was the only person who I have in my memories outside of my immediate family who has been there. He let me live with him for a few months when I moved to the city for work before I found a place to live. When I did move out he was the person I knew I could call at any time if I was in trouble and he'd be there. He is in many of my memories as a child and teenager.¬†
I don't even know how to handle such a loss. The family didn't have a funeral, and while I went home to be with my mum and spend time being supported by my boyfriend (long distance), coming back to my regular life has been incredibly difficult. I live across the other side of the country to all I know and love. I find myself mindlessly watching TV or sleeping or pacing. If I'm not forgetting to eat, I'm eating a lot. I'm recognising signs of when I suffered depression almost two years ago.¬†
Does it get easier? Do you feel normal again? Even those I know who have lived through loss haven't been able to help me - no one I know has any kind of similar story.
I'm at a bit of a loss.

It's been 8 months since my wife has left me and took the kids and moved away.
It still doesnt make sense that she has done this as I treated her really well. Yes we had our ups and downs like every marraige, but to say I ruined her and then proceed to have an affair was horrible.
The problem is I would forgive her and take her back to right the wrongs.
Ive being doing OK and starting to see other people. I just cant proceed any further than friends with these women as when I compare them to my wife, I find I still love her.
Ive been freaking out lately knowing Ive probably lost her for good and wont see my children day to day.

Hello, I'm not used to doing this whole thread thing but I need advice. I lost my best friend (18) to suicide in mid August this year. In the following 24 hours, I lost my brother (15) to respiratory failure. It happened two months ago and I'm still waking up to forgetting they're gone. Every time I remember it tears me apart like it did initially. My heart aches and I can't stop crying. This happens on a daily basis. My brother was like my secons best friend. I can't even begin to think how I'm going to remember that the two of them are no longer here... I never thought I'd ever had to think about it before.¬†
‚ÄãI see my psychologist once a month and I'm no longer in school so I can't see the counsellor. I try to drown myself in work and music and cleaning but whenever I stop something, I just breakdown. I don't enjoy the things I once loved. I bought myself a baby rabbit and he's helping me by keeping me company and keeping me busy. But I have exams coming up and I just can't push myself into studying like I need to.
¬†Part of me feels selfish whenever I smile or laugh. I feel like I shouldn't be happy. I'm just really lost. ¬†But yeah, any suggestions?

I lost my sister - my best friend - about 2 and a half years ago. About three months ago my boyfriend left me, in many ways related to my inability to move past my grief but for other reasons as well. ¬†I have been prone to depression on and off throughout my life, but when I have been at my lowest over the past few years, he was my rock, my saviour, the one who understood and knew what to say and do.
I am trying to get on with things, I am trying to focus on myself and the things that bring me joy but I find that there are so few of these things these days.
The worst for me right now is the loneliness. Without my sister and through my grief, my relationships have all changed, with my friends, with her friends. Some of them can't handle who I am now, the new less fun, more sad version of me. Some of them have moved on and made families in the period that I was focused on my sister's health, then my relationship and now my own wellbeing. Some are just harder to be around; our values and views are different. ¬†The things that I used to enjoy doing are more difficult to do now and I have less people to do them with.
I feel like what I need is to find people who can relate to me, where I don't feel pressure to be happy and fun all the time. People who understand what it's like and accept me for who I am now. Are there groups like this? Two years ago I didn't think I would benefit from this kind of support, but now I think I would. ¬†I just need more supportive friends around me and I don't know where to look. I don't know how it got to this point for me, how I have gone from having so many friends to being so alone. ¬†I guess what I need from my friends has changed and what I am able to offer seems less than it was. ¬†Does anyone else know where to look?

Hey guys, straight to the point, I've never really been in touch with my emotions and have recently been told that my God mother passed away a few months ago (been fighting cancer a few years) and my grandmother may have bowel cancer (which her father passed away from). Any tips are appreciated.

Hi everyone,
I am new to this but here goes. I have just lost my darling husband after 46 years and sometimes my grief just overwhelms me and I don't know what to do. I find I am getting jealous of my married friends and I am worried I will alienate people. I feel just completely overwhelmed by my feelings. Is this normal --it seems to be getting worse not better. He died after a long illness two months ago.

Hi,¬†
Myself and my best friend have lost a friend to suicide almost two months ago. She was very close to him and is not coping well. I am trying to be supportive, let her know I loved her and I would always be there for her etc. I tried organising a catch up even if just for a quick hello/coffee but she can't seem to lock anything in with me or not making time for me (even though she has caught up with a few other friends). I keep trying to tell myself its normal to go through these emotions and you can push people away in these times of grief. But we were super close and now I can't understand why my best friend has pushed me away so much but seems to be reaching out to other friends and her new relationship. She says she isn't happy and nothing is making her happy yet she seems to be very happy with her new partner and is talking to her other friends and not a single interaction with me.
I am very hurt and we have talked a bit about it and I have expressed very honestly but kindly how I feel (mainly that I am hurting to and I just want us to be there for each other, I miss her a lot), but she seems to avoid the issue of how I am feeling very hurt when I just want to be there for her, but also I need her to be there for me as I am grieving too. She has lashed out at me as well, but also says she is the closest to me and she loves me, but her actions tell me otherwise and I really felt like our friendship is broken. It is giving me anxiety and because we were so close, now I feel alone and like I cant talk to anyone. It seems everything she says is the opposite of how she is reacting and that makes me upset because I feel like she actually doesn't care anymore about what we have lost in our friendship too.¬†
I need some insight as to why she keeps saying I miss you and need you, but she won't make the time to catch up, we aren't talking but she has been interacting a lot more with other friends.¬†
I don't know what to do. I have tried everything and I can't handle just being a sideline friend when I feel like I've lost my best friend :( Advice from anyone going through the same?
Thanks.¬†

Hi my name is Ingrid I lost my daughter to suicide 3 years ago and it is not getting easier, I have grief attacks fairly frequently which throws me into a mix of emotions and depression. I also have very little support and as for friends who I can talk to a few and far between which I think makes it harder. Iam no longer the same person and wonder will this ever get any easier, because I don't think I can live my life like this much longer. Thanks for listening..

My son lost the will to live almost 3 months ago.He had suffered with mental illness since about the age of 16 years .He was diagnosed with multipal conditions on numerous different medications .Bipolar,scitzaphrinia,DID,mania,ocd just to name a few.i think this last year of his life was the hardest by far.i saw him at least every second day assisted him with daily activities,doctors appts. Just being there for him.He used to talk about suicide and how he wanted his mental pain to stop and this was the only way out .I tried so hard to get help for him .He even admitted himself to 2 private hospitals for 3months.2 days before he was discharged he tried to end his life in hospital.I pleaded with doctors and psycitrist not to that I was concerned .they told me they couldn't help him anymore.He health went down hill after that.i feel the mental health system failed him and feel I have failed my son.my pain is enormous and I miss him soo much.We need more education on mental health .I think it should be introduced in high school.There needs to be more awareness and more help emotionally physical they need empathy ,love,respect and understanding.I keep asking myself where did I go wrong what should've I done differently.I thought even he said he wants out of this mental torture I didn't think he'd go through with it.What can we do as a community to stop all this wasted lives.I thought my son will see me get old .Thanks in advance¬†¬†beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hello
I am new to this board.
I suffered a terrible loss 2 years ago.
My partner of 17 years died.
It would seem I have not been able to cope with the loss and accompanying other losses associated with her death.
There is so much to our story it would seem at time impossible and even like a betrayal to even talk about it all.
However i seem to have become chronically depressed over it all.
The depression started some 5 months after her death.
I did not understand how serious the depression was until I look back at what happened to me.
When she died I lost my best friend and partner.
As a result of bad decisions ,seemingly motivated by grief on my part I also lost my business ,my friends ,all my associates ,my community ,allot of money ,my country of residence for 13 years .
I am an Australian national however we lived in North America .
I came back to Australia for business and maybe relocation but accidentally let my visa expire.
I thought it would be easy to get it back ,however it has proved an impossible task.
I became stranded in a rural town in Australia.
I was semi Ok for round 5 months after her passing.
I would guess it was because I had my friends and business as a distraction and support.
When I lost everything ,including my partner I sunk into a profound depression.
These days I seem to wake up and wish I did not.
I have lost my social confidence also.
I have no thoughts of suicide just a sinking feeling in my tummy.
I cry allot over it all and have lost interest in most things I use to enjoy.
I have had grief counseling.
It was good but still at the end of the day I lost her and everything else.
It is very sad and nothing can change that.
On top of this I am being screened for cancer but have to wait as i have noprivate health insurance.
It all has become too much.
I think it would be for anyone.
The losses where tremendous.
Apologies regarding the length of this post.

My beautiful mum passed away 5 months ago and every day is getting harder. My mum was sick with Cancer but a horrible stroke came out of no where and took her from us leaving us all in shock. In my mind I mentally prepared myself for my mum passing away gradually from Cancer and I thought we still had plenty of time left. The stroke left her on life support and she passed away within 24 hours. I held her hand as she drifted away.
I am generally a strong person but this has knocked me for six. I am pining for her - I miss her terribly. My chest feels tight whenever I think about not been ever able to see her again. I keep thinking she is going to walk through the door at any minute. 
My mum was a huge part of my life and my families life - she was my best friend and I just cant comprehend all of this. She was beautiful, always well dressed and I just thought she would beat cancer and be with us for years to come.
I feel shocked and I feel such a huge loss - its quite overwhelming.......

I find myself on here after all this time because, if there is something that the social media ought to be able to do, it ought to be able to connect people who otherwise would be isolated from each other. And I have been isolated from anyone by a big and horrible word - suicide. More than fifty years ago my father committed suicide and I have never spoken about it with anyone even though I have come to the conclusion that I have to share this experience in order to deal with my feelings properly. Sound crazy? After 50 years! The problem has for me been the big wall of shame and secrecy behind which I have cowered all my life and I think now it has to stop - even if it is only in the ""virtual"" world that I am coming clean. I have had to speak about this stuff with my wife and three kids of course. And once I admitted to a colleague who was depressed, and whose own brother had committed suicide, that this is what my father had done. But that is it. In fifty years, that is it. For the rest of the time I have felt cripplingly and secretly ashamed of father while loving him at the same ¬†time. What happened caused a fair bit of damage as I am sure you can appreciate but, because of the nature of the trauma, I feel like I have not been entitled to deal with it openly ¬†/ socially. It is like my relative died and was buried in unsanctified ground outside the churchyard. If anyone ever caught me standing with flowers in my hand at his graveside I would be giving the game away. Everyone would know my shame. I got the loss but It feels like I also lost the right to grieve. I wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience?

I was 9 years old when I and my 7 year old brother were alone in the house when we found my father had died in his sleep. In a cruel twist of faith almost 39 years to the day we found our 13 year old boy had also left us while gently sleeping. In my mid 20's my brother and his friend were walking along a sea promenade in the middle of the afternoon and were both taken by a freak wave. They were never found.
I guess that sort of qualifies me to speak about coping with grief. As a little boy I became aware early that I needed to make a decision. I could get all the sympathy and support I needed, but I never liked it. For some reason playing that card did not make me feel good. I didn't understand why at the time. The grief would occupy all of my mind and I found the same thoughts going around and around in my head. They weren't taking me anywhere. No parent should ever have to bury their children but it does happen. Yes of course I get a bite of pain when I see his friends now driving around in cars and wonder what life would be like if he was here. But this next paragraph, I believe, is the key to coping with grief.
On one hand we have sadness, a sense of loss, confusion or maybe even anger. On the other we have pride, treasured memories and admiration. We have a choice which one we can put into our mind. The mind is like a computer. It will take and run whichever program we give it. I wake up on their birthdays and am immediately faced with a choice. THERE IS NO UPSIDE WITH SADNESS. So I swap a sense of loss with a sense of admiration.
Of course I miss them and any psychologist would probably have a field day with me, but when I carry that sense of admiration around with me, and as those beautiful memories come forth, I develop a little inward smile that just radiates my day and lights up everything.

I moved to Australia from the UK just over three years ago for a two year secondment through work. Three months into my adventure here, my Dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The day that they called to tell me, the first thing Dad told me was that he didn't want me to stop having my adventures, that I was to continue living my life as normal and that was what he wanted. So I did. I've settled here and I love my life. This year I've fallen in love for the first time in my life and I should be happier than I have ever been... And some days I am. But my Dad's doctors have run out of options and he is deteriorating fast and I can't handle it. 
I'm going back for a visit soon, taking my boyfriend with me (it is so very important to me that he meets my family and now especially my Dad)... But I can't help but think that I'm going back to say my goodbyes to a man who I love dearly, that will not be around to walk me down the aisle, to see his grandchildren, to see my life here and realise why it makes me want to stay. And I don't know how to say goodbye.
¬†I feel selfish staying here and yet to go back to the UK would mean I'd just be going there to wait for him to pass, which neither him nor me really wants, I'm sure of it. And yet I feel like I've abandoned my family when they need me the most.¬†
¬†I'm just sat at my desk at work crying right now, it's one of my bad days. I get good spells and bad spells and yesterday I got a message from Mum telling me that she thinks I'll be shocked at how much he has deteriorated and it's triggered another down spell... But I feel like I need to be strong for my parents because I'm not even there to see the reality of the situation, dealing with it day to day.
If I can't cope with this, how am I going to cope when the inevitable time comes and he's no longer here?

Hi everyone
I lost my beautiful husband 7 weeks ago in a tragic accident at home.¬† I had not been able to contact him during the morning so came home early from work to find the car he had been working on had crushed him when the jack stands collapsed.
My life has been turned upside down and a good nights sleep is a thing of the past.¬† I am trying to deal with a couple of major issues - finding my gorgeous husband crushed under a car, losing my soulmate (we only met when I was 42 - I am now 55)), a financially motivated step son and people dropping out of my life left, right and centre.
I am struggling to keep my head above water and have sought the assistance of a psychologist.¬† My husband and I never fought as we discussed everything and always came to an agreement about everything.¬† We had a rule that we never went to bed angry and we also parted each day with an ""I love you"".
We spoilt each other rotten and did absolutely everything together so life now is extremely difficult. We were best friends and we crammed so much in our 12 years together that we felt like we had been married for 50 years.¬† In fact, we lived life to the full.
There are probably many more people on here that have sad or tragic stories, so any help you can offer me would be very much appreciated.
Thank you
Donna

I've been handling my mental health problems somewhat better lately. But 2 weeks ago a very good friend took his life whilst struggling with a very bad depression. For 9 or 10 days I cried alot or put it out my head, but at the end of last week that all changed. Whilst there is grief I also have a great deal of fear;¬† that my mind can't cope with it all and I'll become ill and maybe very ill.To let you understand. J, another friend and I were very close friends because of our illness. I'd known J for over 15 years. Because we'd all been in a terrible place we understood each other and I would say that we knew each others illness better than anyone else. For 9 months was very ill and though he has family I was his only other confidant as for whatever reason he didn't want the other friend to know. We weren't constantly in touch but each call was charged with J's illness. Anyway, 2 weeks ago his wife rang to say he had taken his life. He'd never attempted suicide before. I think if he had I could have accepted it more easily but J was the greatest fighter I knew. Thank God I don't feel guilt. As I said I feel frightened. I went to see my gp yesterday. He asked me if I wanted to harm myself - I don't but the question really freaked me out as he never asks me that. I wanted him to say you'll be fine. He said he thinks I'll probably pick up but is seeing me in a month. I am so scared. Suicide frightens me so much and I have a very good idea where J was in his head. People tell me that I'm¬† much better than I realise (I've been recovering for 13 years now). I have no confidence in my mind and I'm scared. The funeral is tomorrow and naturally it will be good to get it by.

Two weeks ago, one of my best friends died. An aneurysm. Sudden. Shocking. She was only 32. I'm moody. Teary. Irritable. So incredibly sad.
I also live with my mother. She has terminal cancer. I try to juggle work (although, now four days a week) and caring for her. This is hard enough. I love her so much. Mum is the nicest, warmest most giving person... ¬†
The loss of my friend has really exposed a nerve. Just so vulnerable and raw. I'm trying to grieve, but without overly affecting my mum. This morning I had ¬†meltdown over boiled eggs. Maybe it's too soon to expect normal 'reasoning'...¬†
I'm trying to live a simple life. Remove myself from stressful situations. I don't want the stresses of my corporate job. It's too much. 
I try to relax doing creative things. I create crochet hats for mum. Booties for my friend's kids. Scarves.¬†
I just feel so overwhelmed with sadness. I hate when people tell me to be strong for my mum. I mean 'wow, really, I'd never thought of that'. ¬†If only it was as simple as putting a smile on my face and everything would be ok. But it just doesn't work that way.
I don't believe in prayer. I don't understand how prayer will fix mum's cancer cells. My father died from cancer 14 years ago. I'm an adult... but I'm an only child. There is no other family to help me.
I think I need reassurance that my emotional state is not 'out of the ordinary' given my circumstances.¬†

this is my first time here. i don't know where to turn as losing my son in January this year has killed my soul. i feel as if i have exhausted all the support i have had around me and i can see how everyone has gotten on with their lives and rightly so, but that's not where my life is at. this is the loneliest feeling i've ever experienced.¬† it's so hard to listen to people talk about the struggles in their lives as i would give anything to swap my struggle with theirs, i find it difficult to not think of their ""complaints or issues"" as quite trivial, in fact but i do recall that given one year ago, i too was one of these people thinking i had problems.¬† how a day can change your life, actually not even a day, just those crucial few minutes that you wish you could take back and change.¬† i wish i had a mundane life again with trivial complaints.¬† i feel the only place to turn now is here, where i can be anonymous, where maybe there is someone else feeling what i am feeling to help ease my feelings of loneliness.¬† i don't like it when people say i'm looking good, that doesn't feel like a compliment at all, it feels as if losing my son doesn't matter at all and i have just moved on with life and superficial appearances....even though i know full well that's not at all what they meant.¬† i just cant be happy about anything any more.¬† i also despise it when people say i need to look after myself now and get on with my life.....how offended i am when people tell me that !¬† let them walk in my shoes and see if they feel like just moving on with life as if they just lost a job or something bearable like that.¬† there's no joy, no passion, no excitement, i'm just an empty shell without my baby boy and can't see the light.¬†

Hi all, this is the first time I have posted one here..
My partner is 24 and last year his twin brother tragically died in a motorbike accident. He is very good at covering up his feelings. He refuses to cry or show his pain around me. Although he does open up and cry around his mates it doesn't happen often.
I have tried multiple times to get him to seek some counselling as I can see it is affecting him. He drinks a lot and is very angry when drunk (he has never hurt me but always seems to pick fights). Last night while at the pub, he opened up to a girl who he went to primary school with and told her he plans to kill himself on his birthday which is in September.
Hes away this weekend on a 'boys weekend' so I haven't had the chance to talk to him about it, and he has no idea that I even know. I have spoken to his Aunty and Uncle who are helping me support him and we are trying to workout where to go from here. He refuses any sort of counselling and says he is fine.
We have a 13 month old son and it really hurts me that he thinks its fine to leave myself and our son in this world alone.. I suffer from mild depression myself..
Im also worried he may have bipolar as his mother does and his attitude is much like hers..

I lost my best friend in 2008 in a tragic helicopter accident that I was suppose to have been on but didn't as my one year old at the time was unwell. This was devastating to me and for many years I struggled with her passing. Too young and too many things in life yet to complete and achieve. I cant help but think that I was not there in that moment for a reason.
I lost my grandmother who grew me up from a infant. I was holding her hand when she passed. She is always in my memory and my heart and thoughts.
Its been 7 years since l lost my best friend and 2 years since I lost my grandmother who both played a very important role in my life.¬†
I struggle at times but its made me realize that life is too short and all I want is to be simply be happy and love life with the people I have in it.¬†
The journey has been hard and long but I've finally overcome the loss. I miss them and shed tears when I think of them but I know they would want me to be happy and to make the most of my life.

Hi I lostmy daughter Ashleigh, August 7th 2009.. And I still struggle with overwhelming grief without her.. Flashbacks of that day..
she was born with a congenital heart condition, had 4 open heart ops.. And lots of hospital stays in her 16yrs.. She was a little fighter... And 09 her health went down hill with pulmonary hypertension, and she was looking aga heart lung transplant.. It was such a shock! She decided to do all tests for transplant.. And it was then we realised her pacemaker was getting close to being replaced.. And they weren't wrong.. A week later we were back and waiting for adr and anethasist to do her surgery.. Took 2 wks before they did it, and she got so much sicker waiting...I walked up with her to the theatre.. She was so looking forward to feeling better.. As she lay there, I mouthed to her, I LOVE YOU.. She nodded at me with a smile on herf face.. It was only 20 mins later we got called back, because they were trying to revive her.. Complications with surgery and the hypertension... They managed to revive her.. And she went up to icu..¬†
They had stabilised her and our dr said they were going to let her sleep over wkend.. But when we went in the nurses were till weaning her off, and slowly waking her!! The icu dr had not relayed anything of what ourdr had said.l.. And then when they did her obs, she got startled and things were beeping everywhere!! I was telling her I was there with her... And then they sent me out..6pm we lost our beautiful Ash... We miss her so much,and some days I really struggle... I haves great husband, a a great faith, but some days it's not enough!!! I wishi could of taken her place..I dontbelieve she's in heaven watching over me, and I hate it when people say that.. Because really, if Ash saw how much we were suffering, and how much she was missing, she would be devastated.... ¬†How do any of you out there cope.. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi!
My parents are in their late 50's. They are in good health and there is no reason I believe they will be passing sooner rather than later.¬†
However, I worry about how I will deal with their eventual death. I have a history of depression and anxiety, and my folks have been a huge support. I'm concerned that losing them would be a huge blow and I would struggle to cope with their loss.¬†
Does anyone have any tips for how to prepare for the death of loved one's? More so, in the long term. If you have lost a loved one, was there anything in particular you struggled with, or wish you'd come to be aware of sooner?
¬†Cheers!

I am 32, with a wife and 18 month old son which I love very much. Just over 2 years to the day I lost my father unexpectingly. Loneliness, grief, sadness, longing are all emotions I feel every day. 2 years has passed and things don't seem to get any easier. I know nothing will change and I can't bring it back but I need to move forward to help, support and love my family.
I finally found the courage and saw a counsellor. The first few visits have been productive and helpful and I will continue for a few more visits. I hope my lack of communication, distancing myself and troubles have not caused a divide in my relationship with my wife that can't be fixed. Although seeing a counsellor has been productive I wish I could share my feelings and thoughts with my family as they are my life.
I have written this to share my thoughts rather than keep them to myself and am not specifically after any feedback.

My Dad passed suddenly a few years ago and I don't think I've been the same since. ¬†I miss him terribly, and even though the raw feelings of grief have eased, I have this constant nagging fear that I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop - so to speak. ¬†Who's next? ¬†What's next? ¬†Since my Dad passed I have been the primary carer for my Mum, whom I love dearly. ¬†I am so worried about her, all the time. ¬†Has she taken her medication? ¬†Has she had a fall? ¬†My husband is wonderful, he's my rock. We don't have kids (we are unable to) and I worry about him, all the time. ¬†Is he ok? ¬†Has he been in accident? ¬†I love my pets so ¬†much. ¬†Unfortunately, they are elderly now too and I worry about them, all the time. ¬†Will they be alive when I get home? ¬†My job involves caring for the elderly with disabilities. ¬†That in itself is stressful. ¬†
The time before my Dad passed now seems like a distant, foggy memory. ¬†Even though I've always had social anxiety, I'm pretty sure I used to be happy quite a bit and maybe even carefree at times. ¬†Now, I dread getting out of bed. ¬†I don't have any close friends, and I hardly ever hear from my 2 sisters. ¬†Rarely a day passes when I'm not on the verge of tears. ¬†I don't have any motivation. ¬†I feel like I'm not living, just existing, waiting for the next inevitable tragedy. ¬†
I hope someone reading this can understand, as I've almost given up hope that my life will ever be any different.
Thank you for taking the time to read my story :)¬†

This will probably seem really stupid to most people but my dog is getting old and I find myself dwelling on what to do if she dies. She was recently diagnosed with a mid-range heart murmur soI now worry about her all of the time, I don't want to lose her, I just want her to live forever and be with me in my life. ¬†My dog is so much to me and I can't imagine what my life would be like without her in it. ¬†I adopted her two years ago and my depression has been much better with her in my life, she makes me happy and I love her so much, she is just like this burst of joy that I was lucky enough to have come into my life, I still can't believe I was so lucky that noone else wanted her and I was able to have her, I feel like she was meant to be with me and I was meant to be with her. ¬†Even when she is just sitting beside me having a snooze, like now, I feel 100% better, I don't know what to do if she dies or how to cope with losing her. ¬†I don't know if I should bury her or have her cremated, I worry about ¬†what bad things may happen to her soul if she is buried or cremated. Not sure if anyone can help.

... But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied.
Never believe it:
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:Here's yet some liquor left. ¬†¬†

As thou'rt a man,
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
To tell my story. 
Hamlet
For those who follow these post, you might know that my dear son Nick hastened into this god night. Well, it is now almost 6 months ago, but only last night.¬†
But I feel cursed. Suicide seems a family trait.My father. my son, others. These past few months have been as bad as you can imagine. Oh, I have a few supportive friends, a partner who tolerates and cares for me in equal measure and doctors who are wise in when to express sympathy and when to challenge. Most others are useless. My bosses way of support was to advise that they didn't feel I'm ""a good fit"" at this time. I little cared. We maddies are use to platitudes.¬†
¬†Anyway, I'm posting this by way of reassuring BB online monitors, who I feared interpreted a previous post that I may be suicidal. To praraphrase one of my favourite TV shows Sling and Arrows, when the lead character Geoffory Tennant is ask by a Police Officer after a pub brawl if he is a suicide risk, he quibs ""isn't everybody"" But for myself,I'm more like Haratio than Hamlet. I wish I wasn't. And there are never gurrantees. My doctor finds it acceptable that I've no wish to add to his gallery of the dead but it is a professional hazard. ¬†He sort to reassure me that my father and son would have been in a dissociatiated state when they died. I'm not completely convinced. I certainly reserve it for myself to die I chose clear headed. But we have a safety plan; I report in, take my medication, follow advice and stay away from dangerous locations.
I find solance is Ophelia's lament. ""And
will he not come again?
And
will he not come again?
No,
no, he is dead:
Go
to thy death-bed:
He
never will come again.
His
beard was as white as snow,
All
flaxen was his poll:
He
is gone, he is gone,
And
we cast away moan:
God
ha' mercy on his soul!
And
of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.""¬†
Anyway, allow me m pain. It tells me Nick was alive and I loved him. Its my journey and I would wish anyone else to join me.

Hi there,1 month ago, I lost my grandfather to cancer. It was sad, but it was his time and the family has accepted this loss and is moving forward, last week I lost my cousin who was 33 and fit as a fiddle, He leaves behind his 2 year old baby girl and a pregnant wife with their unborn child. The day after I found out about my cousin, who I spent countless days and nights playing with when younger, my girlfriend broke up with me. She said she didnt want to be in a relationship, and that was that. It happened so quickly and there has been no closure. Whats even worse, she did it over the phone and ultimately, via a text message. I have borken off all contact, but she hasnt attempted to msg me in over a week now. So its not looking good.¬†

My depression started 22yrs ago with the death of my first son but it wasn't diagnosed until the following year when I had twins and the doctor thought it was post natal depression. I have been taking anti depressants ever since and can't go off them as I plummet down to the depths of despair if I try. I have a chemical imbalance in my brain so need the pills to fix it.
10 yrs ago my beloved husband was taken by cancer and I died that day too. I was left with 10 yrs old twins to raise so I put my life on hold making sure they were ok. In 2010 I decided to start dating again and had 2 disasters.
the first was still married and the second turned out to be a serial conman who took me for $20000. I will never trust any man again.
my son has been a very troubled boy since his dad died. He smoked weed but got off it but substituted it with alcohol. He's now lost his driving licence on 1 yr probation and has to do 40 hrs community service. He still hasn't learnt a lesson thought and goes out boozing all the time. He'll end up in jail one day.
i am so very lonely and sad all the time. I force myself to go out but don't enjoy anything. I sit alone at night crying and long to be with my husband again. I would've thought I would be past this by now but it doesn't pass. I guess I just learnt to live with it. It doesn't SMTP me being lonely though. I don't have anyone to talk to as my family and friends live 16000 miles away on the other side of the world.
i know I need help to feel better. Nobody knows about this. It's my secret. Everyone thinks I'm a strong woman but alone I'm a wreck. Can you pls help?

I must have walked under a ladder with a black cat on Friday the 13th. ¬†Since 2007 my life has been one setback after another. ¬†My sister-in-law passed away from cancer early that year at the young age of 51. ¬†Later that year, my husband and I separated after 35 years together. ¬†We had grown apart and no longer made each other happy. ¬†I retained the marital home in our financial settlement. ¬†Our separation was very amicable and we remained good friends. ¬†I continued to work four days a week until in 2008 a change in administration had me answerable to the supervisor from hell. ¬†She made my life miserable in a job I had held happily and successfully for 17 years. ¬†I tried to battle through this but it was soul-destroying. ¬†In 2009 my son went on an extended overseas holiday and he is now a resident of Canada. ¬†I miss him terribly. ¬†In 2010 my husband announced that he had a new 'companion'. ¬†This news was hard for me to hear, but I knew one of us would eventually move on. ¬†He went overseas with her and on his return, told me that he was having some health issues. ¬†He was diagnosed with bowel cancer and passed away in early 2012. ¬†He left his estate to our children. ¬†I was not a beneficiary. ¬†Later that year, my working life had become intolerable. ¬†I walked out and ended up in a doctor's office shaking with anxiety. ¬†I was granted sick leave which then extended into leave without pay until I was forced to relinquish my position at the end of 2014. ¬†Since then I have been doing a little casual work and with my savings dwindling, have resorted to Centrelink for help. ¬†At the age of 61 - 5 1/2 years too young for the aged pension, I am now on New Start allowance and am looking for work. ¬†The problem is, I am so depressed about my situation that I don't even want to get out of bed! ¬†I do not want to burden my family with my problems. ¬†I am embarrassed and ashamed that my life has come to this. ¬†To top it all off, I have now discovered that I have termites in my house which is my only asset. ¬†I know there are people out there who are worse off than me but I can't see any light at the end of the tunnel and I just wish the Earth would swallow me up. ¬†I adore my two children and don't want to cause them any pain....they are the only bright light in my life. ¬†Please help me!!! ¬†How can I rise above this?????beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

My son took
his own life not long after the New Year.¬†
He was 22 years of age. As a child he was diagnosed as having ADHD and
later this was clarified as Asperger's syndrome.¬† He was to experience learning difficulties,
his parents‚Äô divorce, his mother dying much too soon, having to take what work
might be offered and various tribulations of life.
As you can
imagine I miss his more than be imagined. I have other children whom I need to
be available for. My friends and partner, and my own medical professionals have
sought to help me. I take each day as it comes, but with each day the
realisation that my son is gone.
This is not what I want to talk about. But the context. What keeps
distressing me is every time I see some article in the newspaper or professional
journal asserting that suicide among young people is getting worse. Only this
week, I felt anger when I heard a welfare professional on the radio claim that young people were more likely to kill themselves
than die in a car crash. I wanted to
yell at them that there has
been a fantastic improvement in reducing suicides, but even more dramatically
reduction in road fatalities.
¬†
My partner thinks this anger is just my sense of grief.
My doctor nods wisely advising that we know folk twist things to get media
attention. I‚Äôm still left with my anger. I have told my doctor that I was responsible
for keeping my son safe. My doctor at least offers I would feel like that,
instead of most folk lamely say I did the best I could. Even if I did, he is
still dead.
¬†
My son sought
medical advice on his own initiative about the increased anxiety he was experiencing.
He took the prescription medication he was prescribed.¬† I had accompanied him to see a clinical psychologist
and did not miss any appointments. I‚Äôd helped to arrive had also enrolled in a TAFE
course. Spent increasing time with him, listened, reassured, tried to get him
to come out places. He‚Äôd sometimes come to my partners for dinner, to the
cinema, cooked together, but other times said he was tired and just wanted to stay
home. It still wasn‚Äôt enough.
¬†
But it
is people who know better lying about statistics that angers me. I can‚Äôt change
this. I hate those who tried to big note themselves by making a horrible
situation worse. I really hate them! I miss my son. I want him back.

I lost my father three months ago, he was diagnosed with bone, lung and liver cancer in December 2014. It was so unexpected to hear he was so unwell and it was so serious. I was away on holidays when he was diagnosed and given only two months left on this earth. He made my family promise not to say anything to me until I got home. This was the first news I heard when I came home, my dad was in hospital from the unbearable pain. I didn't know how to cope with the news and tried to pretend it wasn't happening. We brought dad home from hospital and got to spend my brother's birthday, Christmas, New Years and Australia Day as a family. These were the moments we all cherished and held onto so tightly. The two months we got were so full of life, dad always stayed positive and tried to make everyone laugh on a daily basis. Dad became more and more ill and eventually had to be admitted to hospital for pain management. On the day he passed we were expecting to bring him back home and he was so excited to be coming home. This was such a big shock for everyone as he was so bright the day before. I spent almost the entire day by his bedside and didn't want to leave him. It's been three long painful months and I still miss him everyday and expect him to walk through the door with a big smile on his face. It's been so difficult trying to deal with the grief and be able to talk about how I feel. I'm also at university in my third year of studies and my focus this semester is completely gone. I feel upset everyday and don't know what to do? I love and miss my dad so much! I'm only 21, he is going to miss out in so many life events :(¬†

Hello,
In 2012, I lost my Mum a week before school started to liver failure. I did not know what to do, I felt so overwhelmed and I did not want to go to school, however my Dad thought the support there would be good so I went. A month later, my good friend was in a terrible car accident and passed away. I couldn't go to school anymore. The thought of him not being in the classroom shattered me. I got really sick with anxiety and depression and didn't go to school much. Later that year my Grandpa passed away of a heart attack.¬†
I started to get better, things were starting to get on track. However at the end of last year, my step grandpa who had been my swimming coach for nine years passed away.
I am lost. I do not know what to do. I hate these feelings I have and I cannot let go of them. I miss them so much. Why does death take away the most beautiful people? They didn't need to die yet, they had so much more time to live. I don't understand. I hate getting close to people now, I am afraid they too will disappear on me.¬†
I miss them so much.¬†

I lost my last remaining close family member almost a year ago. She was my rock, who loved me for everything that I was and everything that I wasn't, truly unconditional love. This has obviously been a massive jolt to my system, especially as I am the kind of person who people would not necessarily believe would suffer from a lack of self-esteem; I am outgoing, play lots of sports and have a job which requires me to be 'forthright'. However, lack of self-esteem I do sometimes have, and like all of those types of things, this is worse when I am under stress, tired, etc. To lose her lost me my final back-stop, the one person who had known me all my life and loved me without reserve.
I have friends, one of whom is amazing at putting things into perspective but she lives in the UK, has a family and with time-zone differences, I don't like to bother her too much. I have a couple of good friends here but they have busy lives also and I don't want to 'use-up' all their time.
I started my first same-sex relationship a few days before Wendy died (my first relationship in 15 years) and it has not been smooth sailing. She is a great person but we are very different and i can't tell if some of the problems between us are caused by my grief, by the differences between us or other factors.
I am afraid that I am staying in a relationship I am not suited to in order to have someone there, to compensate for my loss and am willing to put up with a damaging relationship to not be completely alone.
In the same vein but opposite side, I am afraid to let it go as we still seem to have something¬† special but are having what are normal relationship difficulties but i can't deal with them because I a) haven't ever really been in a 'proper' relationship and b) I'm a bit all over the place with grief.
I can't deny that we are very different, she is very scientific in her thinking and American and I am more spiritual, a feeling person and english by birth. But I am very scared of losing something special that just needs a bit of work and suffered from the trauma of my loss but at the same time I am also worried that my grief is being made worse by my possibly staying in a relationship that isn't good for me and is making my emotional instability worse; I really am in a quandry and trying to work it all out.
Thanks for this forum, it has helped just to 'say it out loud' so to speak.

I've always known I was one of twins. My wee brother John died 24 hours old. My Dad was the only one to see him. We were born 12 weeks prem. There is no grave or marker for John. My Dad said he went up in smoke like comes out of a chimney. I've now found out theres no record for him either. No stillborn record looked. No birth certificate record looked. No death certificate record looked. My wee twin John who is part of me , been part of me all my life, who has lived with me. Never recorded? Is there no official paperwork for wee John. Are we the family the only ones who know. So that when we all die no one will know he was. I have no one to ask my parents are now dead . Him and I against the world and against and for each other. Funny but he and I have had a love and hate relationship all along. He's me and I'm him.

My fianc√©e passed away unexpectedly a year ago... I am now struggling with having a purpose - I feel like the life I wanted and all our dreams disappeared with my love. Whilst I have friends and family around I am desperately lonely and can't really see a purpose anymore. I just feel lost - how do I pull myself back into life?

Ok, so I was wrong.
I was posting to another member the other day (it could well have been Alan) and saying that my Mum sadly left this world on 14th October 2014 and that next week (ie:¬† today) will be 6 months to the exact day.¬† I said that I would be no sadder on that day than I've been already.
But I was wrong.
I'm down, well I have been for a fair while now, but I'm down and it feels like the black dog has got hob-nailed boots on all four paws and he's booting me.
It'll pass I guess, but at the moment, things ain't good.
I try and focus on the good times, but for me, that doesn't work just yet.¬† Way too early.

I lost my dad 18 November 2014. I have hurt every day since. 31, daddy's girl, married - facing losing my husband because of my grief. I can't even see that it's that bad, yeah I'm sad and just going say to day, but I can't even see the hurt I'm causing around me, or the spark that has gone from within myself.
i get upset, I get angry, it's unfair, I feel like lying in bed all day, I want to be alone... All of these things I think and feel. I have been told theres a two month waiting list for counselling in my area - great! I feel like I'm about to lose everything....

What happened today?It was my brother's birthday today. He would have been 21. I still feel so incomplete about his passing. ¬†I remember the night quite well. It's emblazoned into my brain for eternity and it haunts me all the time.This day, every year, is still so incredibly hard. ¬†I can't remember a time when we celebrated that day as a family after he passed. ¬†It is/was so hard. Too damn hard. If I set my mind loose about my brother, it is always brought back to the night that he died. I was 12. He was 6. I remember seeing this tiny child in my mother's arms, tubes and wires going everywhere.I didn't believe that he was going to die.He always pulled through everything.My brother, the fighter.I remember becoming concerned when I saw a Doctor talking to mum, the Doctor broke down in tears and I just knew this was the end. I ran to my brother and pleaded and pleaded with him not to go.Pleaded that I would be a better sister and that I would protect him more.I pleaded so hard, I even said prayers to God, even though it had been a very long time since I had come close to saying a prayer. I prayed and prayed and prayed. I watched them pull around the curtains. I frantically pleaded with my brother not to go, not to leave me. ¬†I remember looking up at the monitors and looking at his heart rate.I remember the number 186 His little heart was beating 186 beats a minute.Then I saw the numbers ¬†fall.We were losing him.I remember the nurse turning off all the monitors and alarms and left the bedside.I remember hysterically pleading with him to not go, that we had a lifetime of things to do together.I was beyond hysterical.What was I going to do with out him?. I remember seeing a lifeless little body, my brother was dead. This is why I don't do anything on my brother's birthday. ¬†Every time I think of him, this is what I remember. I can't get it out of my head. ¬†It's like it's burnt forever in my memory, those thoughts and memories aren't going anywhere. ¬† It's too HARD to celebrate when this is what I think of when this time of year comes around. LIFE IS TOO HARD. LIFE IS UNFORGIVING. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. Why are you sad? I DON'T KNOW. What's wrong? I DON'T KNOW. ¬†I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ANYMORE. I feel defeated. And hopeless. Why?

We found my mum passed away on Christmas Day 2014, cause still unknown. On top of it, my brother and I are looking after everything as mum was divorced a year before this after 35 years of marriage. I wish I got time to say a proper good bye, the shock has been intense. This is on top of various family issues.
¬†I want to try and make sure that everyone makes the most of time with their loved ones. This grief is unbelievable especially with the sudden and unexpected circumstances. There's a big hole in my life and I know it'll get better. I'm very fortunate to have beautiful friends and colleagues. I don't know how I'd have survived without these people.
One strange thing is, the very little information on grieving when this happens (direct contact) I'm still waiting nearly 3 months later for counselling via the coroners court, although I ended up sourcing out my own.
I now cry every time I see a news article on accidents, or sudden deaths, feeling for the family that weren't able to tell the deceased how they feel. I feel for those family members and friends so much.

Have started writing this a number of times now, and am not
sure where to start so I guess I‚Äôll jump right in...
My parents passed away within 5 weeks of each other last
year. ¬†Mum passed first, which came as quite
a shock, as although she had emphysema we had been told time and time again by
the specialists that she was not anywhere near end stage yet.¬† Dad had dementia, so we made the tough
decision not to tell him mum had passed as he was at long last settled in a
care home, and hadn‚Äôt known mum the last time she had visited.¬† We felt he had had a tough enough time and it
would only cause him unnecessary distress.¬†
But it would seem that after 50 plus years of marriage there are ties that
dementia cannot destroy as on the day of my mums funeral, my dad turned to one
of his carers and said ‚Äúyou know my wife is gone‚Äù.¬† From that moment, he moved quickly through
the end stages of dementia, stopped eating and drinking, and slowly slipped
away from us over the following weeks.¬†
The best thing we could do for him was to make sure he was not in any
pain and let him know it was ok to go, after years of mental torment it was
time for him to find peace.¬† I thought I
was ready for losing dad, I had mourned our relationship years ago, when he no
longer recognised me ‚Äì although I still felt there was always an emotional
connection when I saw him.¬† I know now
you are never fully prepared.
I have good days and bad, and had actually felt I was doing
really well as this year started, but the last couple of days have been tough, I
have found myself exhausted and the tears have started flowing again...¬† It would have been their 53rd
wedding anniversary in the middle of Feb, and around this time last year was
the last time I spent any quality time with my mum ‚Äì I‚Äôm an ex-pat so all my
family are overseas.¬† I have a great
doctor and have been for counselling and I know everything I‚Äôm experiencing is
a normal part of the grieving process.¬† I
also know how lucky I am to have had both my parents with me for so long.¬† I just needed an outlet today so hope it‚Äôs ok
to share on here, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who is experiencing this sort
of situation so maybe it will help others to know they‚Äôre not alone.

I just don't know what to do. I've been married for 2 years, together for 10, and now my husband says he's no longer in love with me. We have a 2 year old child and hubby is sleeping in another bed the past couple weeks. Yesterday he told me he's been happier since doing this. We've both seen a counsellor individually a couple times and hubby admits he's depressed. I'm pretty sure it's mostly based on relationship issues we've had for 3 years or so (I think I got depressed after my Dad died and then I possibly got postnatal depression too and somehow put up walls against intimacy, so barely any sex. He then felt rejected and now no longer loves me. We've been together since we were 18). It's just that I love him so very much and haven't shown it and now I'm scared it's too late. He's leaning towards separation and has even taken his wedding ring off. There was also a brief infidelity moment on his part, I guess because he felt so emotionally rejected himself. He says he isn't sure what he wants which is why he's still living with us, but the counsellor makes him question things but he's no longer sexually attracted to me either. He has mentioned not making any big decisions until he is sure but I feel so hopeless sometimes. I feel so rejected. We also work together. He has brought up such issues of splitting our belongingings and who should get what and seems to think too much water has passed under the bridge but is being plenty nice to me. I don't know how to deal with my pain. I really want us to try and work through this and love each other again (a long road I know), but he just seems genuinely like he's lost those feelings. Do I just give up? I feel like he's going to move out soon. I've tried to back off but have told him I'm there and I won't give up. But I'm gutted and just don't know what to do. I feel like giving up. He really is the love of my life.¬†

I always think I am crazy, grieving for my Grandparents when they are still alive. Last night I cried myself to sleep because I do not want to lose my Grandma. Because of situations, my maternal Grandparents practically raised myself and my brothers. Their home was a safe haven; a happy place. Whether we were inside in the kitchen with Grandma or outside in the paddocks with Grandpa...those are my favourite memories. I haven't been particularly close to my own Mum because events made her very reserved and in her own little world. So when I needed someone to talk to (especially a female) I would go to my Grandma.I would talk to her about my struggles, my broken heart, dreams that I had. Grandma never passed judgment, only kindness and love. However, she was strong enough to correct me if she thought I needed it. She taught me everything that a young lady needs to know in life. The last couple years her memory has been getting rather bad. At first it was just little things, but now she can hardly put sentences together. It's like she knows what she wants to say, just doesn't know how to say them anymore. Apparently she is having lots of little strokes at the front of her brain which affects her thinking ability. It breaks my heart to see this beautiful woman slipping away. I have tried not to question and not to get angry at God but I can't help it. I honestly don't know how I am going to cope without her. She is my Grandma, my sister by heart, my angel and my best friend. I almost wish I didn't love so much because then it wouldn't hurt so. When I was little and they would go on holidays; I would go into total shut down mode. I would not eat or sleep, so in the end they would take me with them. All I know is that when they (my Grandparents) got to their eternal home; I want to go with them.

Recently our family has undergone several deaths , my husbands grandfather, my stepfather and a close friend. I have over 20 years having had depression, and it has been diagnosed. I am finding lately i am continually worried about when my own time will be. I know that no one has the answer to when or how, and i understand it is nature, but i am so focussed on the fact that one day i wont be here and this is causing me so much grief and anxiety. I havea wonderful husband, and a three year old son, and the thought of not seeing them makes me have anxiety attacks. I am having morbid thoughts about it, and it is impacting my ability to enjoy life fully im focussed almost obsessing over it. I don't know if this is a phobia, my psychologist is on maternity leave so i am looking for a new one, and i don't want them to think im weird, finding someone i trust is really important to me. My own parents are aging, and the thought that one day i too will age, and die is so painful for me. What can I do? Are there any suggestions out there for how to help me deal with this continual worry? How can i get over these feelings?

i have a huge heaviness in my heart these days. im 21 years old and have just found out my father has a very agressive cancer and has been told by doctors that they cannot cure him of cancer only help maintain ¬†quality of life for as long as possible. i dont even know how to handle the emotions surrounding this issue. i live 4 hours away from him with my partner, whom ive been with for 4 years and starting to build a life with. my first instinct was wanting to go home to my family, but my dad does not want this and my partner cannot come with me if i chose to go. but my heart is tearing my in so many direction.
on a different note my partner is so unhappy. i have no idea what is going on im trying to be there and be understanding,and try to support his life plans for us, but i have so much sadness in my heart right now i dont know how to hold things together for the both of us its all becoming so hard and stressfull. and there seems so be no happiness in our lives right now and i really dont want everything to come crumbeling down :( please can anyone relate !

my dog was hit by a car today. I feel like it was my fault because she jumped out the car window just after I had parked. She's never done that before. She died instantly. I was at my daughter's place. I made her go out to the road. I couldn't look. It was so terrible. We are all grieving her loss. I lost another dog a few years ago. I actually ran over him. I lost the plot and ended up in hospital. I just hope that this won't send me over again. All I can think is what if! Why did I put the window down? It's terrible. She was my husband's little girl. I'm just feeling so terrible. My heart is aching for everyone and a dear sweet little dog who shouldn't have died like that.

My partner and I recently lost our bubba at 15 weeks pregnant. ¬†The grief of this has torn us apart after nearly three years together. We are in our late teens/early twenties, which complicates it further being young. I have both diagnosed anxiety and depression prior to this event. I strongly suspect my partner has both too but I can't support him in a way that can convince him to get any help and I am very concerned as he has spoken openly of sucide.¬†
I have reached breaking point with this and other stresses in my life.
I guess im just hoping someone who has been through something similar might have some advice to offer.
Thanks either way

Hi There,On Saturday I had the police turn up at my work to inform¬†me that¬†my Nan had died.¬†¬†This all comes at a time where my psychologist had started lengthening the time between our appointments because she thought I was doing so well and was well on my way to recovery since ahuge depression/anxiety bout last year. My doctor also impressed with my improvement said she would look at reducing my antidepressants with the view of weaning off them all together later on in the year if I kept doing well. I also decided to leave the comfort of my salary job to go to TAFE to study this year which was a huge step for me.¬†Now, I feel like I'm not doing well with the grief. I can't cry but yet my emotions are on the boiling point. I'm sleeping but it feels like I haven't slept at all. I'm even falling asleep at my desk or even on the floor of the bathroom at work today. I'm constantly exhausted and everything is an effort. Its a huge effort to get out of bed in the morning and my partner forces me to get up. I don't want to slip back to where I was. I saw my psychologist yesterday to help but we could only cover so much. I see her again next week. She said that these things are normal signs of grief and just to go back to basics to get through this hard time.¬†Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with grief, how not to slip back into the dark cloud of anxiety and depression (especially since mine was based on separation and bad things happening to those I love). I just can't get the horrible picture of my Nan dying scared and alone out of my head and its even haunting my dreams :(¬†

This year is 3 years since my mother passed of cancer. It was so bad and I'm so pissed off. they like found something ages before but said it was nothing and then 2012 she had a fall at home and was having seizures and I was in shock and crying and then she went to hospital and then they found lumps on her brain and then it just spread every were and in the blood and then she went down hill. I was lucky anuff that there was a trial drug and that gave her months till she passed Jan 2013 in that time I saw her go from what she was to what she ended up like she was. She ended up having lots of seizures but there was nothing any one could do. I didn't even like spending time with my own mother as I would worry that she would have a seizure and that felt bad. I was an still am grateful my grandma and her partner could take her in and look after her. My mum ended up having one more seizure and ended up in hospital and couldn't talk or swallow and got annoyed cause she couldn't go to the toilet by her self. In the end she was not given any pain meds and then went peacefully. I'm glad she got to meet my now husband and new he would look after me. Im glad he was and is my rock. I now have anxiety and depression and agoraphobia. it was really bad. I used to be able to not be left alone and now i can stay at home by my self. I'm having trouble going out to places by myself as I think something bad will happen. I've just been able to go round the block and down into the servo. I cant go anywhere else by myself. Its relay hard as my hubby cant get work unless its at night when I'm asleep. I have to have a phone with me so i feel safe. I had a baby and it hurts that my mums not here to see her to hold her to hear her talk to find out her name. she always wanted me to have kids ¬†and now I have one its hard shes not here as she would of been so good with her. I get sad when other ladies who are around mums age hold her and it makes me want to see that with my mum. I find it hard some time to look after my own baby sometimes when i used to be really good with babies. I have a amazing friend whose like the big sister I never had and she has been through things with me and that's helped having a female around. I also have a neighbor who kind of reminds me of my own mum and its nice to go sit with her.¬†
¬†even thought I have these women and am very great full for them I still feel lost hurt and some days just want to cry and do cry. I find it hard to get up in the morning.

Today I lost my dad. He was diagnosed with cancer 3 weeks ago and he died today. We were able to look after him at home for the last week. I'm extremely close to my father. I became sick in my early 20's and my parents looked after me. I left home for a while but then my mum and dad had health issues so I moved back in with them for the last few years.
I'm feeling a complete overwhelming panic. I don't know how I'm going to continue without him. He was the strong one in the family. I still suffer with my health and my mum is quite weak. How do I stop the panic? The thought that I don't know how we are going to cope without him. I feel so numb. I still can't believe he has gone. I feel like I'm pretending he is just away or in hospital. How do I keep the panic at bay? How do I do this? How do I keep going with just my mum and me. I'm so grateful I still have her but they were extemely close. Married 59 years. What if I lose her then I'm completely alone. I don't do alone well. And I don't have anyone that I can get to move in. I'm terrified of being alone and now with dad gone I feel it's just a matter of time. My health really hampers being able to do things and get out of the house. 
¬†What do I do how do I get past this huge thing that has happened. He hasn't even been gone for a day yet and I'm already a wreck.

Hello,
I am new to this, really, I have no ideas what I am even going to say. I am not sure how to deal with my shock and sadness. I am however seeing a doctor and a counselor (for bipolar, depression, anxiety and follow-up DV from 2 years ago). 
I figured on here wont hurt!¬†
2 months ago we found out my father (73) had terminal cancer, 5 weeks later he passed away, 13 days later my husband left me and drained all of our bank accounts. This was my 2nd marriage, we only been married 2.5 years - this is the 4th time he had left me. 
I have been delivered the cruelest double wammy.
I miss my Dad more than I could ever have imagined. He was always there to celebrate my achievements, to deal with my issues, he¬†was my rock when things went wrong in my life. But I feel like I have been robbed my grieving time and energy for my father, as I am hurt and trying to work out what to do now my husband has gone.¬†
Is this something that happens ... ever? 
Do some people just decide it will be too hard to support their spouse as they grieve the loss of their loved ones?¬†

Hi,
Quote from a funeral director on a Billy Connelly show tonight ""Grief is like a doorway...so high you cant climb over it, so wide you cant go around it, so deep you cant go under it....YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT""
And quote from Billy Connolly ""If death was with us everyday....we wouldnt care so much about it"" 
They say on average a person undergoes grief from a death every 10 years. But they didnt include marriage/partner breakups. And girlfriend/boyfriend splits that can have just as devastating effects. 
If we were to 'expect' a death of a loved one and (sort of) accept that we will experience such grief, then maybe we can semi plan for how we are to manage our feelings at that time.¬† This sounds great eh? Planning your grief routine, What rubbish!!! Lets re-read that first quote about the door of grief....you have to go through it!
But if we do accept that we will ""go through it"" - the deaths of close ones and lets say none of these cases are any less devastating than the last, then perhaps we can expect it to happen. Wouldnt that assist in some way? Perhaps, perhaps not. for we know that everyone is different in this terrible experience of grief.
One thing that has helped me and might help you, is to take that loss you are experiencing- to the extreme. For example-
When my brother died in 1979 at 27 from his own hand, my mother at the time said ""I've lost a son, not many people lose a child"". At the time I lived in a unit and 3 doors down from me was a couple that came from Queensland. Eventually they told me their story which included the fact that in one car accident they lost 3 children and the ladies mother and father. Thirteen years later my father died and my mother said ""not many people lose a husband and a son"". I reminded her of that example. It didnt sooth her pain but it became a baby step to recovery. At a time when one feels they have been inflicted with the worst of all blows, it could indeed be worse. And the hands that embrace you at a service for the lost one...those hands are there while some people lose so many members of their family in one swoop or within a short space of time, it is a positive of sorts that it could be worse.
Yes, you have to go through it. Grief is not avoidable for most of us. Even the seemingly toughest person on earth cant avoid it. But it is part of us on earth in this life and we will never rid ourselves of the shock, the despair and the sheer loss.
But in some cases, it could be worse.

To You, My Dad, John. 11-12-64 ~ 5-12-92 ¬† 22 years today it's been since you left.¬† Left the physical world, left your uncertainties, left your own life. The years pass, and I get older and time changes most things, But never the fact that you're not here. Nothing will ever change that and it never gets any easier. In your absence and as the years pass, I've learned so much about reality and life's short comings, But mostly about what happens when finality kicks in. There's no closure, no questions answered and no bringing you back to tell us why!!! And with that I realised quite quickly in my young life that there's nothing myself or anyone else can do about it. So what do we do?? Lose grip on reality and live a life We can blame on tragedy and the downfalls?? No chance. We keep living and fighting with a cause.¬† Im not delusional and I know I can't make miracles happen, but I take losing you, the uncertainties, the sadness and all the unknowns and I channel them and use them as power & ammunition for me to get through my days. I refuse to lose or be beaten, I will never wallow in self pity or blame anyone or anything for my downfalls and losses, I live a life I'm proud of, And try to make the world a better place. I struggle, I fall, I hate life sometimes. It's reality, it's life, But despite the struggle, life is always worth staying and fighting for, your death taught me that. There is so much greatness to live for, the blessing I've been given with my family, friendships and the opportunities created for myself. The light and hope does appear, and there's always people willing to help & support other people. I will spend the rest of my days trying to lift the taboo's and negative opinions that surround Suicide & mental illness and I will advocate for and support causes that help people with their turmoil and tough times...Because I wish with all of my soul that there was just one person to help you when you went through yours. I will never hear your voice, see your smile or feel your hugs of support.¬† But I know with every ounce of my being, you're my guiding light and biggest support and ali. I feel that in the decisions I make and the things I think and feel.¬† May your soul be resting eternally in the solace you so deserve Dad, and I'll be sure to catch you on the other side. Until then, I will love you immensely, and miss you even more.¬† All my love for you always ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è¬†

I have never really written on one of these before but tonight everything has just been so overwhelming. 2014 has been one of the hardest years of my life so far. At the beginning of the year I lost my aunty to cancer. It was really hard to deal with because she was my favourite and closest aunty, my dads only living relative and as all signs were showing she was improving greatly but unfortunately randomly took a turn for the worse. The guilt that I was supposed to fly over and see her in January for her 50th birthday has been eating me alive. That chance to see her one last time before she passed that I didn't take because my dad couldn't get time off work and I didn't want to go alone. She was the first person I've lost and that was really hard to deal with, I don't think I've quite dealt with it to date. It made it harder to deal with the loss because on top of losing my aunty, I also lost friendships with four of my closest friends. I'm not very good at being alone but for most of this year, besides my amazing family and two friends that have stuck by me, I've had to deal with the loneliness. It's hard for me to deal with overwhelming feeling of suffocation from sadness, anger and envy because I don't have a hard or bad life. I just can't comprehend why I feel so terrible all the time when my life isn't even bad..I feel so guilty for feeling this terrible. I have a great family, an easy going life, I have my health, a roof over my head, I lead a good life. Tonight everything has really gotten to me and feeling torn between not wanting to die, but also not wanting to live has pushed me to the point I wanted to reach out, the point where I need to reach out. I guess I just want something other than the 'you'll get over it' that I've received all year, the 'I don't really care' response just makes it hard for me to open up to anyone I thought really cared.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

My daughter passed away last October while undergoing her second heart surgery. I have a 7 week old baby who was due on my little girls angelversary, I was induced early - for my own mental wellbeing! But I have been struggling a lot lately, I think maybe it's a combination of baby blues and grief. I have started having horrible nightmares, I've woken from my sleep sweating, screaming, crying, and it's really messing with my head. I have been putting on a fake smile and convincing everyone I'm fine, but I'm really not coping, with the nightmares, my own insecurities and having a new baby.. I'm not scared that I'll do something stupid or irrational.. I'm just worried that my cracks will start to show more and my children and my husband will be the ones who suffer!

Okay, so this is a bit of a yucky post..I'm just feeling so confronted by all of this.my father suffers from depression and anxiety, so does my older brother and so do I.there seems to be more and more ""family history"" of it all popping up as we go on..basically as I was the first one to be diagnosed with mental illness, at that time there was no recorded family history of it anywhere.no one really understood my condition (which I am still struggling with on and off 5 years later), my family doesn't seem to take it seriously.since my diagnosis, my brother contemplated taking his own life (he went so far to write a will) but seems to have recovered now, my father came out with some sort of psychosis and we had to have him involuntarily treated in a hospital earlier this year.. He's living with my grandmother now and was on the path to recovery..until last Tuesday anyway..his brother (my uncle) seemed to pretty much ""spontaneously"" commit suicide..I just don't get it..Last Monday he put my dad and his name down to play bowls for Wednesday, then had some kind of argument with his wife on the Monday night. By Tuesday morning he called in sick from work for the day, called his doctor and made an appointment, but suicided before the appointment.What pushes someone to end it all so spontaneously?the family is devastated and I just can't get it off my mind.. I wasn't really close to my uncle, I guess I'm more upset because the family is so upset.funeral is this Thursday and I'm not sure if I can bring myself to go because the family is all pretty close except me.

I'm 21, my mum had been physically sick with a whole range of illnesses my whole life which I believe led to her also being what I assume was heavily depressed and even for lack of a better word, mental.
also, we never really knew everything that was going on with her because neither her or her doctor would tell us and she was always bitter or sleeping which made it very hard to communicate effectively with her.
i cared for her a lot whilst growing up but I never realized I became relatively desensitized to her suffering because I was around it so much.¬†
I said many many hurtful things to her. I know now that I was taking my stress from her out on her, and she had lived for so long being so sick, my family and I naively got used to an idea that she was always going to live.¬†
Even the week she died we knew it was imminent but we didn't know how to react and she refused any help and had half lost her mind by that stage, so we kind have just went about our week relatively normally knowing she was likely to die any day then.. A thought which we had been having for years but was so much more real at that stage.
¬†it has been 1.5 years since her death and I live with heavy guilt every single day and night. I used to be so positive and now it's like there's no point. My siblings don't feel the same as we all have different experiences of relationships with her and I hate bringing it up to them because I don't want them to feel bad. I've always been the strong one who has been there for others and never asked for help.
¬†i feel like I will never heal because you can't change the past and I can't take back the horrible things I said to her.¬†
No amount of positive words or affirmations or self forgiveness has helped at all.
what can I do? I try talking to her spirit, I've been to psychics, I've written to her in my diary etc. but I feel no change.¬†

Thank you

After reading some posts this morning, I realise I am not alone in my depression. Today has been a bad one, I now see many of you out there, like me, are still struggling with loss years later. I lost my mother to suicide; my partner in a car accident; and recently one of my closest friends. 3 women I was very close with. Guilt. Anger. Questions of why me? Weren't you happy enough taking one special person from me? Why three? Some days I cruise along, smiling, working, not sharing what is happening in my head. It's not cool for us guys to show emotion. Suicidal thoughts? Sometimes. Anniversaries are always so hard. Birthdays. Christmas. I randomly came across this site today. After reading many posts with others describing their struggle to deal with the loss of loved ones, I can now see I am not alone. I feel for all of you struggling with the horrible emotional roller coaster we ride every day. Is there a group which meet together to talk these things through? I have tried the GP. I have tried the shrink. Sometimes I just need someone to listen to me talk and cry out.

With over 40 years of being a fairly happy female and never having really had much to do with grief, I have recently been confronted with the death of someone else's child I don't even know and never met through social media (Facebook).¬† It has broken my heart, and I feel like my life is crumbling around me.¬† I was just a light user of Facebook, but over the last couple of months, friends have shared stories of other parents' Community Facebook pages of their own children recently having died of cancer.¬† They continue their Facebook pages as a way of grieving.
Not knowing much about childhood cancer, I read through their stories and the mothers' constant updates throughout their journey, their photos, even the ones closer to their child dying - so confronting for me.¬†I was coping ok with them, although I was feeling different about life as I knew it, and then I read about¬†a beautiful little 6 yr girl who only died only a few weeks ago from soft tissue cancer, and she reminds me so much of my 5 yr old daughter.¬† I am totally devastated by reading about the pain this little girl endured for over 2 years, and every photo she has a smile on her face, and then¬†her final days in extreme pain, and now her mother's painful grief.¬† I can't stop thinking about¬†the little girl and her mother¬†and feel guilty if I try to return to my family's happy and healthy life.¬† I constantly cry, can't eat, don't want to face life¬†and feel like I will never be the same person I was once before.
I keep going back to her Facebook page as her mother updates most days, and the only good thing about it all is that she died in the arms of her mum and with medical supervision.¬† But, why can't I get over this?¬† Why do I need to revisit her Facebook page?¬† Many friends have said stop reading it, but I feel like her mum might post something beautiful up and I will miss it.¬† I have started to see a psychologist to try and find out what went wrong with me, and she thinks I may be suffering from Vicarious Trauma, which is more related to Health Professionals dealing with constant trauma.¬† There isn't much on the internet about social media and the effects it can have on us.¬† Is it this little girl triggered something in me as she reminds me of my daughter, or is it that I can't cope with all these sad stories on Facebook and the internet, news etc.

my little brother died by suicide a few days before christmas in 2012. it was the hardest thing i have ever experienced. not just my own pain but seeing how crushed my mum and dad werejust left me so heartbroken. we were always fighting as kids and teens but we became good mates later in his life. i would stop by his house on my walk home from work and we would have a few cones and watch tv and just talk about what ever was on tv or in the news.they day i knew he died i was at work. my dad had called me that morning quite irate. he couldnt get in contact with my brother and was getting scared. i assumed he was over reacting as parents do.then i saw a news article on facebook about a man who was my brothers age who had died on my brothers street. it was him, not that i was sure at the time but i can admitt in hindsight im pretty sure i was in denial. i read the article, absorbed it and went back to work. i told myself i was stupid to think it was him. my mum called me a bit later and said she was worried about my dad, he had stopped in at her place on the way down to my brothers and she said he was really agitated. i told mum not to worry and that ben was fine, i even told her about the article i read that day and laughed about the coincidence that a man the same age on the same street died. i cant get over how stupid i was, everyone was telling me something was wrong but i just.. i dont even know what the term is.. blocked it out isnt sufficient. it was just.. it wasnt like i felt like i knew it was him and i was blocking myself from thinking it. i just didnt think it. i had all the facts but that last mental domino just didnt clink downwards. so much so i just went to lunch like normal. i bought red rooster.during my drive my phone rang but i couldnt find it so i let the blutooth answer it. it was my other little brother. i told him he would have to speak up cos i was driving and on speaker. ""ben died, mum said can you come home?"". in that moment everything clicked and i just looked at myself thinking... you ...... it was so obvious. and i had really said all that stupid stuff to my mum and dad... joking about a guy my bros age on his street of like 12 houses dying the day before... my mind just cracked a little that day and i dont think its come right since.¬†¬†

I'm having a difficult time dealing with the upcoming anniversary or my sisters passing. Two years ago I lost my sister to her 5 year battle with breast cancer. She passed away on my birthday. The trauma of the event has been extremely difficult as I find it hard to talk to anyone about the way I feel. My mother makes the situation much more difficult as she has picked up post traumatic issues with paranoia. My feeling have been pushed towards the back and I am constantly made to feel as though my pain is not adequate enough in comparison to 'a mother losing a child'. I struggle with an eating disorder and have been for the past 8 years. I feel as though I an spiralling downwards and I cannot sleep at night due to my depression. I need help with how to cope?

It is now almost 7 weeks since my husband was found neardeath on the floor of the Dementia Specific Unit he was in. He died soon after. The DR thinks it was possibly a massive heart attack. But they don't know for sure. He had been in the Unit for about 2 months & prior to that in a low care facility ( at the same place ) for about 20 months.¬†I had written here before as I was very depressed.¬† My daughter was able to come home from Canada for what turned out to be 5 weeks which was really good for both of us. She has found losing her dad so suddenly very hard. She is now back in Canada & I guess I am now finding that the strength I had to have for her is goin' missin'. I am getting so down, tearful & depressed again¬† ( not suicidally yet thank God ) that I am finding it very hard. Now I know that tears are okay. I know that grief is okay. But the fact that my husband was the only person I had ever been out with, trusted & wasn't scared of is coming back to haunt me I guess. Yes, I was assaulted as a kid & a young person & so was very scared of men. Until I met my husband.He had been my rock for 45 years. I miss him so. I guess I just want to hear that it's okay Ellen. And don't be afraid to ask for help.

Hi all, I just signed up today. I was feeling pretty good until a few days ago. I have my anxious days but there's always a reason for it - uni stress usually. But I read an excerpt of anacquaintances ¬†upcoming book at 1am on a freezing night and it's been my undoing.¬†The book is about drug addiction and the piece I read was about a suicide attempt. (Which she was brought back from). 15 years ago a very good friend of mine took her life. She wasn't fortunate enough to be in a public place.

I am Grieving for the relationship I had with my Brother after he severed all ties with me due to my apparent betrayal of him
I am Grieving for the Father I never knew and will never know now
I am Grieving for my lost innocence and childhood after being continually abused by my step father
I am Grieving for what could have been and the opportunities lost.
When you grieve for someone who has passed over, it is so very final but doesn't hurt any less. What I am finding so difficult is the grief is overwhelming. It feels like someone has died but without the finality of attending a funeral or celebration of their life.

Hiim new to BB and wanted to share my story. I feel like all your threads have spoken to me in some way or another and so hopefully can add something that someone else may draw from.My history starts from being diagnosed with adolesant depression at 11 and being on meds most of my life. I more recently took them up again after an affair and also losing my brother to suicide a few yrs ago and found i couldnt cope. My drinking and drug use got out of control in an attempt to self medicate and then my other brother died from a heart attack due to long term drug abuse. This only pushed my own abuse into overdrive.¬†¬†More recently i have attended drug and alcohol detox and am on my 22nd day of sobriety. Realising its a long hard road to come back from all the anguish i have inflicted upon myself.¬†I am now trialing my 3rd different anti d in the last month and am scared andtired of the self loathing and being in my own company. I havent recovered from the deaths of my siblings nor the daily self punishment for my past/current actions. I feel like im losing grip.¬†beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I lost my eldest son in 1997 to suicide, ¬†now I have just lost my eldest daughter to what I feel is the same. ¬†We have to wait for 6 mths for toxicology results as her autopsy was deemed inconclusive. I dont know how to feel or what to do
¬†After my son died, it raised all my grief from a miscarriage I suffered about 5 years earlier, and this in turn made me all clucky and I desperately wanted to have another baby. I was just 40 and although my marriage was rocky, we had not just 1 but 2 then 3 more kids, with an oppsy at 45......... ¬†¬†¬†At the same time my daughter was also grieving for her brother but had met her partner and they too were having a family, so we alternated having babies for the next few years with both of us having our last 1 week apart in 2003. Soon after my marriage ended.
After some years a rift happened with my daughter and I still don't know why, but she moved to qld with her partner and kids.(my grand-kids) ¬†Until last week I hadn't seen her or the kids for about 7 years, it was her choice to cut us out and try as I might she refused to have any contact with us whatsoever. It has been really hard trying to deal with the loss of those years and the loss of her. ¬†With friends relaying her recent posts on FB the state of mind she was in led me to believe her.
I don't know if what I am feeling is self pity or the right amount of grief, I have my kids I have to look after alone, they have no (or very little) contact with their father, so I have to be there for them as well, and life, work, everything I am responsible for is all just too hard right now. ¬†I just don't want to do anything. Its all too hard.

This week is one year that my beautiful mixed up niece, at age 23, took her own life.¬† I reflect back to all those years of no contact with her or her parents and it is very sad. I feel sad of the loss that we didn't get to see her for quite a long time.
She was a lonely girl who just wanted family, wanted her dad - but she never got him; never got to see him.
I will remember my niece as a fun loving little girl who used to play with my children down at the beach, making sandcastles and playing in the water.

My husbands father was diagnosed with advanced melanoma 10 weeks ago he passed away 2 weeks ago. The day of his funeral my father died suddenly from a heart attack.¬†
I now have a grieving husband, mother, mother-in-law, children, brothers and sister and myself.¬†
As the eldest child I have always ¬†been the one everyone can depend upon. While my sister has been wonderful in helping my mum I still feel that this is largely my responsibility.¬†
My mother-in-law appears to be coping quite well whereas my mother is not my husband seems also to be coping ok but the amount he is drinking tells me otherwise.¬†
I miss my dad terribly. I can't enjoy anything as I keep thinking he should be here doing whatever it is we are doing. I want to cry all day everyday but I do t for fear of upsetting everyone so I leave it till bed time or in the shower.¬†

I just don't know what to do first. I can't be everything to everyone and I can't expect to ""get over"" all of this quickly but I'm just on edge constantly. I can't sleep with everything going through my head and I don't feel I can turn to my husband as he has his own grief to deal with. It's all too much !!!!!!¬†

I watched my grandpa die on September 27 2012 at approximately 11:45am, yet I haven't started grieving. I have completely shut it off. This also means that in turn, I haven't grieved for the loss of my baby on the 7th of April 2014 at approximately 3:30am. My little angel who would have been 1 this year. I haven't grieved for my beautiful little dog Cadbury who was my fur baby that I had to put down or my other fur baby lily who is in a new an loving home.

Hi there,
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† I have been suffering depression and anxiety for about 5 years now and am new to this forum and the beyond blue experience, tonight I thought I would try something different as I am just struggling to cope at the moment. The usual life stresses of work/life/full time study and a long distance relationship with my boyfriend of almost 3years balance with a mental health condition/s I am also struggling with the loss of my best childhood friend that I suddenly lost almost a year ago. I think about her everyday and miss her more than anything. She was my best friend since we were 7 years old, I am almost 23. We never had any problems in our friendship and it was that one person who knew everything about you and you didnt need to explain when you felt sad or upset because she always knew. At the start she was my main support and as selfish as this sounds I now am unsure who I can fully discuss my pain with as my partner just purely does not fully understand mental health issues even though he is the best support and does listen whenever I need it.
People always say it will get easier with time, but does it really? It's already been almost. year and it feels like I lost her yesterday. So much reminds me of her and I know she would want me to life my life to the fullest and be happy, but I feel as though how can I be happy when she is dead? Has anyone been through a similar situation that can offer some of their thoughts or feelings to share please?

I lost my wife in 2011 & I tried to be a carer for her too towards the end (she had diabetes & her organs were failing too), I couldn't stay in the house where we were living so now I'm in a Homeswest unit on my own, gradually after she died I didn't get hardly any visitors & I got lonely & no-one to care for.
i tried my best but for few years now I've been on oxygen 24/7 due to emphysema (30 cigs a day for 30 years. Haven't smoked for 7 years) now I find it hard to get out of bed sometimes & personal hygiene is very poor, I don't care about my appearance much now.

Hi All
¬†Was wondering if anyone else holds on to significant dates for years and relives the hurt? For example this week three years ago I broke up with my ex so I have had a bad week knowing it was the anniversary of our break up and reliving the pain.
¬†Is this a common symptom of depression? How do I put a stop to this and move on?

Hi, I'm a newbie.
In a nutshell, I work full-time, study part-time at uni (on campus 1 day + online) and a bit over 2 weeks ago my mother-in-law died suddenly at 52.
She had been battling cancer for just over 18 months and was recently told to stop treatment. She was given 6 months to live, 6 weeks ago. She went on the holiday she'd been planning for ages, had emergency surgery whilst away and was finally 'well' enough to travel home. We thought she was recovering¬†and back with us until Christmastime. A dislodged blood clot suddenly took her life whilst in hospital. She never made it home. We buried her a week ago.
Prior to this I was already 'down';trapped and overwhelmed with the pressures of juggling work and school, as well as on-going family issues.
I went to the¬†Drs today to get¬†more time off work and she suggested putting me on a Mental Health Plan.¬†This has helped somewhat in the past (I intermittently suffer from anxiety and they were at an all-time high around my wedding 2 years ago), but I just feel like it'll be the same thing: relaxation, breathing techniques, medication discussion (which I am resistant of).
I was reminded of this site when I googled 'I can't stop crying', as that is the kind of day I've had. I have assignments due tomorrow (which I've already had an extension for), but I simply cannot organise my thoughts right now. I feel numb outside, but my heart is physically hurting inside and I feel alone. I feel guilty, weak, stupid and¬†confused at the intensity of my emotions.
What about my husband? He cannot deal with seeing emotions, especially me crying as I am the 'strong type'. He becomes miffed and walks away. His way of dealing with his mother's death is to seclude himself in the shed, whilst 'getting on with it'. He is also planning a week away to see (our) friends, without me. All of this I know he needs to do- and it's his way of grieving, but I¬†can't help but¬†feel unsupported by him- then I feel guilty for those thoughts, guilty for taking our mother's death so hard- afterall, she wasn't¬†MY mum, yet I feel her loss has magnified the 'down' feelings I was already having.
I feel like I cannot turn to friends as grief makes people uncomfortable and although people say 'I'm there for you', it's really a token.
I guess I will see what the psych says. In the meantime I feel sick about how far behind I am at uni- not just with assignments, but school work also. If I cannot do my best I don't want to do it.

Past: I was lucky enough to say goodbye to my aunt over¬†2 days last yrafter she had been diagnosed with C, decided no treatment and was starving herself to ensure an earlier departure. She died 5 weeks later. She was like my mother- my mother, her sister, committed suicide when I was 5.¬†Their father committed suicide 2 yrs later. Her 2 sisters attempted multiple times.Recent: Easter 2014. So my aunt's gone. Acceptable as she was fit 1 day, suffering the next and it was her choice not to have tment. Then my sister was diagnosed with C. Unacceptable. Treatment offered, given. A week after she was diagnosed, my dad died suddenly. Unacceptable - we weren't prepared, he wasn't sick, it was my sister we were focused on.Then, my ex husband, father of my 3 adult kids, was diagnosed with terminal C. What the ?? My kids are falling apart. He was offered a trial drug, to extend perhaps life expectancy to 30mths - 10% chance. 50/50 of 11mths. Our poor kids. How they're hurting!Back to sister. Treatment completed. All was supposed to be good.¬†Except for new C in pelvic bone, liver and kidney!!Back to ex. Experimental¬†tment - 10 weeks¬†pass before they commence because govt approval was not given until the new tax year. Staff at the hospital required professional devt. 10 weeks may not sound like much but a 10cm tumour in the right lung is now 32.5cm. They don't even check nor treat the cancers within the lymph glands.Today:¬†I've done well. So many family members suffering. Everyone it seems.¬†I gave in yesterday. Took me over 24h to get out of bed just to write this. I don't want to give up. I know what it's like for those left behind. I've been there. My mother's suicide has formed the person I've become. But I'm running out of caring and energy to keep going. I feel as if I' ve got nothing left to give nor the desire to take.My daughter rang 2x within past 24 hours, telling me how she had a panic attack, how she had to leave work early because she just can' t cope. Geez, telling her mum this who has had two days off work as the mere thought of it is totally exhausting. That's why I made the apt with dr 2moro. What do I need? Who knows...pills, counselling, whatever...what do I want? An island where I can hide.The worst is that it's only going to get worse, before the healing can start. That could be months or years or who knows. I don't know whether I can last that long! Or can be bothered to actually.That's my story. 8 points.¬†beyondblue‚Äôs clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

So sad about the genius Williams. Am new to this forum. I suffered severe depression last year, got better and stopped my meds in september 2013. Was great until a few weeks ago and noticed early relapse - poor sleep and appetite. Didn't want to go back on meds cos of side effects. I spoke to the only friend who knows what I was going through, and she recommended a book called 'The Apron and Napoleon's Hat', by Dr H.Murray. It's an ebook available on the ibook store and I think it's on Kindle and a few other e-readers. Brilliant!! If you like a bloody funny read about real and gross medical stuff, and more importantly, a book that tells mental illness like it really is and helps to remove the stigma written by someone who knows what he is talking about, read it and tell your friends. We need doctors like this who can genuinely relate. Feel much better now and without meds.

Later this month it will be the 21st anniversary of our son's stillbirth. Part of me would love to celebrate this occasion with a party, I don't think any of the family remember the date or year of our son's birth/death, and that is fine. We never talk about the loss of our children to our families, I have a couple of very close friends I can share some of my feelings with, so at least that is something.
Instead, I will remember our son in my heart and mind on his special day, take myself out to lunch somewhere nice as my husband will be busy that day doing his won stuff, and he doesn't want to know about our children any more than the family do.
I might buy something special to celebrate the occasion, and to keep as a memory of what would have been our son's 21st.
Just writing this, has me in tears. Just wanted to share my rambling thoughts with someone who might care.
¬†
¬†¬† Cheers, from Dools.

im sorry if this is a bit too much..
She was Hit by a car that probably didnt even see her, and left on the side of the road. She was still alive when when i met her at the vet, driven by a passerby, and hung on long enough to recognise me, with a tail wag, as i carried her in to the O.R.
I stayed with her while she was in pain, laying there and holding her. She knew i was there, but i could see her slipping away. Her heart stopped just after my wife arrived. I cant believe she is gone.


As an anx/dep sufferer, i‚Äôm trying to keep strong and process the feelings in my own way, but my wife is taking it very hard.
we had her 11 years, and she was the most beautiful dog. We got her before we had kids of our own, so she was essentially child #1
Any advice for our grief, particularly how i Can help my wife?

Hi, just on 12 months ago I lost my wife who ive been with for 32 years. 
Still till today I am emotionally sensitive, She past in her sleep unexpectedly with me cuddling her when I woke in the morning she was dead in my arms.
Ambulance came and tried to resuscitate her for 30 minutes to no avail.
Because it was a unexpected death a police investigation was required and coronary report done, My wife was born with spina bifada and always had a difficult medical life and we were so close thru so many difficult times. I have very little motivation now always anxious, don't sleep much, I feel so empty inside that I have latch on to a old female freind for support only to be destroying that with overload her with texts doubting her support for me because of my own insecurity demanding constant reassurance of her friendship if I don't hear from her within hours, don't know how to stop this anxiety

Hi everyone,

My mother in law had battled ovarian cancer which also spread to other organs for 2 years. She died in May 3rd. My beautiful mum had fought cancer for over a year and lost her battle 3 weeks after my mother in law on May 23rd.  We lost 3 dear family members in 10 weeks. I didn‚Äôt see my mum on her last Mother‚Äôs Day because of Victoria‚Äôs lockdown rules. I can‚Äôt get that time back...I‚Äôm also an essential worker and have had to work through most of the pandemic. I don‚Äôt feel like I have been able to grieve properly and now my mums birthday is approach on 26th October. I haven‚Äôt even been able to go  to her grave since she was buried on June 1st due to lockdown rules. I am getting really emotional again and feeling angry, frustrated and devastated. I‚Äôve lost my best friend in my mum and my next dearest in my mother in law. It‚Äôs been impossible to deal with. I‚Äôve lost mum. Hubby has lost both his parents. Nothing seems to make me feel happy anymore. We are just trying to get through each day and hopefully things will get easier with time.

I‚Äôm not sure if writing this will help but I‚Äôm not sure what else to do.
My husband passed away from a heart attack in July aged 41. He had no underlying health issues. I barely made it through Father‚Äôs Day & my birthday. Everyone keeps saying how strong I am but I feel like I can barely breath.
The world keeps turning & people are starting to get back into things but my world has stopped. We have a 6 year old who is low functioning Autistic who keeps pointing to pictures of Dad wondering where he is. I talk about him & try to explain as much as I can.
I feel like I‚Äôm letting our child & my husband down. People keep telling me they don‚Äôt know how to help & I just say that being there is all I need. But they don‚Äôt want to be there because that involves seeing me upset, which some can‚Äôt handle.
I feel responsible for his death because I couldn‚Äôt save him & I didn‚Äôt act fast enough.
I‚Äôve had some counselling where they talked about the stages of grief but I feel that wasn‚Äôt enough.
I couldn‚Äôt give my husband a proper send off because of the restrictions & looking back I feel his family who I don‚Äôt get along with took advantage of me but dictating what had to happen at the funeral & by taking some of his ashes. I tried to accomodate everyone but I feel I didn‚Äôt honour my husband enough. 
I don‚Äôt understand why this had to happen & how I‚Äôm supposed to keep putting one foot in front of the other.

Good morning all,
My loving partner died  3 weeks ago and I've been different each day....managing to do all the essentials but at times in a confused ""lost"" sort of way that I hide well.   I conduct conversations with others, some who know, some who don't very easily...chatting and laughing and carrying out the essentials of daily life, paying bills, making appointments, car services, new appliances etc....as if nothing had happened.  
Most mornings though I want to lie in bed for the whole day,never seeing or speaking to anyone.  Driving in the car when a piece of music plays that reminds me of ""us"" the tears come.   I attended a small group meeting of member of a club I belong to  (of course it's all been shut down and in limbo since Corona, so nothing happened to distract me from the loss)....just needed to see familiar faces.  Strangely enough conversation seemed to shut down and become a bit stilted when I arrived..no one mentioned my loss at all.    I was longing for a hug, so I could give way to my pent up emotions, but there were none. 
 No touch,no comfort offered....nothing!  Why was this?   These are great people and I know they care and like me..........but they didn't offer any words of comfort.   Perhaps I was wrong about them being my friends, perhaps they couldn't give a stuff about me after all...what an idiot I am!
The loss is not just""him""...a person.  It's the other things that have also gone.  No one knows me, ""gets""me, or thinks I am as beautiful as he did.   No one will tell me how lovely I look (even when I don't ) any more.  No one calls me  ""darling"". No one has my crazy at times black, sense of humour.   I don't know anyone else who laughs at the same things we did.  It's all those things that have gone too.  No one comes in the door and immediately enfolds me in a hug.
Why didn't my friends comfort me?

Hi Everyone. Two days ago was the birthday of someone I used to be married to. She died in 2006 when our kids were 9 and 11. At the time, she and i had been divorced for about 8 years and we had been sharing custody of our kids. I found out through a grandparent that, for the first time, my daughter went to the grave site. I am so pleased that she is acknowledging her grief. This post, though, is selfishly about me. The eldest of the two has not spoken to me in four years and the youngest, although living with me, puts a very clear wall between me and her grief. I have to tell you that I'm trans. I understand how that must complicate things but, there is no doubt in my mind about the love I have for my children and the depth of my desire to reach out and connect. That connection does not occur. I went down the street this morning to get a coffee and I saw a lovely mum playing with her toddler after probably dropping some of her other kids at school. The beautiful little kid was reaching out to their parent and it reminded me of how much things used to be like that with my kids. I am so sad. I don't know what to do with this sadness. Maybe it's mine forever.

Hi my name is Nicole. I am 35. I am a mother to 3 gorgeous sons. They are 9-8-3. I'm currently struggling with the loss of my dear mother. She was only 56 :(. My mum passed away 11-11-2019. Yet another emotional wave is crashing. Missing my mum so much. Feeling like I am only here because I have to be, not because I want to be. I'm feeling defeated. I'm feeling done.
I struggle to get out of bed. Because sleep is the only time I feel nothing. Wish I could just sleep the rest of my life away. Feeling like I am on auto polite. On the verge of tears. Constant pain in chest. Knowing a part of me is missing. I know we aren't meant to live forever. But I didn't expect my mum to be gone so soon. This is one of the worst pains. I just want my mum back :( 
I miss the old me. I have no motivation. Trying to work out how to survive the new normal. How do you live without the one who gave you life?... This pain is seriously like no other.

Hello, 
First time posting....
Whilst getting ready this morning, in general conversation, my daughter randomly dropped a bombshell that her teacher would be away today as they are going to a funeral of the father of a child in class...  I have since messaged the teacher to find out what the class know and or have been told.  I know the father, not well,  but somewhat, as their child is a very good friend of mine so have seen him at drop off / pick up, play dates, birthdays etc.  I am shocked as the child is similar age to mine, who is now experiencing this tragedy.  I tried talking to my daughter this morning about what she knew about the situation and her awareness of death but not sure of her actual understanding, hence why I messaged the teacher for some clarification...  Apologies for the confusing, long post...  My question is how do you talk to a primary school child who's good friend's dad has committed suicide and how to care for their friend?

i'm quite young, in anyone's terms. i had three older brothers, and an older sister as well. all of my brothers enlisted in the army, and were deployed when I was 10. i just remember my teacher telling me that there'd been an emergency and I had to go to my sister's school. we were taken to a quiet office and told that our two eldest brothers (who were twins) had died serving overseas. it sounds terrible, but I don't think I really felt it. i didn't really care until years later when I realised that I wasn't going to get them back, ever. just 2 years after that, our last brother died. he'd been shot, and died in intensive care later the same day. i felt his loss a lot more, and I don't know if it was because I was older, or if it was because I was closer with him than our other brothers. but I've had this sort of empty feeling in me whenever I see people with their siblings, or my friends talk about their brothers. I've never told anyone outside my family about it. it's too painful. once one of my friends told me I should get a brother, and I burst out crying at school. i keep getting flashbacks of all of us together, doing piggyback rides or stealing icecream or go kart rides. i just don't feel like anyone would understand. losing one sibling, maybe, but three? my sister has seemed to be fine, as bad as it sounds. she's never cried about it to my knowledge, and doesn't seem to be affected when anyone talks about their brothers or the army or war. i can barely hold in tears when that happens. we learnt about world war II in history and all I could think about was the hundreds of thousands of families who would never get their son or father or brother back. my four male cousins, who I am very close with, are all active members of different armies and I'm so terrified that I'm going to get a phone call one day telling me that they've passed away. I'm so scared I've begged them to quit the army but they don't seem to share the same fear. they were all devastated when my brothers died but they don't seem to ever consider that it could happen to them, and what it would do to our family. it's so painful writing this out, it just feels like there's a big hole in my chest that gets heavier every day. i miss them all endlessly.

I'm here home alone and my sister called to say Dad had collapsed in the city and the ambulance people were assisting him.
I phoned some friends and asked if they could come and be with me, they were busy.
My husband is on his way home, it will take him a couple of hours.
The police called into my sister's home and told her Dad has died.
I phoned my Minister and he said ""That will happen. People die."" I told him I had to go.
I don't know why I am sharing this here. I don't know what else to do right now.
I don't even know if this post is suitable for the forums.

Hi,
I lost my dad to suicide yesterday morning. My mum found him in our backyard. It was unexpected and i woke up to my mums call, her voice was distraught and she was yelling ""come home!"". Since yesterday, I've felt like I'm in limbo. I go through phases of having clear thoughts, (like listing out what needs to be done, making sure i look after myself so i can look after my mum, consciously acknowledging my own grieving process) and periods of just staring at nothing, with nothing and everything thoughts swimming in my head.
It's only been just over a day since its happened so I think I'm still in somewhat shock, I let myself cry when i need to, and i try to verbalise my thoughts and feelings with mum, and she does the same with me. I'm concerned for my mum as she is the one who found the body, had to call the ambos, and had to¬†perform cpr. I think she's still in shock too because when i ask her if she's having flashbacks or is that memory sort of haunting her, she says not really.
I feel odd, almost like i want to spiral into the emotional rollercoaster that i know is coming, just so i can get it over and done with? But i also know I can't force these things. So i'm just left with these conflicting thoughts in my head.
I'm not sure what I'm looking for by typing here, not so much condolences, more so people who have experienced something similar, and what their journey was? Maybe a story I can somewhat relate to or just some tips of how people got through their losses that are similar to mine.

Thanks

Im 28 years old and my mum died VERY EXEXPECTEDLY with a massive stroke/brain annerysm in November 2017. It was quite confronting as my brother, dad and I sat with her for days in ICU on life support completly unconcious  where we told we had to turn it off. It all went so fast and we just had to deal with what happend. Its been a year and a half but Im feeling like the grief is becoming a little harder. People who have/are experiencing greif. How long does it last? I know there is no right or wrong answer and I know everyone is different. But im just so mentally tired and drained from being so sad and not letting go. My boyfriend has been so supportive, I think its so unfair for him that I am so emotional all the time.

My mum died on the 23rd May this year. I was caring for her. To cope with not having her around I am imaging she is but I just can‚Äôt see her. I avoid all places and people so I can keep it real. My anxiety is up through the roof. Mum would have been 85 in October and we would have had a big family party for her. I‚Äôve withdrawn from some siblings. I‚Äôve organised mum and dads plague for their grave (dad died May  2009) one of my siblings doesn‚Äôt like it at all and has a different interpretation of the design. I was told it didn‚Äôt give mum the respect she deserved and that she regretted marrying my dad. This is heartbreaking. They weren‚Äôt the perfect couple and they did have some whooping arguments we all witnessed as children but there were good time‚Äôs as well.

Hey,
im new to this forum community. August 28 11:20pm my world changed forever. My Nan, my best friend passed away peacefully with pop and me by her side. She was 90 years old and was very sick near the end, she lasted 5 days of being unconscious until she passed away, those five days were tough sitting by her side watched her suffer and then watched her peacefully pass away which that moment was so special I will be forever grateful for. Nan and I had a very special bond. One like no other. We became even more close when Nan lost her daughter in January of 2016 after a short illness with brain cancer. My Aunty dying really hit nan hard which would to anyone.
anyway, this past week without nan have been extremely hard, I have cried, got angry and just been miserable and hurting. I‚Äôm after some advice that has helped in the early stages of grieving.
 
thanks

Hi there

I lost my dog a week ago to sudden illness. He was only 3.5yrs old and he was my everything.  He was my first dog that I rescued from a shelter.  He provided me with such support and gave me a purpose to keep going. Last year I started IVF and currently 2 rounds have failed and he was there to let me know I was loved and needed.  

Having him suddenly take ill and then dying has shocked me to my core. I can't be in my home alone as he is everywhere I look. I feel so guilty that I couldn't save him and miss him so terribly that I feel like the grief will swallow me whole.  I don't know how to function or move forward knowing he is not by my side. My boy was everything and now I have lost purpose.

I'm grieving the death of a man I loved.  He loved me too.  The difficulty is that I met him while I was volunteering at an aged care facility.  Of course there are rules about not allowing oneself to get too close or too involved with residents.  Sometimes, despite the rules, these things happen.  We formed a very special bond over a 5 month period.  Unfortunately, he told his family about his relationship with me and they, understandably, were concerned.  They brought the situation up with management, and of course I was reprimanded for my behavior.  They didn't know the extent of our relationship.........nobody did except for the two of us.  It wasn't something that we could share with others.  No matter how hard we tried, we would never have been able to make people understand.  The age difference for one, not to mention the fact that he had multiple medical issues etc.  
I was forced to leave and told not to contact him or his family.  I didn't get to say goodbye.  I don't know if anyone explained to him why I had to leave.  I've been so depressed and worried about him.  He passed away three days ago.  The grief I feel is making me sick.  I don't think it's just the grief.  It's all the things that happened, the way they happened and the fact that I have no one to help me work through my grief, because no one really knows how much we meant to each other.  My family know that I formed a friendship with him, but that's as far as it goes.  They feel for me in that respect, but must be wondering why my grief is so debilitating.  I have to cry in private, I have no one to talk to about the true relationship I had with him.
The last time I saw him was Boxing Day 2019.  Even though he was in his late eighties, very unwell and is no doubt in a much better place now, I still can't stop crying.  I can't seem to accept that he's gone.  My grief is making me sick.  Everything seems 'unreal'. Because I'm not a family member, I don't have anywhere to express my grief and sorrow at his passing.  I can't attend his funeral.  I just feel lost and helpless.

I don‚Äôt even know how to start... I‚Äôll just ramble on I‚Äôm sorry
so these days or these two weeks you could say(?) I‚Äôve been having dreams or nightmares about the same person that passed away in 2017. She was really special to me and basically took care of me my whole life and taught me so many things on life and all those stuff. They end the same way and whenever i wake up from my dreams my eyes would hurt and there‚Äôs be tears Falling down my face. I want those kind of dreams to stop because it‚Äôs been affecting me and all. I can clearly remember the dream Like its real life and i really hate it. The thing is I didn‚Äôt get to say goodbye to her so maybe that‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm having these dreams? But why after 2 years?
the dreams would go like this:(this is all like a vivid dream)
I‚Äôm with her and other people and it‚Äôs a normal day and the place I‚Äôm at is really beautiful for some reason i actually don‚Äôt know the place I‚Äôm not sure if it even exists in real life..anyways it‚Äôs like a normal day she‚Äôd be sitting in her chair watching tv and I‚Äôd be using my phone and going to her or sitting beside her annoying her and telling her about everything and anything that has been happening to me in real life and she‚Äôd give advice and stuff and the next thing I know, I‚Äôm crying telling her to not go and like trying to hold on to her and while begging her to stay and she‚Äôd just smile and the next thing i know it goes blank and other people are trying to calm me down but i was screaming that it‚Äôs not fair and that i never got to say goodbye to her but others did i never got to say I‚Äôm sorry and i hope you‚Äôre proud of me or i love you one last time my chest starts hurting and it goes blank 
That‚Äôs when I wake up. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I really want to talk to her just for an hour even in my dreams i never got the chance to tell her that I‚Äôve done this and that and I‚Äôve never got the chance to make her proud. All the things I‚Äôve achieved or done seems pointless to me now

Hi, I lost my beautiful Mother 2 months ago to Cancer.. she was only 56 and I 26. 
I have been in the grips of an emotional black hole since. I am heartbroken, lost and trying to find meaning in life to continue. The hardest thing is, the loss of connection and inability to connect to others who have been fortunate enough to not experience this pain. I am hoping to find others who have lost their mothers. 
I hope once we have found each other we can offer support, share stories and get through this together!

This afternoon I received a phone call from my mum that my oldest cousin on my dad's side had taken her own life in the past 24 hours. This is the first suicide in my family and I don't know how to deal with it. All my other relatives who have passed away in my life time has been old age, and or cancer - so it was sad but sadly expected. I'm not sure how to deal with this...she had shown no signs from what I viewed (mainly online as we live in different states) I was told she even went to her doctor to talk about her developing depression, in the past few days. All I am feeling right now is numb and feeling guilty, guilty because I don't know if I could have done something, or sensed that something was going on, i hope you know what I mean. I have seen her family online and I have no idea of what to say to them. What could I say to make it better? I just wish I could go and comfort them but I am in Adelaide and they are in Melbourne. I just need some advice of how to deal with this.

Hi everyone. I don‚Äôt usually post online and am new here. I lost my beloved Dad two weeks ago and am struggling. He had dementia and was deteriorating mentally and physically but everyone thought he had more time. They were wrong. I didn‚Äôt get the chance to sat a proper goodbye he was unconscious by the time I got to see him. It just hurts so much to know I‚Äôm never going to see him again. I feel so lost and raw. I can‚Äôt concentrate or focus and just want to hide away all the time. I would give absolutely anything for just a few minutes with him.

My dad died last week without any warning. I spoke with him an hour beforehand & he was absolutely fine. Mum said one minute he was talking to her & the next minute he had collapsed & couldn‚Äôt be resuscitated. 
I don‚Äôt want to believe it‚Äôs real. I‚Äôm angry sick people live for ages and healthy people like dad can just drop dead. 
I‚Äôm worried about mum who is completely broken and now questions the point of her own life now dads not here. 
He was a very respected person but we couldn‚Äôt hold the funeral he deserved as only 10 people were allowed and we couldn‚Äôt hold a wake because of covid. 
Its not fair. He was here one minute and gone the next.
We are unable to attend any grief support groups because of covid. I don‚Äôt know if they would help but it could be a start.
Its a roller coaster of sadness, disbelief & anger. If he could die without any warning whatsoever that means I could too. What‚Äôs the point of living.

Hi every one, my first post I will try to keep it short. I miss my grandson so much . It‚Äôs killing me inside.i was at his very short birth. My daughter rang me 3am when William was 24 days old. She was so tired, had a sick 3yo and hubby with the flue. William who we called Wilby had a cough. So I got over there , sent her to bed for some sleep and looked after Wilby, in the 4 hours I cuddled that sweet bub he wouldn‚Äôt drink his bottle. Well his little family woke and I told my daughter to give him some breast milk as he wouldn‚Äôt drink any bottle, then I said he was lethargic let‚Äôs take him to hospital he is dehydrated. As I put Wilby in the car he gave a little grin. 25 minutes later we get to hospital, my daughter gets his bag and it‚Äôs my job to put my grandsons in and out of the cars. As I got him out I thought he was asleep, as I wrapped him in his blankie he made a terrible sound, as I looked at him, he was gone , I screamed to my daughter as I have her Wilby and yelled to her¬† run. After what seen like hours they got a pulse. Well really 3 hospitals and 4 days later he took his last breath. That dear sweet Wilby was dying in my arms and I didn‚Äôt know. What kind of granma am I? I am not coping and still see his mum‚Äôs pain in her eyes and the heart break as she held him for hours . Then to drive 2 hours home without him in his car seat. I breath him, think about him Every moment of the day and really want to be with him . I just can‚Äôt get over the thought if I‚Äôd only woke her and said let‚Äôs go now , Wilby would still be here. Sad granma

So, on my birthday at the beginning of the year. i lost my poppy, now he was a very special man. he meant the absolute world to myself and my family. and his death was so so sudden. i felt so numb. then a few days later, i saw a post on Facebook that a girl i used to dance with had passed away, and i immediately text the sister of the girl and say ' i am so sorry, she was so beautiful. i will see you in a few days,' Because i knew her and her family for most of my childhood. god she was only young, i felt so numb inside.
then the hard part was who funeral do i go to, and i sat down and i looked up and i knew my poppy would understand why i wouldn't be saying goodbye to him with everyone else. 
when i got there, i found the sister and we cried in each others arms. for so long. they were my family too. 
and on top of all this, i was in a very toxic relationship. he just wasn't helping me. and i couldn't have the loss of these two amazing people in my life, piled on top of my toxic relationship. so during all of that, i was also going through quite a tough breakup.
its been 7 months, and i thought i was getting better and better. but its all coming back. its just all in my head.

Firstly I hope everyone who still have their mum really appreciated them not just for today but every day.
Sadly I lost mine on 31st July 2015.  I have good memories and a visit to the cemetery gave me some sense of peace. I had the opportunity to be with her when she left. Sadly during this pandemic not all people got that opportunity. For
Those people I feel so sad for you and hope you can think of them in better days. To all mums please have a safe and healthy day. A friend of mine said to me that every day is mothers day as they never take a day off. My mum said make
Every day count as no use feeling regret once they have gone. This I managed to do before she left so this makes my 
loss a lot easier.  Isolation may be hard but a loss is harder. Appreciate what you have now for this period will not last
Forever.

Hello,
It is important that you learn to be resilient after a loss of a loved one. Sometimes, we just need to chill out by ourselves for a short time or spend time with happy people. Imagine a ball bouncing back up to you. Life should be just like that when a setback happens. Bounce back from negative events quickly.

Hello everyone. Two weeks ago, my partner of 9 years died. He had been ill since last year and his death was not peaceful. Shortly before he died, I discovered some unpleasant things about my partner. I wonder if I really knew him and if he really loved me. To make matters worse, there are several toxic adult children from his previous marriage who are making life difficult for me. I find it difficult to grieve properly for the loss of my partner because I'm very confused about the person he really was. Friends advise me to try to remember the happy times in our relationship but I feel betrayed and let down by my partner. Any advice?

New to this forum and not really sure where to start. Guess I'll start by sharing my story. Going back 9 weeks now my partner and love of my life took her own life. I won't go into details as it's still very raw and hard to talk about. There isn't a day that goes by where I'm not over come with grief. Tears are shed and I become sick with how my h I miss her. As most that have suffered something similar would know, I still struggle with guilt for not being able to help or be there. I all ways feel alone even when I'm around friends and family. I'm lucky that I have a good support group around me but they have never had to go through something like this, so they help me best they know how, which is great. But even then I can't talk about what I'm feeling or thinking as it's all new to them. So I guess that's why I decided to reach out on this forum. I know there is no time that will go past that will make it easier, but hopefully it does get some what more bearable to live with. Cause at the moment I'm not sure it ever will. Well thanks for reading.

Hi everyone, 
When I was 13, my Mum had a severe stroke that left her paralysed on one side of her body and with some memory loss.
My Mum was basically my Dad's carer at the time, as he had a genetic illness and his mental health declined over the years. 
They both moved into nursing homes, as they needed extra care and considering I was young I couldn't look after them myself.
Late 2018, my mum's health declined and in March 2019 she passed away. 
Fast forward 14 months later (last month) my Dad unfortunately passed away.
My parent's Doctors both put them into palliative care. My mum was in it for 6 months, whereas my Dad passed away within 5 days. 
Mum lost so much weight and looked unrecognisable in the end and Dad was a shock as he went for a checkup for something else and the doctor said he had until the end of the week to live, due to fluid in his lungs. 
They seemed to be in a lot of pain in their final week. 
I'm 26 now and I've struggled a lot with depression and anxiety over the years, but I can't shake the regret, anger and sadness I have with myself. I feel like I was in a state of denial for so long about their declining health, that I didn't see them as much as I should've. I have so much regret about not spending their last day with them and not being there in their final hours. I really hope they knew how much I loved and appreciated them.
I'm an only child aswell and even though I know I have a lot of supportive family members and friends, I still feel so alone during this time.
I'm the only one in my friendship group that has lost a parent, let alone both. 

I will be returning to counselling at some point but can't physically speak about this face to face without breaking down. I find it hard to talk to my friends about this, because they haven't experienced something similar and I feel they have issues of their own and I don't want to burden them.
I'm also stressed about their cemetery plaque, as I don't know what to write or do for it.
Their funerals both seem like a blur to me, especially my Dad's which was only 3 weeks ago.
I just wanted to know if there was a way to help manage feelings of regret and grief?
If anyone reading this has attended a grief support group in person, was it helpful connecting with others compared to just a counsellor?
Thank you!

I don't like to label myself, but these are the keywords of my story - lost mum, an only child, Chinese, living remotely. I am seeking help.
I have been
chatting with a Psychologist since April this year, however, I still don't know how to cope with my mum's death. She was my biggest supporter, she was always there, she was my bestie... My stomach is still in knots. I cannot even unfold any of her clothing. My tears are flowing any time I remember her face and the last picture haunting me in my mind was her body was full of tubes and her closed eyes.
Exactly 4 months ago today, I lost my mum so suddenly. I was on my lunch break at work and was told by my auntie, my mum was in ICU and after 4 hours, she is gone, heart-attack. She was only 59!  I was even talking to her on messenger the day before, everything was fine, no last words, she was gone. I was in Australia, she was in China. My husband and I flew immediately back to China the next day and attended the funeral, only days before China and Australia locked down both countries.
Because of the Covid-19 situation, after 14 days of quarantine in China, many tasks were still outstanding. I have not yet chosen the tomb. Things are undone, unfinished. According to Chinese culture, I haven't completed/performed my duty to my mum yet. Her ashes were stored in a small box in a storeroom at a funeral house.
I am the only carer of my mum (my Dad and Mum separated), I feel really guilty in the whole situation; if I don't live in Australia, if I can spend more time with her, these things may not happen.
My husband, Australian and Chinese families, friends, work, boss, colleagues, have been providing great support to me. Coming back to Australia, we have been quarantined for another 14 days self -isolation and since then I have been working from home. Due to a career advancement decision, my husband and I moved to a remote regional country town, there are no family members and close friends here. I miss the face-to-face chat.
I don't know how to deal with the whole situation, my best mentor - she left me, I don't know how to deal with life without her.
Help me, as an extroverted person I think talking about this on an online forum might help.

My cat liked to spend a lot of time playing outdoors. My biggest nightmare was always her getting lost out there, or getting hurt. It was the source of a lot of anxiety for me and there were multiple times where I cried thinking she was lost if she took too long to come back inside. On top of that I tend to catastrophize and always had this impending fear of the pain it would cause me to lose her because she meant so much to me.

My cat got hit by a car and passed away yesterday. Amongst all the pain I feel a weird sense of relief about not having to feel continuously anxious about her anymore. 

I can‚Äôt help but feel selfish or heartless for feeling relieved. I really hope I gave her the best life possible and would do anything to hold her again.

Hi everyone, one of my closest friend's immediate family member passed away several hours ago. He was a critical stage corona patient and suffered greatly. My friend, or anyone else, cannot attend the funeral because of the quarantine. I want to be a good friend and support her, but I don't know what to say. I am genuinely out of resources here. I would be very grateful if you guys can share some pointers on bedside manner or whatever. Thanks in advance.

I lost my mum three days ago.
She was my best friend and my only parent, and I loved her very much. She got her diagnosis three weeks before she passed away and was in hospital that whole time. It took me about two weeks to come to terms with her diagnosis and I did occasionally feel heavy and a bit sad (but nowhere near as sad as I thought I should‚Äôve felt) but after a certain point I made peace with the fact that she was going to die, and I feel like that peace came way too quickly and easily.
On the day she passed away I felt an initial shock, and I cried a bit while getting dressed and taking a taxi to the hospital, but then I felt fine. I was apprehensive to see her corpse, but when I did, I was shocked at how okay I was. It felt normal. What I‚Äôm feeling is not an emotional numbness but a normalcy. Not having her around the house even feels normal, which is bizarre.
It‚Äôs been three days and I‚Äôm not thinking about her a lot. When I do I feel fine. I can even think about her corpse and feel fine. I know people say this can happen with grief, but this just feels different. It‚Äôs not a numbness, I‚Äôm feeling other emotions, I can even have fun when I do things like play games. I‚Äôm not dissociated at all either.
It might be worth noting that I‚Äôve never lost someone before, I‚Äôve had a lot of cats die though, cats that I loved very much, and I also never grieved them.
So yeah. Any advice? Does anyone relate? I feel terrible about this, like I‚Äôm disrespecting her.

Hi, this is my first time ever posting on a forum but I just needed to get my emotions out. My dad passed away very suddenly a month ago and I am really struggling to make it through every day without breaking down. I have moved back in with my mum (I'm only 19 by the way) as I was living away for university so I have her, my brother, and my boyfriend as support but I am so upset. As soon as I am alone I just start crying and I am terrified to fall asleep because anytime I try I just can't stop the emotions coming out. My parents were divorced so I have lived with my mum since I was 11 and so I didn't see my dad as much as I should've because we all think they'll be there forever so I was always too busy to see him, but when I did see him it was great and he always gave me the best hugs. I just have no idea how I'm supposed to keep going on, I was in the middle of final exams for uni and I have deferred for a few more weeks but I'm struggling to study and that is stressing me out as well so I am just completely lost at the moment and I have an appointment with a psysohologsist in the next couple of weeks but I'm struggling every day to get by. we cleaned out his room a few days ago and it was so hard. I just keep waiting for him to walk in a room and tell me it'll be okay and give me a big hug and even though I have the support I feel so alone and like no one can understand what I'm going through. and I just feel so angry at the world because he's supposed to be there to watch me grow up and graduate uni and have a family and help me move into my first house and lecture about not cleaning my car enough and he's not going to be there and I don't know how I'm ever going to be okay with that. He was struggling with health recently which is what he died from but it was still so sudden because it only started a few months ago, because of this he had to leave work and one of the last messages he sent to me was how at least now he wasn't working he would be around to watch me graduate. He was so scared and I kept telling him it would be okay because I thought it would be because he was only 54 and I thought that it would be okay, and I really can't stop thinking about if he knew he was dying and if he in pain because that makes me so sad.

Day in and day out. He's here, sedated, with a ventilator, screens, tubes beeps. Uncertainty: will he ever come back home? 3 days before my husband went to hospital, he was diagnosed with autism. 28 years of a difficult life with him, with some good times in between. Was it dementia? or was it depression? what was it?. Now, we had a few years ahead of us with some counselling, I'd be able to endure his lack of understanding, his aloofness . We'd get closer  and enjoy the last years of our life. But no, it was not meant to be, I had to call an ambulance, we are apart.Everytime the phone rings, I think 'This is the hospital, he's gone'. Living like this is absolute hell, I can't bear it.

Hi everyone, 
I just want to share my story of the people I had loss. When I was 9 years old I lost my dad  to an illness, and since I was younger at that time, I did not know the full extent of grief and loss. Now and then I would be sad and miss him so much. But looking back at it now, I can't imagine what my mum was going through. Especially since we  just arrived to Australia as refugees. Not only did my mum lose a husband but she had to adapt to a new country, learn a new language and look after her 3 kids as a widow. 
I am so grateful for everything she's done for us and how strong she is for looking after us as a widow with no husband or other immediate family members in Australia. Since mental health is a taboo topic in my cultural, I never really had a conversation with her on how she coped.
Nonetheless, fast forward to 2019 my mum found a new partner, and told us she was pregnant. Since my mum was a bit older now, there is a high risk of carrying a baby. I was especially  mad when I found out because I thought instead of retiring soon, she will have to restart with her life and start motherhood all over again. I know I was extremely selfish for saying that and feeling that way, which I REGRET the most till this day.  Also, I did not have a good relationship with my step-dad (to me it felt like he was replacing my dad) which made the situation worst. 
Slowly, I started accepting the reality of my mum's pregnancy and having a sister, I was excited and planned out a life for her. However, suddenly my mum complained of stomach pain and i took her to the hospital. Unfortunately, during the ultrasound, the doctor could not find my sister's heart beat. I just started crying and felt so guilty for everything. What's worst is that my mum felt she had to act strong in front of me and till this day, she rarely shows her emotions to us. I honestly can't not imagine what she is going through right now. I feel so much pain and sadness for my mother. Everyday I would think of her and I would feel guilty and full of regrets.
 Even though she's not with us, she will be in our hearts and we miss her everyday. I just hope my mum  and step-dad is coping well. 
Thanks for reading

Hi, my name's Layne, last year I lost my dad a week before his birthday, he passed from pneumonia. He pretty much raised me, i was and still not close with my mum, I currently live in Sydney whilst he lived in New Zealand, so going home has been hard, I've only been home twice since he left, a day before his funeral and 1 year after, I feel like I'm the only one who's grieving, my family act as if his passing meant nothing, I tear up every time i see a photo of him, I avoid talking about him because i get emotional, i can't talk my family about how I feel because I feel like noone is listening, Is there anything I can do to get over it?

I‚Äôm not sure where to start and it might seem trivial to some- but I lost my best mate almost 3 years ago. He was my Dad and my heart ached today just like it did on the day I lost him. I‚Äôm trying to make sense of it. Why now? I honestly think I would like to join him

Hello to anyone reading this,

I am looking for support, as my father committed suicide this morning, and I am having abit of trouble coping. 

My father was a good man, with no outward signs of suicidal thoughts. 

He is loved so much, by so many people. He has 10 times the amount of friends that I do. He always tried to make others happy, and was a great friend.

Everyone in mine and my fathers family and friend circle are shocked, and absolutely devastated.

Last week, my partner gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. They are currently overseas caught up in this virus bullshit, and my father never got to see him.

I am just so hurt, upset, angry, confused and lost. 

If anyone can reccomend a place to start to help, that would be great. 


Fighting back tears,

I‚Äôd just turned 18 three months before I took the test that showed up with two pink lines. Looking back now, I wish I‚Äôd made more of an effort to keep it safe, it was the only thing connecting me to my baby and it was lost when we moved houses.
I wasn‚Äôt in a relationship. I was barely an adult. But I knew for sure when my doctor asked me what I wanted to do, I couldn‚Äôt go through with an abortion.
But two weeks later I got the news most pregnant people don‚Äôt want to hear. I was miscarrying. 
I never heard their heartbeat. I never got to see them. They were just gone. Two amazing weeks thinking I was going to be a mummy, taken from me just like that.
I‚Äôm 24 now and I still really struggle with the loss of my baby. Thoughts keep running through my mind.. what could I have done differently? Is it my fault I lost my baby? Will I ever have a family? 
It feels like I‚Äôll never get another chance at having a family and my heart hurts. My heart hurts thinking about the child I could‚Äôve had. How they would‚Äôve started school this year. I feel like I‚Äôve missed so much because my chance at being a mother was taken from me and sometimes I just really can‚Äôt cope with that.

My beautiful daughter took her own life on Feb 11. I am struggling with overwhelming grief and having thoughts of not wanting to go on.
We had no idea she was in such a dark place and keep asking why.

I come under the heading of ""dutiful child"". Visited in Nursing home at least weekly. Prior to that rang and visited. I did the right thing for people who didnt do right by me.I sat by their bed day and night in those last few days. I held their hand as they passed. Such a ""good"" child.
Am I grieving what should have been, what could have been. Some siblings arent that upset. Some are more nostalgic about the few decent things from our childhood. One cut them both off completely.
Why do I cry? why do I grieve?

Hi all, new here but never posted, actually signed up about two months ago because i was feeling down and not long after my mum suddenly passed away. Currently having counselling but craving to talk to people and share stories and connect. Helping helps, please tell me your story if you have lost your mum (she was 69). I'm coping, just. xx  Best wishes to anyone going through loss, grief anxiety (i've started calling panic attacks ""stress moments""), .I hate the words panic and attack!

I've just recently lost my Nan suddenly. During this Covid-19 pandemic. Attempting to be there for the funeral was proven to be a challenge but not impossible. I was still able to fly interstate without needing to quarantine. I was still able to comfort those who could be there. I was also there to make some hard decisions and funeral arrangements. My Nan was like the next figure in life to what people call one a ""Mum""... Long story short. I helped care for my Nan before she went into a home from all my teenage years. I'm having trouble coping with her being just ""Gone"" I felt like i didn't have time to grieve or be sad or to even laugh or cry. You become busy deciding the colour of her coffin and what photo to choose best and what flowers she would of loved by the time the day comes around your not ready to say goodbye yet. Due to the pandemic outbreak and states having their own lockdown and regulations i had to leave 1 day earlier before the service. I wasn't able to be there till the end to even lay her down. Instead i had to watch from a screen and feel at a distance. I'm vividly struggling sometimes to sleep. I can still feel her cold holds against mine and although i still got to see her and kiss her and share upon the memories we had together. I wasn't ready to say goodbye or let go. Now shes been floating around me in thoughts, in my dreams and i just feel like there's a lump in my throat that's hard to explain the presence of. How does one find ways to accept this passing and move forward in life?

My amazing Mum was in good health, no pain, paying $5000/month for [we thought] top-notch care and to be kept safe. Well, management dropped the ball, kicked it across town to another agency, who also dropped the ball, passed the buck - not telling us anything or bullshitting us. For those $$ you'd think you'd get the best care and decent food. Not so. I honestly think she would've been safer next door in the hotel for $125/night max and still have $50/day for food; towels and bedding changed daily, bathroom cleaned daily. Instead, Mum was getting meals brought up on a tray and left at her door. The management kept slipping long and convoluted letters under the doors of ALL residents many - like Mum - with impaired vision, memory loss and cognitive difficulties. The morning they found Mum in a bad state - paramedics were called and they didn't take the envelope with all her instructions, phone numbers, etc. One person said they weren't allowed to touch or take anything; another said they hadn't heard of that rule. Then they said probable UTI (probable more BS), possible RSV and possible Covid19. She had a cough and no fever and they put her on oxygen and ran tests including Covid19 which, they say, came back negative. They then moved her either to or from the acute ward to Covid19 ward and she was now a bit more alert, not eating much, still on oxygen but with ""gurgly"" lungs. But, remember, they said negative to Covid19 yet they were going to do more tests. Didn't happen. Next thing, she is ""gone"". They say some kind of pneumonia likely one of the manifestations of Covid19. Mum didn't deserve to die like that. Criminal negligence! More lies about cause of death so they don't panic or scare the other residents, presumably, and protect their precious reputation. If this is a first-rate aged care home (in Canada) I shudder to think what the budget places are like. And - the icing on the bullshit mound - today I get an update email from the GM of the home (who knew Mum had died as she phoned my sister today to offer her condolences) - one of the ""Happy Families/Aren't We All Wonderful"" updates about how there are NO problems, they have lots to CELEBRATE and happy-everyone photos and stories but no mention of my mother. Nothing. Not even a lie that she had died of pneumonia not Covid19 related. This is why I don't trust anyone and I am devastated. Like in all wars, truth is the first casualty. Insensitivity is the next.

I am 18 years old and I was 12 when my dad committed suicide. I am an older sibling to my younger brother who is now 16, and I feel that over the past 5 years I have been the older sister and supported him, along with my mum. By doing this I have forgotten about myself and I feel like the grief is only just hitting me now. I hate talking about my dad and the way he died and I hate seeing therapists. I am afraid to cry in front of my family or even talk to my family about how I feel because we don‚Äôt really talk about it anymore. My mums boyfriend and his son have just moved in which makes bringing up the topic even worse as they are always around. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

Hi. Ive come on here as my back story is I lost my soul mate , the love of my life in a work place truck accident March2018 on his birthday , 8 months prior my bff girlfriend of 35 years passed away and  Feb 10th this year my mum passed away . The three closest people to me who loved me unconditionally . I have 3 daughters but the relationship is not like that of with my mum. . They think support is inviting to a grand child's soccer game . . I lost my fathers at 9 years old, identical to Daniel trucks and logs . Daniels death is still going with lawyers , Work safe etc . I am going to lawyer today to sign to be administrator of Mums will. For over 30 years my brother was Executor, he's a multi millionaire so when Mum passed he would‚Äôve just brought his people in and had them clean her unit out etc . Nope 3 weeks before she passed he threw the paper work at me and washed his hands . I was the  last person to be dealing with this . It just gets worse . So Im going to cut to now . I thought there had to be  a group of some sort as when you live on own your beyond isolated . I do take meds for depression and anxiety , its genetic so with the death and trauma , it was a no brainer . Everyone in family on medication . As that first loss at 9 years didn't stop there . The death has gone on till Mum this years . Im 55 years . Prior to Daniel I had run a successful Family Day Care business for 17 years . My Service had been accredited by the National Quality Framework Exceeding . I re opened my Service 22 months after Daniel passed . Mum passed 3 weeks into reopening but I was pretty good, kept it running with experienced help, my daughter . I am so unmotivated , its stepped up since Covid I know I am hard on myself and feel you have to be actively doing something or be productive in someway otherwise its wrong . For me-that is. I was diagnosed with Adult Adhd at 48 year. My Support group now who I am truly grateful for are all paid people but without them not being on my level or not understanding me , I don't know how I would've kept going .... Tears. I feel I have cried almost everyday at same stage during day for 2 years . Thank you ...Maree

My mum passed away on Easter morning in Canada during the COVID19 outbreak - but not from the virus. Australia and Canada closed their borders to international travel before I could get on a plane to be with her and my Canadian family. The world was in lockdown. Since then I‚Äôve gone from being an optimistic and calm person to being paralysed with grief and anxiety. I can‚Äôt seem to function in any normal way, have cancelled virtual meetings and now have severe gastro and convinced I have COVID.. My husband is being supportive and we‚Äôre using virtual platforms but nothing seems to help. What else should I be doing to move through this?

In my experience with my own grieving and observing others, there is an initial period where others input has virtually no effect.
During this period, which varies in length depending on the person, we can be there and listen, reassure with comforting words etc. However it can be counter productive telling someone ""you'll get over it"" or ""its for the best"". That's because pure 100% grief hasn't room for logic nor room for reason nor explanation. 
What if you are the person in grief?. After this initial period, there will be a time when you'll return to your pre grief life, work, shopping etc. But you'll still be in grief. This is the point at which I encourage some strategies. Eg
Im dedicating next year to my father. He'll want me to be as happy as I could be.
Im going to create a corner of my garden to my sister. A place with a garden seat and climbing roses, her favourite flower
My brother did not enjoy good health. I will in his honour, care for myself because he never had that opportunity.
And so on.
The art of channelling, which is what I referred to above is infinite in its realm of creativity and its an individual thing. It can make us extend ourselves beyond our projected capacity. Ever seen Olympians dedicate their journey of competition to a loved one?
But IMO the greatest motivating factor is children. Those of us that have walked that dark path of suicidal thoughts and/or plans know that thinking of how we will leave our loved ones in trauma and grief can be a huge motivating factor for us to sever the idea and dedicate our lives to our children or loved ones.
When I lost my wonderful dad I decided to ensure I would one day leave the world of my children with a similar memory...
In summary-
To assist yourself in coping with grief, allow yourself a period of time that you alone feel is the right length of time to just grieve....and not much else except comforting others.
Then put in place ways of honouring your loved one and living your life as they would want you to.
Finally, not to make their passing in vain. Grab hold of their legacy they've left and in their name ...never let it go. For that memory is priceless. Use that gift to leave a similar memory for other loved ones you will one day leave behind.
Thats how I make sense of the passing of loved ones.
Do you have strategies in coping with the passing of a loved one you'd like to share?
Your ideas could help someone else

it‚Äôs been 6 week since i‚Äôve lost my best friend to suicide and i‚Äôm so lost. she was only 18 and we had so many plans together. she was my soul mate i swear. we never fought, we were so similar, yet so different. she was so beautiful and the most caring and giving person i have and will ever meet in my life. i‚Äôm so blank without her. i only turned 17 a couple of months ago and with this isolation, loss of friends and social contact and the ability to come and go as i please to the outside i don‚Äôt know how i‚Äôm going to continue to do this. it‚Äôs so hard. we continuously talked about all the stuff we were finally going to do when i finally turned 18 and now she‚Äôs gone and left me and i‚Äôm so lost, so lifeless. i just want her next to me, to just hear her sweet laugh one more time, or her beautiful smile. i‚Äôm just so empty, i have no care for anything anymore. and i wouldn‚Äôt per say i was suicidal as i could never even think to wish the pain of losing a loved one to my family and friends, but i just have no care anymore. i got in a really bad car accident 2 weeks ago where I could have died but i just didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt care. this isolation is killing me even more slowly cause i have no way to grieve other than crying in my bed or just laying there with no emotion. i just wanna know if there‚Äôs any tips or things i can do to fix me.
it hurts so much

Hi all,
So a week ago my husband of 26 years mentioned that friends of ours had emailed him with a family update for Christmas (my husband and he had worked together some years ago). So in a spare moment I picked up his iPad and looked for the friends email. Next to their email is another, and I could see the first line as you do in Outlook. It ready, ‚Äúit worked honey, I love you‚Äù. Of course I opened it and it went downhill from there. I requested an explanation... I was lied to..I persisted...more detail was given with reassurances that now I knew everything. More lies came out.  Only thing is, after 26 years, I know when he is avoiding talking about something. Fast forward to today. It is now one week later. I can‚Äôt eat, I feel sick. I feel so alone it is overwhelming. I am in so much pain I actually howled! As a military wife, I have always been the strong one, raising kids while he was deployed, dealing with career losses of my own because of postings, supporting my family and his family  - including supporting his Dad through a terminal illness and ultimately burying him while my husband was deployed. Everyone leans on me, and I don‚Äôt know how to deal with the pain, the loss, the sick feeling. How do I even begin to deal with this? And the harsh realization that I don‚Äôt have a support network. My friends are work colleagues from over the years or joint couple friends. I don‚Äôt feel I can turn to them.

So, I was really close with my grandmother and because of that when she passed away i couldn‚Äôt handle it. I couldn‚Äôt accept the fact of her passing away. I didn‚Äôt even get to say goodbye to her I couldn‚Äôt even hug her one last time. 

I feel really guilty for some reason. I kept on blaming myself for not realising that she‚Äôs ill sooner. I blame myself for not paying attention to her I blame myself for not making her go to the doctors sooner. I blame myself for not being the grandchild she deserves. It‚Äôs been three years and whenever I think about her I Can‚Äôt stop crying. I feel mad at myself and mad at the doctors for not taking good care of her. 
I try to get over it and be happy that she‚Äôs in a better place now but I can‚Äôt help it. I tear up whenever someone mentions her. There‚Äôs this sharp pain that I feel in my chest whenever I think about her and I can‚Äôt stop blaming myself. I really miss her hugs and her lectures, I really want to apologise to her and say goodbye properly one last time Hug her for one last time, tell her that I love her for one last time but I can‚Äôt because she‚Äôs not here anymore. 
i don‚Äôt know what to do and it‚Äôs killing me

Hi everyone,
This is a statement I never thought I'd make. I can finally understand why we have funerals.  
Yesterday hubby told me our friend had died in an accident. The last time I saw him was fleeting (work colleague of his needed help) so we didn't get to chat. I told him next time I wanted to hear all about his last skiing holiday. 
Now gatherings are banned due to Coronavirus. No funeral. No gathering of his and hubby's volunteer group to celebrate him. Can't visit his partner to help with cleaning or cooking... Nothing.
I've never understood the point of public funerals until today. Other funerals I've been to have been for family. I've been involved and included and it made me feel more upset having to grieving publicly. Now as someone who isn't family I think I'm starting to understand.
I feel like the point of gathering is to introduce his family to other people who loved him too. People they can ask for support. People they can talk to when they're ready to talk about him. Maybe even to share stories. 
It helped us to focus on what we can do right now rather than what we can't. 
Maybe someone might feel able to share what has helped you to grieve within the current restrictions?
Our ideas...

Hubby and I put a movie on for our kids and sat outside in the sun on the swing together. Just allowed ourselves time to sit together and think. 
I told hubby the two memories that always came to mind when I thought of our friend. When I feel sad I remind myself of those memories.
We chose to focus on the fact there is no time limit on grieving. When the restrictions end we'll ask his partner if she'd like to have a celebration and help organise it. If not that is ok too.
 Same with his volunteer group. We'll ask if they want to do something to celebrate our friend.
I wrapped up a box of shelf stable food and supplies. Nice things like coffee, tea, bikkies and chocolate but also basics like loo paper, UHT milk and tissues. Hubby went to the store and got what he could. I figured his partner might not feel up to shopping. We left it at her front door.
Hubby put a little money in the card. I felt weird about it at first but he explained the last thing he'd want on top of grief is financial worry. Makes sense. 
We put our contact numbers in the card too in case she didn't have them. 
In a week or two I'm going to leave another box. I'll print some adult colouring in pages and put textas and pencils in this one. Some seeds if I can find some.

Hi,
theres a bunch of reasons why I have to re home my two beautiful dogs. I‚Äôm moving interstate for work and can‚Äôt take them (they‚Äôre old and wouldn‚Äôt travel well plus inner city apartment living wouldn‚Äôt be fair for them). 
I‚Äôve had them for 9 and 8 years and even though I know logically the decision I‚Äôve made is in their best interests, I can‚Äôt help but feel overwhelming guilty.
A rescue group has helped me to find a suitable new home for them (so they could do all of the proper checks etc that I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to do as well) and they‚Äôve found an amazing family for them. I have to meet at a park next weekend to hand them over.
i feel like I‚Äôm letting them down. I feel like a terrible human - they have loved me so much and the last thing I‚Äôm doing is giving them up. 
Not really sure how to get through this pain.

I recently lost my best friend of 21 years after a long battle with cancer. My friendship with her had plenty of ups and downs but we always found our way back to each other. I have bipolar disorder and for awhile I pushed everyone away including her. After about 2 years I finally reach out to her again and our friendship picked straight back up like we never spent any time apart.  I spent her final year speaking every single day and I was last friend around when her final weeks came. I spent her last day out of hospital with her and was her final text message. Now she's gone and I feel so alone. I might sound crazy, but I always thought I'd get some sort of sign from her after she passed, but nothing. I'm so glad she's finally cancer free and pain free. I feel like I'm never going to have a close friend again. How am I supposed to make new friends without comparing to what I had. I keep thinking I'm going to get a text or a call from her any day now. I don't know how to move on from crying every night.

My partner recently had an abortion. We were in a long term relationship, she had consistent doubts about our compatibility and future.

Hi all,
I would desperately like to express my deepest feelings I had when I heard the news, if I could. Yet my mind fails to come up with a reasonable response like I didn't care. I DO care.
I'm stuttering to write meaningful sentences, but these sentences honestly feel dull and bland. One might say I sound neutral, but I'm not trying to be. I really do care about such a friend. It's almost as if my body feels painless despite being stabbed, and that pain can't even register. 
I had expected a simple conversation, the usual chats from my mother after tennis training. But the sudden gloomy sentence of ""terrible news"" had sent me into confusion. ""H passed away in his sleep this morning. If you want to say the last goodbye, I'll let you know when the funeral is.""
(I've abbreviated his name as I do not feel like disclosing it now.)
It was over. It could not be. He was such a great friend from primary school, and we stayed together until secondary school where I left to seek the prestigious schools. To see him gone and never be capable of returning just feels like being stabbed in the back, yet not notice any pain.""This fate just wants to take everything I love and slowly destroy it!"" I would think. Am I feeling insensitive, or is something wrong with me? 
 I wish I could have wrung out some of my spare time, perhaps to see him again, enjoy lunch together, to at least cherish our friendship once more. But as much as I beg, it simply won't come back. 
Sorry if I can't think of a better way to describe this event. Perhaps I'll return with more info when I make up my mind.

Hi all u good people

I'm struggling with depression a lot lately. And I'm still struggling with some losses in the family. The reason I'm posting here is I'm hoping someone might have some insight as to what might be going on. Am I still struggling with the deaths of loved ones ""because"" I'm having mental heath issues? or am I experiencing depression (at least in part) ""because"" of my personal losses? The deaths in the family have happened some time ago and I'd have thought I should have moved on by now.

Lost my dad 2 years ago to cancer, this one hurts most, the ground just doesn't feel solid anymore, he was my rock
Lost my sister and niece together tragically and unexpected 7 years ago and my mum died shortly after due to complications from a rare blood condition (and I believe sadness after losing her daughter)

I only have my little sister left out of my immediate family and I need to be present for her and for my wife and kids, and I'm not at the moment.

I was there on the Saturday afternoon you were born and then on the Saturday you left us. It has been the thirteen longest years of my life and I mourn your passing every day. It is said that time heals all wounds but that is just a fallacy, this is one that wont heal until we meet again. I still feel an immense anger toward your treating Physician and his lack of concern on the day you passed.
The death of my son brought great sorrow to all those who knew him. He was a very strong boy and had the nick name of 'Boof Head'. This he earned during a junior football game when he carried a number of the opposition on his back and scored a try. His greater passion though was baseball. He commenced playing tee-ball at age 5 and continued on through to senior level. While as a junior he represented the local area in the 'State Cup' competition. My boy's other passion was his own son.
He passed away in February, 2006 after being in Hospital suffering from ‚ÄúGoodpasture Syndrome‚Äù in his lungs. For a month he was placed in an induced coma and was given chemo therapy, blood cleansing treatment, blood transfusions, treatment for this, that kind of treatment, nothing seemed to be fighting against this anti-body disease of unknown origin that had my son in it's grips. On January 30 that year while visiting him in Intensive Care, his mum, fiance and myself were taken aside, behind a curtain and I was to receive the worst birthday present any father could be given. The ICU Registrar advised us that because my eldest was so ill, he wasn't expected to make it through the night. A couple of weeks later they took him off the respirator and brought him out of the coma. The battle was over. My son had pulled through. As a celebration of his home coming, we all went for tea. It was a fantastic Friday night dinner. One I'll never forget.
He passed away the following day.
His funeral was held¬†around 10 days after his parting. There were approximately 300 in attendance from all walks of life. School friends, baseball, work and even politics. I was amazed how many hearts he'd touched in some way in his short 23 years.
Mate your death has affected me in a way that is just so hard to explain. I look forward to meeting and being with you in the after-life. Be it tomorrow or whenever.

So two weeks ago my mother shared that she has been diagnosed with terminal cancer (5 years tops), a few days after this my grandfather (who I was very close to) passed - its not like the movies with the shutter of the eyelids. He was in panic as he went. But to keep the rest of the family in happy oblivion I lied and said he passed peacefully in his sleep. Last week we buried him and it nearly broke me while I tried to keep it together for my family.
I have put my studies on hold while I deal, reached out to the cancer council and have an appointment coming up. It was just, so much sadness. But it soon turned to anger. Before leaving to spend time with my family, I left detailed instructions for my boss to pass along to my team, so that the office could keep going in my absence. When I came back (today) I found out that the email had not been forwarded on, that no work had been done, and that stakeholders were angry with me for not contacting them for near a fortnight (the stakeholders anger quickly turned to the company and they apologised for their rude emails after a quick phone call explaining the situation). So now I have to deal with a fortnight backlog daily. 
I don't know what to do, I am just so angry with my work for being incapable of so much as forwarding on a message (it's diverting my emotional energy away from my real feelings I guess). At the same time, I am still grieving, I can't so much as make a cup of tea without breaking down in tears. But with no leave, sick days or savings all I can do is grudgingly go back into work.
I feel so pathetic, I can't deal with my Pops recent death, let alone my Mums encroaching one. I don't want to be a sad sac, but I can't find joy in anything and dread waking up each morning. I don't know what to do and it makes me feel pathetic (that 'glorious' spiral, am I right?) I haven't been suicidal for a few years now, and I'm not, but this is some new low I didn't realise I could get to emotionally. Should I divert the energy into going for other jobs? Should I run away and take a job in another country again? What should I do while I wait for the cancer council to contact me? I just don't know...

I'm having a hard time dealing with all my grief i think of got depression. My whole life changed i can't seem to be happy ever. I'm 29. I watch my nan pass away with dementia in August 2018 she was a very big part of my life. Then in March 2019 i  watched my sister give birth to my neice with passed away right there in the delivery room. Then in May 2019 my beautiful mother aged 57 passed away from cancer. I've lost people before but living without my mum is really painful. Since mums passed ive started to use drinking & drugs to numb my pain. My realatship with my bf of 14 years is starting to change my everyday living has i dont seem to care about anything anymore. I dont know how to handly all this loss in 8months of eachother. I dont feel ready to talk to a dr its to painful to say out loud to a stranger. I'm really lost atmüò≠ ive been griefing alot to i dont talk to my silbing about our I cant put that sadness on tthem or worry..

I'm curious as to what you all might perceive as the main differences between grieving for a human vs grieving for a pet.

For the last few months I‚Äôve had a new psychologist, who has really helped me and gave me hope for the future, and she got me, and made me feel accepted and understood.  Last week she told me she had resigned from her current position and is leaving.  I am devastated from this loss and feeling overwhelmed with sadness.  I‚Äôve still got one more private session with her and two group sessions before she leaves, is it inappropriate to ask her if when she‚Äôs settled in her new job, to be able to see her again in that setting?  I don‚Äôt want to come over as desperate but just need some feedback on this subject, ‚ÄòLoss of your Psychologist‚Äô.
Thanks in advance for your advice and for reading!!

Hi all,
 
I am new here and thought i'd seek some support
 
My dog suddenly took a turn for the worst Friday just gone, she has had joint issues most of her life in which we were managing quiet well with medication. I went away for 3 weeks and left her with my friend she had a great time - 1 week in being back with me she was still doing great being her old self. She is 12 years old we have been to the after hours vet twice over the weekend and her regular vet twice due to her distressed, being uncomfortable, in pain and crying. She was given more pain relief and we thought after the first visit she would bounce back to herself..(normally she would) but she didn't - My regular vet opted to try laser therapy Saturday to see if that helped (of course i was eager to try anything to help ease the pain) and also to visit the pain clinic to look at Nerve Blocking (I did not want to put her through this due to having to redo the procedure every 3-6months if it actually worked) i weighed the pros/cons and came to the decision its not fair to put her through that, and the laser therapy would take time but it wasnt time that my doggy had but we still tried to atleast give a little comfort. On Sunday we went back to the vet (4th visit) and i was a complete mess crying. The vet agreed with me when i meantioned to put my girl to sleep and that was hard to get the words out (my head tells me dont do it! but my heart tells me its the right thing)  i cant have her suffer anymore, its not fair shes not getting better. all i can do now is try to keep her comfortable - today we went for another laser therapy session and i asked to book to put her to sleep tomorrow (Tuesday) that was really hard as all my emotion came out. Today i also took my girl to the beach one last time, gave her a plain sundae, potato and gravy (all her favourites!) but now, im just trying to comfort her and i just get emotional, im scared & im scared for tomorrow i dont know how i will cope - i have never experienced this before. i have my partner and hes been great, hes been in my girls life for 10years now so he's feeling the pain aswell. i know soon she will be at peace

Hi all,
My parents were both diagnosed with terminal cancer, we lost mum a month ago and now dad is back in palliative care.
im struggling so much with the loss of my beautiful mum and also having to revisit the hospital/ward she passed away on every day to see dad, as well as dads drastic decline in the last few months.
im not sure what I‚Äôm wanting from this, maybe hope that I can make it through and support to keep being strong. Every day is a struggle and I haven‚Äôt had time to process what has happened with mum in between caring for dad.

Hello 
im trying to grief for my mum who passed away June 2019 
I have to girls aged 4 & 2 and I have my supportive husband 
I really wanted to connected with anyone that is going through the same thing and help me through my dark days

So my stepdad died two and half years ago at aged 42 due to a cardiac arrest. He was a dad to me for 20 years and also a father to my two teenage brothers that are now aged 15 and 16. 
When he died I was 23 and I moved back home to support my mum and brothers and I did so for 9 months. I struggled coping with my own grief while supporting everyone else‚Äôs so I eventually moved to Canada (my mum is Canadian and all of her family is in Canada). My mum was very supportive of this decision and said that she just wants me to be happy. I met a Canadian man and we‚Äôve since moved home to Perth - we‚Äôve been back for almost a year now. My mum is still majorly depressed, not eating properly, barely sleeps, and feels very lonely and like she doesn‚Äôt have a support system.
I have dealt with anxiety and depression for years, and had a very complicated relationship with my stepdad for a very long time (however I still loved him with all my heart and his absence from my life still takes the breath out of me. I often have dreams about him and wake up hyperventilating and crying). My heart aches and I want to help my mum, but I also want to live my own life and it takes so much effort just to keep my own head above water. 
So my question is what should I be doing to help her? How much responsibility do I take on for her happiness and wellbeing? I have suggested psychologists many times and she refuses. She says she has too many issues that have been repressed for decades and she wouldn‚Äôt survive talking to someone about it. She did start seeing my kinesiologist after my stepdads death and it helps but only does so much. She also isn‚Äôt a very social person and because of this has very few friends. She‚Äôs also just been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes so she can‚Äôt eat so many of the things she loves which I know hasn‚Äôt helped. I hold so much guilt over not doing more for her but I‚Äôm constantly told by other loved ones in my life that it‚Äôs not my responsibility. That at some point she needs to pull herself out. I just don‚Äôt know.

Hi there
I lost my Mum to lung cancer Nov 19.
She had been told in September 19 following surgery Jul 18 that she had 5 years.
The surgery she had was for a different type of lung cancer. During the operation they cut her
Main artery and she lost 3 litres of blood and was lucky to survive.
Her recovery was slow and she developed a cough. She was put on antibiotics but unbeknown
she had developed small cell carcinoma which has a low survival rate.
She went in to hospital for a bronchoscopy to determine the cough and development
Of atrial fibrillation. I stayed with her for a test (3 day stay in hospital) and she died 9 days later.
Iam struggling as she was told in September she had 5 years as the op in July 19 was successful.
I was holding her hand when she died.
She was my best friend and was 75 and full of life.
I have no close friends (ai moved to Vic almost 3 years ago) so feel alone. 
I'm not sleeping and I focus on things I did wrong over the years rather than the
Good times.  I beat myself up.
I kept a small urn with some of Mum's ashes as she is interred in another  state.
I hold and kiss the urn daily. I feel I am in denial/shock. I MISS HER.

Three months ago my mum lost her battle with cancer. All my mum did for the 18 months that she was diagnosed, was talk about the fact she was dying. Every conversation surrounded death to the point that I tuned out to it and then when she did actually die, I couldn‚Äôt believe it. It‚Äôs like I became desensitised to her dying to the point where I didn‚Äôt actually believe she would. 

I coped ok for the first two months. Just did what I had to do. I was more angry than anything else. Then something inside me broke and now I have to take life hour by hour instead of day by day. I‚Äôm absolutely miserable. No energy. Showering feels like a massive task. 
have been to the gp and see a psychiatrist For medication. I‚Äôm currently trying a third medication but feel so so low so don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs helping. Psychiatrist wants me to stick it out another couple of weeks but surely it should have worked by now. I‚Äôve been on it around 6 weeks.  I‚Äôm miserable. So stuck in my own head with the circling thoughts of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point in life‚Äù ‚Äú why are we even here‚Äù. I wish there was an off switch. 
I have three kids, one being only 4 months old and I need to live and not be such a head case but I just can‚Äôt function. I barely leave the house these days. Maybe once or twice a week when I absolutely can‚Äôt avoid it. 
I‚Äôm so sick of feeling this way and I hate myself for it because I should have the power to turn it off and change but I just can‚Äôt.

Hi all

I'm new to this forum, and not really sure what to say. I'm just a bit lost and stuck and in a confused space of grief and loss.

I lost my partner to suicide 18 months ago. It was a surprise to us. Although she did have some problems in the past and, as I've learned to process since her passing, was a functioning alcoholic.

I've spent so much time making sense of things. Processing my sadness and guilt and trying to understand and forgive her... And now I feel like I've lost who she actually was before all this trauma. I'm not really sure how to extrapolate what I have been left with, while also appreciating our life that was. I don't recognise it any more. I am numb to my present. So am stuck. And sad. And sometimes really desperate. Sometimes I am happy. I do have lots of love around me. 

I feel like I have my head under water, and am content swimming beneath the surface because when I come up for air it's all too much and it makes my head spin.

I'm not sure what anyone could possibly say, and I'm not sure that there is anything to be said. I guess I just needed a forum and space to put my feelings into words. It's comforting to read the honest stories and supportive responses. There are a lot of brave people in the world and on this forum. It's inspiring.

Hi guys,
This is my first post on here so i am a little nervous and unsure. But yesterday i had a really bad accident and backed over my families new puppy. He was gone pretty much instantly. We had only had him less than 3 days and he basically stuck to my side every hour of the day. He was always following me around and would do everything i did. I had no idea he had gotten out of the house and followed me up to my car, and so when the accident happened i was just in complete shock and overwhelmed i had the worst panic attack i have ever experienced. I still feel so guilty and just in shock, i have no idea what to do or how to cope. I have suffered from anxiety for many years now, and have had a few depressive episodes but this feels like the worst thing that's ever happened to me. I know it was an accident and there was no way i could've known he was there. But i just, i don't know what to do and i don't know how to get past this pain. I know it is going to take time but i just feel so guilty and i cant stop seeing him just lying there. It hurts to know that he was only there because he wanted to be with me and next me.
 
Please help me know how to process this and recover from this.

Two years ago on the 30/11/2017 I received the call that my beautiful 25 year old daughter had died by suicide. I have three children and my daughter was my middle child. The life of the party, my biggest supporter and never a day went past that she didn‚Äôt tell me she loved me. I fought hard for justice for my child and was left to handle everything as my husband struggled to cope. As I fought for my child I also found out that my husband of 30 years was having an affair with a woman known to me. I overheard his drunken conversation to her as he was describing me as disgusting to look at and how wonderful she was. The next day I phoned him and he was with her on our new boat named after our daughter (they both laughed because she went on the boat before me). I spent over 8 hours that day begging him to come home. He agreed to counselling and trying to put our marriage back together. Nothing has changed, with him doing whatever he wants, relying heavily on alcohol and telling me to get over it. This is a man I loved. This is all too much and I struggle more and more to find reasons to go on. The woman I see in the mirror is disgusting. I went back to work, am studying and trying to like myself but I don‚Äôt know how much I can take. He refuses to sell the boat and when I go to my car it is the first thing I see. My other two children don‚Äôt want to talk about their sister and I continue to pretend I‚Äôm happy when I‚Äôm dying inside. My husband just things I‚Äôm a fool.

Today I am dealing with a overwhelming sense of sadness and guilt. 7 years ago my sister and I had a falling out over some issues related to her relationship with my parents. It was after being the person stuck in the middle of this constant fighting between them, I cut all ties with both of them for 12 months and didn't allow my children contact with either of them. At the time I said some pretty nasty things to both and felt a massive sense of relief. 1 year on I was able to repair the relationship with my parent but remainded estranged from my sister and then nephew who was 7 years old at the time. I loved my nephew, however I didn't want to engage with my sister which mnt I couldn't engage with him. Over the 7 years of separation I have attempted to repair te relationship with my sister on 5-6 occasions but phone or text and she has choosen to not respond. I've respect this and not pushed after the initial text or call. 1 week ago my nephew was successful in ending his life. I have felt nothing but sadness and loss at this and reached out to both his parents, to express my sorrow for them and also myself. Today my sister made contact with me and and said that I would be happy that my nephew had passed away and that how dare I make this about myself and text her 3 times. I feel guilty that I've made her grief worse and I've clearly misread the situation. I feel helpless and so bad.

I lost my mum 2 weeks ago tonight. Since her passing, I don't feel like I am present at some points during the day (if that makes sense?) I am so very fortunate I have had an amazing amount of support from close friends and family, but I feel like I am failing my family (husband & 3 young children) I am not sleeping well at all, my mind is constantly ticking and thinking of so many things, it just won't switch off. My husband has been more than incredible, but I feel so guilty that I am not helping him in the capacity that I usually do. I have this overwhelming sense that I have to be strong for my kids and that I must get on with life as the way it was vs then not having the time to adequately grieve the loss of my mother, who I loved so much. I am just so lost. I feel that I am overwhelmed with not being able to control my emotions the way in which I usually can. I am unsure as to what to do next? Should I seek medical advice re: not sleeping? Thank you for taking the time to read my post.

My mum passed away 7 weeks ago now. Although not completely unexpected as she was unwell, it was a shock at the time. My reaction has been so strange to me.
 The funeral was a wonderful gathering of family and we all supported each other and there were tears and lots of hugs and lots of love expressed. But now I cannot feel any emotions when I think of her loss.  It is as if I am numb. I don't understand this as I had a loving (but sometimes complex) relationship with her. And when I lost my dad I had a completely different experience of grief which felt more immediate. 
Two things have happened recently....I seem to be getting snappy with people whom I am close to. It is as if little things are triggering my temper and I am short and cranky. I can only assume this is related to my grief. I have not experienced this before. Has anyone else experienced something similar? 
The other thing is that my grief associated with another loss in my life (an estrangement from a close family member) seems to be dominating my thoughts and feelings. I feel this grief often, but since my mum died it seems as if it is so much more intense. It is as if I cannot grieve my mum as my loss of another is so dominant. Does this make sense? Is this possible that my grief for my loss of my mum is being overshadowed by grief of another? 
I really don't know how to understand all this and I certainly don't know how to feel about it all. 
Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated.

Hi guys, 
Today I release my brothers ashes into the sea over the cliffs where we released mum mums 2 years ago.. It seems so sad that my brother and I were there not long ago doing that together with my dad and now he won‚Äôt be there.. well not in real life.. it‚Äôs so soon to return there and now to release him.. he didn‚Äôt get over my mums death.. 
today it will just be myself and my dads girlfriend which is sad and not what I wanted.. esp the gf part.. dad moved on when mum was dying.. I had to battle to stop her coming to my mums ashes release.. but I have no fight left and if it makes him happy then I have to stop trying to be my mums advocate just like today I have to just be and not be my brothers.. except for making sure he got laid to rest with mum.. he chose not to be here anymore and died on the anniversary of her death..  it will be a hard day but hopefully I can find some will to live again after this instead of going through the motions.. just a shame it had to be at Xmas time..  anyways thanks for giving me a place to share.. my life was so different before all this loss...
thanks guys

I've been separated nearly two years from a man with PTSD and major depression.  Despite every opportunity to recover he seemed determined to destroy himself and everything around him. He wouldn't cooperate with doctors or treatment, blamed me and others for all his troubles and doggedly pursued a destructive lifestyle. In the last year we were together I couldn't shake the feeling that someone, somehow was going to die. I thought it would be me or the kids - his behaviour was just so appalling and reckless - but as it turns out he simply killed himself; a few months ago he was diagnosed with end stage liver disease. He won't have more than a few months. Here's the rub: Obviously he's sober now, and that makes a difference, but he's also coming back back to the man I used to love. Kind, funny, sweet and caring. It's like a weight has lifted off him and he's dropped his anger and hate and is just living for the moment. I drove him back from a medical appointment recently and we laughed, told stories and talked about the kids. Compare that to a few months ago when I refused to take him anywhere in the car out of fear he'd run us into a tree or under a truck - he was that bad. I don't love him anymore but God I feel sorry for him. If only he could have learned this lesson earlier, opened his heart and mind to recovery, he could have spared us all so much heartache. Right now he could have had family and friends around him to hold his hand and tell him they love him but he's lost it all. It's just so sad.

Hi this is my first post here. It was 2 years ago in September I lost my mum suddenly to lung cancer. She died 2 weeks after diagnosis. She was my best friend and the only person that really understood me. 2 years on and I still don‚Äôt cope at all not a week goes by I don‚Äôt breakdown crying. 
I have 2 young girls the youngest was 3 months old when she passed. I‚Äôve really struggled with my kids since she‚Äôs gone my mother gave us so much help and now that‚Äôs it‚Äôs gone I don‚Äôt know what to do she was our only help we don‚Äôt have much other support. I want to be a good mother but find it hard when I feel depressed alot. 
since she has been gone we have had family rifts I don‚Äôt speak to my brothers anymore and I have now lost some close friends. I feel at times I have no one left me and my husband barely talk anymore he was helpful in the beginning but now I feel my cry‚Äôs for help just go unnoticed. Feels like everyone thinks I should be over it by now but life is just getting worse not better. I know I need to seek some help but find it hard to ask I‚Äôve always just managed on my own.

Today I found the loss of my mum quite shit to say the least. I am in the process of getting treatment for depression which has been delayed due to insurance (hopefully approved next week!) but its been a hard slog and my mum passed in 2017, so the grief is still pretty raw. She was with me through past episodes of depression and just life in general and now that shes not is bloody hard. My psychologist doesn't think we should talk about my mum's death just yet until I try sort out my own stuff, I agree but maybe its time in the next few weeks.

Recently our much loved son, nephew, grandson, husband and father committed suicide.  It has been devastating and incomprehensible.  My family has been ripped apart and are attributing blame to each other at a time that we should all be comforting each other.  I sit at home every night and cry and drink.  Has anyone else suffered a lose like this and how did your family cope and help each other.  I am feeling so miserable and helpless - it's been three months and nothing is getting better.  I never thought my family would behave like this during such a sad time.

Hi all, 

I've had depression since I was 16 (25 now), my dad was my rock, the person I turned to after a horrible day and was my biggest cheerleader always. Sadly 4 months ago he had a trail bike accident and passed away. I remeber the day like it was yesturday, getting the call saying he had an accident thinking yep that my dare evil dad just being himself, waiting for the call to hear where the helicopter was taking him, laughing with my sister about how dad won't even wait to the cast is off before getting back on a bike. Almost an hour went by of me freaking out waiting to hear, then my partners phone rang it was one of the guys at the track with dad, he face said it all, I know my dad didn't make it. My dad had a brain aneurysm pop and died within mins.
It was the biggest shock of my life, I regret not going to the track and seeing what was taking soo long, for so long I thought dad would come around the corner and say hehe just kidding like one of this horrible jokes that have gone to far. 2 weeks after my dad passed away my boyfriend asked me to marry him, he told how the last time he talked to dad he asked for my hand in marriage. 
I'm really struggling trying to understand why?? 
Why did he have to go soo young?(aged 50)
He will never meet my kids or be at my wedding. I love my H2B but every time i get upset he tells me that he understand that he knows how it feels. Some time I want to yell at him and ask him how he knows what it feels like when you still have your dad. 
My depression is worse then ever and it's really effect my relationship.

I‚Äôm 18 years old and at the start of this year my mum died so very unexpectedly. It‚Äôs been 9 months without her and I can‚Äôt explain how much I miss her she was my best friend she always had a solution to every problem of mine and for some insane reason I keep thinking that she is going to come back and everything will go back to normal but it won‚Äôt. It hurts my heart physically hurts and I don‚Äôt know what to do to stop it, all I want is to just see her face and hear her voice and just hug her so tight. Just mum and I lived in a small house together, mum had been sick for few weeks prior but doctors just kept sending her home with different pills to take so she went to the hospital one night from still feeling unwell, I was happy because I thought that she would get the medical advice and treatment she needed and be home in a few days, that night I got a phone call asking if it was me and was told to come up to the hospital so I did. I got there and all the doctors kept saying to me was ‚ÄúHannah your mum is really sick and it looks like she might die‚Äù as I waited for the rest of my family to travel down to the hospital I sat by her bed side in the ICU unit and watched my mum die then had to tell the rest of my family when they got there. I keep reliving this day over and over in my head and I have dreams at night about it, it makes me feel sick and makes me feel so sad I just couldn‚Äôt do anything to help her. I don‚Äôt want to live my life with out my mum, I feel that I will never be properly happy again. I want her here with me it‚Äôs just so totally unfair. I don‚Äôt understand what I did to deserve this kind of pain. The last thing I thought that would happen this year was I wouldn‚Äôt be finishing it with my mumma, this year by far has been the worst year of my life and I cannot wait until it is over.

Late in 2018 I lost two family members very close to me. First, at the end of August someone who is like a second father, who has cared for me since I was 6 months old finally passed away after a long hard battle with cancer. I had received messages from my 'sister' days earlier telling me that his health was rapidly declining and that I should come visit him as they didn't know how long he had left. I was so busy with work shifts all over the place that it took a bit before I could organise a time, and I finally planned a day I would go and visit. A couple of nights before the day I had planned to visit, I get a phone call from my niece saying I should come urgently as he was getting even worse. I was prepared to head over there and then, but because it was late at night, we both agreed I would come early the next day. 
The next day, as I'm getting ready to head out there I get a phone call from my niece again... in tears telling me he was gone. I'd never experienced the death of someone so close, so I didn't know how to react and my instinct was to be the strong one, and I held it together, suppressing my emotions through everything so that everyone else had someone to lean on. 

Fast forward a couple of weeks, I had a holiday I had booked for months to go to Japan. But I don't look at that holiday as a good holiday. As the day after I returned home, my grandfather passed away. A little over a month after my 'Dad' had passed away. I had so much suppressed emotion from his passing that when I found out about my Poppy I broke. I was an emotional shell for months afterward, and I could not sleep.
I didn't catch up with my Poppy (grandfather) right before we left for Japan, even though he wanted to catch up for dinner the night before we went away. He rang me, but I was so busy packing and when I checked the message I had already eaten dinner. So I didn't ring him back even though I had spare time for going out with him, and told myself I would contact him when I get back. I never could. I still have the messages on my phone, saved, so that I could hear his voice. 
It's now been a little over a year since they both passed away and I still have dreams and nightmares. I still have so much grief and guilt about losing them both, I feel so guilty about all the times I didn't catch up with them and how distant I was. I don't know what I can do, but I've been so lost since. 
I have never experienced this, I don't know what I can do.

My grandfather who I am very close to has had an unfortunate decline in his health and we have been told to start making preparations. 
I previously have lost my father and my grandmother and was not able to handle grief very well at all. 
Can anyone recommend any books, resources etc to help prepare for grief and cope with loss?
 
Thank you in advance

It's 2.15am I sit here looking out the window once where my husband sat doing the same thing in March before he went into hospital for minor medical condition and did not come home.  Today at 10.00am I spread his ashes across my home and say my final goodbye and to gives us both peace and harmony.  I have not said my final goodbye to loved one in this manner before in my life so do not know what to expect when I open the urn to set him free!  I feel so numb with nothingness and feel my anxiety is bad as I have been extremely itchy on my palms of hand and scratch and scratched so much that I have scratched marks in my hands but with that at least I feel the pain.  I chose today as it is hubby's 60th birthday and have bought a bunch of rainbow roses that have scent in his memory of his great life!  Yesterday I was supposed to work a shift but clean forgot that I was rostered on.  I have never missed a day's work even due to depression or anxiety but I sit here with a smile on my face and think of his life and love.   RIP Bazza.

Hi,
My beautiful little girl was killed when a 100kg truck wheel fell on her almost 10 weeks ago.
I rushed my daughter to the local Hospital in a minute or so, but the blunt force trauma was too great for her to survive & approx 30 minutes later the ED team had to call it off as she was gone forever.
It has been almost impossible for me to work & think clearly but I need to try & continue my work so that I survive financially.
Only time will tell if I can stay afloat.
The negligent tenant who stacked the truck wheels against the outside shed wall appears to not care, feel any shame or embarrassment for his actions & has continued to attend & work on his junk in the next door storage shed whilst I'm trying to work. He has walked past me several times & acted as though I'm not even there. He has shown no remorse, given no apology for his actions & didn't even clean up the junk that he left lying around outside the storage shed until I put in a official complaint about his junkyard.
Everyday has been a roller coaster of emotions, my disbelief that my little girl is gone forever, my disbelief that someone could be so stupid to lean truck wheels against a shed wall unrestrained in a Public access walkway to the Toilets, Anger that this has happened to an innocent little girl that should have been safe & had walked to the Toilets many times without incident.
I just don't understand how this has happened & that nothing seems to be happening to punish the negligent party.
My 7yo girls life was cut short by the stupidity of a Truck Driver who had no excuse for his actions, He had plenty of time & plenty of available space to store the wheels safely but chose not to. I don't see that Justice will ever be served for his actions & it only hurts more when I'm told that my little princesses life is worthless under Australian law.
Time does not heal all wounds & whomever came Up with that lie has never lost someone that they truly, deeply love & care about.
This tragedy has only continued to grow in its abilty to break our family more as time goes on.
The problems that it causes multiply everyday & I know I will never get over this loss.

I have only just lost my mum and I'm feeling so empty, broken and sad sometimes I think about self-harm (I will not do this as I have two kids to live for). How do I try and get back to a normal life. I miss her so much.
",Grief

My 14 year old son took his life 2 years ago but I don‚Äôt believe it was suicide. I won‚Äôt go into detail but we found evidence he had been self-harming for sometime. The police didn‚Äôt look into this further and it was put down to suicide. So for almost two years this is what I‚Äôve had to try to accept even though there were no signs of depression and he was otherwise completely healthy, happy, confident and capable young man. But I just don‚Äôt accept it now. I have no way of proving it. And I don‚Äôt even know where to start to get any support. My partner is not convinced, but he is still in denial about everything and we can‚Äôt talk about it. The rest of the family, except my dad, all carry on as if it didn‚Äôt happen and it‚Äôs almost like my son never existed! I‚Äôm desperately miserable. I try to carry on but some days I just don‚Äôt see the point. Today is one of those days so I thought I better come here. Thanks for listening.

My mother died when I was 11 (many, many years ago) and my sister died 4 years ago. Both had long illnesses and suffered drawn-out deaths. For me, watching both of them die was very traumatic and for years I've had to deal with anxiety, depression and PTSD. Quite often though I feel like no one understands (except my therapist), so I guess I'm just reaching out to see if I really am alone in this or if there is anyone else who knows what a double loss feels like?

Hi everyone. 
I lost my mum to suicide a month ago, she tried to commit suicide when I was 35 weeks pregnant. 
Due to her drug use and mental health I made the hard decision for her to not meet my newborn child, one month ago my mother commited suicide. She left letters and basically blamed me and wrote that I was never going to let her be a grandmother.. I have so much guilt and regrets on not letting her meet my son. 
At the time of my decision I had the right intentions but now that she is gone I am struggling so much.
I am loosing focus while driving, I seem to not have any confidence I second guess my self a lot which is dangerous behind the wheel. 
I am not one to talk about my feelings I normally ""bottle it up"", but I know I am not okay. For my son's sake I want to get help, my dad is not around and I only have one sister left. 
My fiance and his family are a great support, I don't have many friends.. 

Has anyone been through this before? Have you lost confidence in driving and had bad anxiety in the car I am getting to the point where i do not want to drive and don't want to be in the car at all.

I‚Äôm not really sure what to say or why I‚Äôm here. 
I‚Äôm struggling a lot. My boyfriend and I ended out three year relationship (amicably) on Sunday. We just weren‚Äôt the one for each other. Regardless he was my best friend and the one I always sought support and comfort from.  I left at 9pm Sunday night. 
9am Monday morning, 12 hours later, I took my precious 10 year old cat to the vet for a check up. I only recused her two months prior but she was a shining life changing beacon and lit up my whole life. 10 minutes into the appointment the vet told me she had aggressive cancer, was in significant pain and suffering, and there was nothing to be done for her. It was completely unexpected. I held her in my arms while she took her last breath and let her go that morning. 
I knew my boyfriend and I would break up that weekend. We had both planned it and wanted to spend quality time together to just enjoy the good parts before we went out separate ways. I had no idea my little cat was unwell and I would have to end her life that morning. It was 12 hours only after breaking up. It hurts because if it has been 12 hours earlier my best friend would have been there with me and comforted me and supported me through the grief. But we broke up so he‚Äôs not. I told him what had happened and he was sorry but didn‚Äôt want to be involved or change things. 
Im struggling ALOT to just function. Eating, drinking, using the toilet, sleeping, socialising, thinking. Life just seems completely and utterly impossible. 
I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends and don‚Äôt have family aside from my mum, who lives interstate. She‚Äôs helping as just as she can but I‚Äôm just so lost and feel alone in this grief.  I don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôm supposed to be grieving, my beautiful cat who was my family, or the loss of my relationship. 
I don‚Äôt really know what to expect here. Am i overreacting and being too dramatic?

Hi, my husband lost his mum to cancer last week and has had to travel to arrange her funeral. It was sudden and the plan was to return a week later but he has had to stay another week to next Thursday. I am feeling at a loss trying to cope with three children (7, 3 and 10m) at home without him. Very sleep deprived. I am feeling this abysmal pit in my stomach, anxiety and sheer panic that fills the emptiness of time. This happens every time my husband leaves me with the children and it harks back to a deep seated fear of being left behind on my own and I suspect it can be traced back to babyhood when my mother gave me away to my grandmother to care the first 9m of my life. At the moment, I find it impossible to fill the time between sleeps. I also don't know how to support my husband through his grief. When we spoke, he is also not coping. I feel like I am sinking into a pit of depression whilst also contemplating mortality. I knew my mil and my mum recently too completed chemo for cancer. I don't want to burden my husband further with my insecurities and these worries and anxieties as he has enough on his plate atm dealing with family and burial politics.

I am 43 years old and 3 weeks ago tomorrow I lost my 43 year old husband to brain cancer. He was first diagnosed 12 1/2 years ago. The past 6 months was awlful then at 1:20 on the morning of the 22/07 he took his last breath. I feel completely heart broken. Sometimes I feel I just can‚Äôt breath. I am lost and have no idea what I‚Äôm suppose to do now.

Autopsy doesn't show heart attack etc.  Workplace is not saying anything. At the moment we (myself and two adult children) are awaiting further results from the autopsy that was performed. Could understand if he had died a natural death but the unknown is killing me. It's been two weeks tomorrow and at the time we couldn't even see him for 6 days.  Don't know what to do. It is just an emotional rollercoaster. Legal, official, workplace, Worksafe (investigating). Just sucks big time at the moment.

This is my very first post in here so please bare with me.
1st September 2019 (Fathers Day) my Dad started planning his ending, he wrote multiple suicide letters, people saw him on the 2nd and the 3rd and said he seemed like his happy self, he sent my sister a Facebook message on the morning of the 4th, nothing that warranted concern. No contact after that but that wasn‚Äôt unusual.
7th September his body was discovered.
he lives back in New Zealand, I live in Perth, my sister dealt with everything.
for the first 10 days I felt numb, but I was holding on to the fact that his letter to me would give me some kind of understanding, some kind of closure?
the Police back there contacted me on day 10 to explain the process and to let me know all his suicide notes would be delivered to the correct people... also to inform me that I was NOT one of the people he chose to say goodbye to!
I am heartbroken beyond words that I didn‚Äôt mean enough for the goodbye he was able to give my sister and multiple other people.
I don‚Äôt know how to move on from this, closure seems impossible.

I wish I felt anything but anger when I see a pregnant woman, affectionately caressing the home in which her baby grows safely. Pain wears the veil of anger so as not to be seen. It buries itself deep in the heart of me where it is safe from the eyes of others. I feel my stomach fall and hot tears prickle my eyes. They are cautious; refusing to fall and expose the pain. Anger surfaces in its place. Who can wear this anger for me? Who can take it off my hands and lessen the load? There is no one to give my anger to. I sit here and wear it, wishing it wasn't mine. I run my hands over my broken and battered body; the body that couldn't make a home for the babies I loved. Loss after loss after loss. My body fails again. Silent rooms and empty ultrasounds plague my mind. Rivers of unforgiving crimson rush from my body and tell me it's over. With them, they take a part of my soul never to be returned to me. Sterile white walls of hospitals become witness to the deepest pain I've ever known. I don't think I can get up again. The pain is just too much to carry. Am I being punished for being home to depression? Can you not be home to the deepest sorrow and the most exhilarating love at the same time? Is there someone out there who would have loved harder and laughed more often? Does she get to wake with hope each day instead of crippling fear? Would that make her a better mother? It doesn't seem fair. I know I can walk alongside my depression and love fiercely at the same time. I have all my life. So what makes this different? Do I not deserve to feel the depth of this love? Families grow around me one by one. Babies are born and lives are changed. And still I sit here as anger masks the pain I don't want seen. The world shifts and changes around me and I'm stuck; unmoved. I smile as friends share their news and allow the tears to fall freely in private. I question how I will live through pain that feels so permanent and unchanging. And while it feels impossible and beyond my capacity; I do it. I walk through the rawness of the pain and continue to live. I have thought I shouldn't be alive because of my broken body and hateful mind. And yet I am here living. Instead of the pain making me wish I could leave, I now know how to carry it and live alongside it. But as I sit here in the cafe watching the expectant mother caress her stomach with loving anticipation I wish I felt anything but anger.

I'm in year 7 and yesterday I suddenly lost my mother due to a heart attack. It had been very sudden as she had been fine the day before.
it is so hard to cope with, my mum was the only person I trusted and now she will never get to see me grow up and graduate school, we had so many plans made for life including an amazing road trip visiting one of the places she had always wanted to visit.
i can't stand to think that she will never be back, she will never get to know her grandchildren. My children will never ever meet there grandma 
My mum, she was so beautiful, so kind and nice and was always there to greet me when I got home from school, she was so supportive in helping me in my first year of high school
im crying here as I write this, it is heart breaking. I didnt think the first funeral I would ever go to would be my mums

My partner and father of my 2 children of over 15 years passed away 14 years ago. I never got the time to grieve for him as my children were young and I had no time to fall in a heap so just kept on going on. But on the 14th year of him passing I'm finding myself starting the grieving process. I don't know what to do or how to feel or how to get through it. I have happily moved on and married to a wonderful man but  finding myself crying and not being able to control the tears when they flow. Any answers on how to get through this would be grateful. I have made an appointment with my doctor to talk to him about it. I have cried my heart out to my husband, he wants to help but doesn't know how. Any help would be appreciated. Thanku

My Nan had a massive Stroke around 2 months ago that took basically the whole right side of her brain. She was a fit and healthy 83 year old woman. She is paralyzed on her left side and can no longer speak and they did not expect her to survive the Acute phase, but she did and made it all the way to rehab. In the last few days she has been switched to Palliative care and will be gone within the next week. I am absolutely devastated. She is my best friend and like a mother to me. I love her so dearly, I am just  completely heart broken. I am going to see her every day, but watching her deteriorating is cruel. She is the most kind, selfless and beautiful person I have ever met. She does not deserve to die like this. I want to wake up from this nightmare. When she had the stroke, I grieved knowing I would never hear her voice again and would never see her return to what she was. Now I am sick to my stomach knowing for the first time in the 23 years I've been alive, she will not be there for Christmas or my next birthday. I will never hear her voice again, or hold her hand, I will never get anpther hug or kiss and she doesn't get to watch my daughter grow. She is also leaving behind her husband of over 6 decades. I don't know how to cope with the pain. It comes in waves and it is unbearable. I don't want her to go, I am cherishing the time I have left with her, but it is not enough. I am studying full time and starting a new job on Monday, I don't know how to cope with all of this. I just want her to stay with me.

I am struggling with severe anxiety and get so overwhelmed with constant thoughts of how terrible and disturbing the last days were before mum died at home, that the room starts spinning and i literally fall on the floor sobbing and cant stop.. its been 2 months and i just feel worse and worse, i think the palliative care team do a wonderful job but they really didn‚Äôt prepare me for how - i hate to use these words - gruesome and disturbing the last days could be. I feel like its a taboo subject that no one wants to talk about the days before and how the actual death are, its certainly not like you see it in the movies. I am trying to find someone to talk to about the palliative care experience. It all feels like a nightmare that i cant wake up from

Well 7 days ago I found out she had kidney disease and they stopped working. she passed away 3 days ago. She left a hole in my life thats filling with depression, im trying each day to crawl out of this mental depressive hole but get pulled back into it as there are triggers all around me.

It started off as a normal day until the horrible screeching of my mum on the other end of the phone. 
63 years old died suddenly at home why hanging out the washing. So young so much more to do with his life he was still working full time. 
My dad was my everything a hero my mr fix it my best friend. I feel like I‚Äôve been short changed, my son is 15 month and loved his pa so much. Not to see him grow up with my dad breaks my heart. 
My mum suffers from anxiety I'm the only one holding her together. There‚Äôs so much pressure on me, I have my own problems my own grief. I didn‚Äôt really get to say a proper goodbye at the funeral I couldn‚Äôt carry the coffin or get up to make my own speech at the funeral as I had to help mum. 
Im not resentful, I just feel sad that I could not do theses tasks like my brother and sister. There is too much pressure I just can‚Äôt breathe because of all the paperwork, finances issues and arrangements. 
I feel numb, tired and I just want to understand why! Just why my dad, and why know! There are so many in answered questions. 
So much I want to say to him. does it get easier?

I am just finishing my Certificate IV in bereavement support and my idea of doing this course was to be of help and an inspiration to those suffering grief in some way or the other either through the loss of someone or something they held dear to them.
Having lost my son aged seven years in an accident  a long time back I went through a lot of pain anxiety depression and lived with it silently for many years  i could never share with anyone my feelings and panic attacks fear uncertainty I really could not do the things I wanted to do I took me a long time to get over this not even anti depressants could help it was only my will power and my spiritual life that I was able to find my way through it all and after years of struggling with anxiety fear and emotional problems withdrawal physical problems caused due to emotions headaches etc. I now can confidentally say I have made it through and am strong bold and courageous I can face the world .
 
It is with this determination I am now completing my course so that I can be of help to those battling anxiety depression and suicide and give them hope for the future and teach them how to overcome these emotional problems and enjoy life to its fullest and as long as there is life there is hope.

It‚Äôs Fathers Day and it has been the first Father‚Äôs Day I haven‚Äôt been able to spend with my dad. 
he committed suicide just before Christmas, with no warning signs. My whole life I never knew what he was dealing with by himself.
thats the part that hurts the most, I‚Äôm more angry at myself that I never knew, never considered, how selfish of me! 
He left without one last phone call, nothing. And we are left with no closure, I keep reading this letter he wrote over and over and it brings me nothing but confusion. 
He was meant to walk me down the isle in a couple of months. I had just had my second child, he adored his grand children. I don‚Äôt understand how he could just leave us like this.
And now we all have to just try and get on with things, but how do you do that?

I don‚Äôt know how to help or how to grieve. The father of my children passed away late last year we had been separated 10years but for the majority of our separated time we co-parented quiet well with 50/50 care arrangements & 98% of decisions made for the children we made together
5 months later my own Dad passed away he had lived with my children and I for 11 years. Dad and I were close I supported him when we lost mum 12 years ago and done everything in my power to make his last years here as easy and as comfortable as I possibly could. My children aren‚Äôt coping with their grief one can‚Äôt find a job the other struggles to attend school each day, home just feels like a shattered mess where we just tolerate each other. My ex‚Äôs girlfriend is trying to obtain his super, and has all of his belongings. They lived together only 10months and she believes she‚Äôs has more right to these things then his actual children. (My kids were extremely super close to their dad). They are shattered hurt angry sad and missing their dad beyond belief. I don‚Äôt know how else to help them to get through these times. We all had our first Father‚Äôs Day without our dad‚Äôs this year and I made sure I was with them to get through the day but my own feelings of grief made it hard to be the supportive mum I needed to be.

Hey everyone,
I‚Äôve just joined this community and thought it was time that I try and reach out or open up about my emotions.
18 years ago I was born a triplet. One of my sisters passed away months later as a result of being premature and having a bad heart. In that process, my Dad was told that I should‚Äôve died, I wasn‚Äôt breathing and was in an induced coma. Honestly, the guilt I feel is earth shattering when I think of her passing on but not me.
Then, 2 years go by and we learn that my Dad has cancer, more specially melanoma. He had numerous melanomas pop up around his body which killed him by the time I was 4.
When I was about 7 my nan had passed away from cancer too.
Prior to being born, 2 of my grandparents were already passed.
I‚Äôm 18 and have been feeling their losses significantly every minute, especially in the last couple of years. I can‚Äôt escape it. It‚Äôs as if I hadn‚Äôt dealt with it until now. I find it hard to not think about these days. I find it difficult to not feel guilty. I find it tremendously difficult to feel some type of happiness. I‚Äôm at quite a low point of my life, if I‚Äôm completely honest. I thought I may as well try and reach out on here before it becomes too much.
I have my sister and mum left but any other family members i have had left our family for numerous reasons. I guess I‚Äôm just trying to find a way to not feel so alone, so dark and empty.
If anyone has any advise or feels similar, please let me know.
Thank you for taking the time to read this, I appreciate it greatly.

I posted a couple days ago about the slim chances of my father surviving a battle with cancer and liver problems, unfortunately we lost him yesterday morning.. and it's the most painful thing i've ever felt in my life I feel so completely lost and distraught without him.. he did everything for me and my mother and brother and sister, my mother and I especially. I'm 24 still living at home and have terrible social anxiety so he has always done everything for me.. whether it be just going into a shop to get something for me when I cant or coming to doctors appointments and setting them up for me, ontop of that he looked after my mother who has MS. He was everything to us, the most selfless caring beautiful man and now he's just gone.. my memories are all foggy and I keep trying to remember the good things but alot of the time i remember him and his face when he was in his hospital bed. I want to hug him so tightly and apologize for not appreciating him as much as I should have but I cant.. I just want to hear his voice or his laugh.. I don't get how to move on from this, I miss him so so so much. My mother is so hurt too, she's in a nursing home 40 minutes away until we can get her closer and i'm just in the house alone with all dads things and these memories and I just don't know how to cope.. 
I wrote out a letter and had my aunt read it to him next to me telling him some things i'm glad I got across but his eyes were opening a little and closing all throughout it, i'm not sure whether he heard it because he was so so out of it but god i hope he did. 
You really realize how much you take your parents for granted when they're gone :(

I lost my younger brother who was too young to die. I am in Australia and he lived abroad. I had recurred brain cancer, radiotherapy and chemotherapy didn't help. He was struggling numbness on half of his body. He was expecting help. I googled to find alternative options where I came across to restricted ketogenic diet. I suggested him to try this and he went to that diet, we hired a dietitian. After two month MRI was clear and he felt improvement. We don't know if it was from the therapies or from the diet. He continued to work keeping the diet although it was hard. After two month, he felt strong numbness on half of his body. He went to doctor, doctors could do a surgery but there is a big risk that may be paralyzed or die. We refused surgery, but during 1 week in hospital his health deteriorated, was struggling to walk. But he said, brother I will keep the diet, not going for surgery. I was still in Australia organizing my trip back to home. I was seeking a doctor who can help him, found one in India. When I arrived he was already paralyzed, having difficulty to talk and sleeping a lot. I was too late, he was going to die soon. I talked a neurosurgeon in the capital, he asked to bring him. We brought him to hospital, stayed for 3 days, and they said they can't operate him anymore. Unfortunately, every time we visit hospital his health was going back more faster than at home, I can't understand. Traditional treatment wasn't helping him. Doctors said he is going to die in couple of days. They sent us back home. I googled again and found a doctor who treats patients with herbals. She gave some herbals which they may help. I refused drugs that doctors prescribed, because wasn't helping. Herbals looked like helping for some days, we saw a bit improvement. After ten days he experienced strong epilepsy when my mum and brother's wife was looking after. They couldn't help, it time before my another brother arrived and help. When I arrived doctors were to help. We took him to local hospital, he spent another 10 days with resuscitation. I cannot forgive myself, because keto diet didn't help but might progressed tumor. I cannot forgive myself coming home late to bring him to India, which might prolong his life. I can't forgive myself for refusing drugs doctors prescribed which might prevent epilepsy. I can't forget days he was expecting help, struggling from pain, couldn't speak last words because of resuscitation but hearing us telling lies that he will be fine.

Hi there, have been very good since the past couple of posts. Just the past couple of weeks have gotten me down really bad. My grandfather has recently just passed from lung cancer he was a very big father figure in my life and my Grandmother who has been a very big mother figure has been diagnosed brain cancer again. But I've just started dating a girl who we both get along very well and after 4 months I couldn't be any happier. But since my grandfather's funeral I've been really anxious and sad. My mind seems to be melting because I feel like me being anxious all of the time is jeprodising my relationship with my girlfriend. I love her and care about her in every way but I feel like me being sad and anxious is making me critical with things like ""shes a really annoying today"" when before my Grandfather passed I could tolerate alot of that. I would never want to leave her, whenever I do think about doing that I feel really sad for her and myself like it would be torture for me to do that. I mean I'm always on edge and everything seems all to much. I love her and id do anything to be with her but sometimes it's all to much for me I don't really like the fairy tale stuff where it's like "" if she's the right one she'll make you feel happy 24/7"". I'm not a big fan of that. I guess my question is mostly is this a normal side effect in starting up relationships in my situation. Because I feel like I'm really alone in my thoughts and I can't tell anyone without upsetting someone.

Lost my dad on new years day to dementia. He gave up about a month beforehand and just stopped eating and drinking. He come good again and then refused all foods and fluids again before he passed. He suffered before he died. I didnt make it to his side in time. I feel regret over this. He was in a nursing home and he always said to me to never put in him care, which I  feel regret about. The home was wonderful to dad, I cannot fault the care that they gave him. I do miss him terribly.

I lost my grandpa just over a year ago and I‚Äôm not taking it very well. We weren‚Äôt that close and that‚Äôs the thing that bothers me. I feel like I should have done more to try and get closer to him and to have a better relationship. It was hard though because he lived three hours away so I could only really call him but still I didn‚Äôt even do that. My dad is taking it hard as well because it was his dad and I just guess I‚Äôm feeling really guilty and wish that I could‚Äôve done more to be closer. 
My grandma passed away 3 years ago and she died of cancer. She died because she didn‚Äôt want to have chemo because she didn‚Äôt want her hair to fall out. I wish I could have talked her into having chemo she maybe she might still be alive today. And I also feel the same way with her as my grandpa. I just wish I could have called them more and told them I loved them and gotten to know them as people more. It was hard because my parents didn‚Äôt want to drive up there so I didn‚Äôt have a super close bond with them. We only really saw them on special occasions like Christmas or Easter and still that wasn‚Äôt enough. I just miss them and wish I could talk to them again. Recently their house sold and I guess that just made me finally realize how real it is that they‚Äôre gone and that I‚Äôll never be able to see them again or talk to them. I went up and packed away their things and I just started balling and I guess the realization that we are never going to see them and that I didn‚Äôt even get to tell them I loved them one last time hit me. I would never get to hug them or play cards with them or anything ever again. It just makes me sad whenever I think about them and I try not to but every day I just get this feeling of guilt that I should have done more but I know I can‚Äôt. 
i miss them so much :‚Äô(

Dear Forum,
We lost our 29 year old son due to suicide one month ago. My internal clock stopped then. If you asked me the date I calculate it from the time he died. Outwardly I look to others like I am amazing - back at work, went to a conference last week. Internally, I am an absolute mess, foggy, teary, and really wanting to be left alone except my husband. I do have an incredibly understanding husband and a psychiatrist.  
We don't want to share the details of our son's death, except with medical professionals and a very close inner family circle. I don't want to be re traumatised by retelling the story and don't want to be defined as the mother as son committed suicide in a horrendous manner. We want to control the narrative. That is 'he has been ill for some years and his death was sudden and we are all very sad?' Is this OK? 
All that is important is my son is  no longer with us and my heat is bleeding. Any suggestions for immediate ideas or actions from those who have been in this situation on how to cope over the next few weeks?

Hi, my names Wade, im 29 and i have a 5 year old son. This year has shaken our world and changed the outcomes of our lives.
In March, we lost our rock, our guide, the third piece of our family jigsaw puzzle. My partner of 10 years, my sons mother, passed away due to a sudden asthma attack at our family house.
Unable to help, and having to watch it all take place is a realm i wish no one enters.
Whats even worse, the paramedics came, before her fatal cardiac arrest, and mistreated my girl, because she was only 25 years old, fit and healthy in every other way, the paramedics assumed a panic attack and made her walk! to an elevator and down 6 stairs, even though she begged them not to move her, even though she told them 'i feel like i will die if you move me'
clearly if you cannot breathe, your going to panic right? this i will never understand.
The paramedics had all the information in front of them, they knew they were there for asthma, yet while inside they took no vital observations, did not monitor the heart, or even use a stethoscope. The assumption of a panic attack was made within the first minute of speaking with her, and that choice to move her without observations was fatal.
I am currently going threw investigations with the QAS and Health Ombudsman , which will prolong my experience even further.
I want to warn you all with loved ones with asthma. Asthmatics get good at living with their condition, so good they can hide and mask how bad they really are. My girl was an expert at this, and when the paramedics arrived she was able to converse in full sentences without a wheeze, this is 10 minutes before a cardiac arrest.
First assessment no one would no she had asthma, even though she said she was worried about it and wanted it checked up, but they didn't want that, they wanted her to walk to the ambulance so they could get her to hospital in case it was to progress.
Seems fair, but the moment she stood up, tears ran down her face and she knew it was not right, and begged for them to help her.
Arrogant young paramedics kept telling her to calm down, your asthma is fine there no wheeze, your just having a panic attack.
The way i see this, if she was 80 years old, and she said she feels like she will die, they would not have moved her.

The asthma was there, and always the concern, but had the paramedics spent a bit of time and done an examination, they wouldnt have moved her, and maybe avoiding the arrest.

Hello, nearly exactly one year ago the father of our daughter, who will be turning 6 in September, took his own life. We were not together as a couple for around 2 years leading up to his suicide as he became agitated and frustrated and threatened my safety and my daughters. 2 months leading up to his death we had a massive argument which lead me to seek legal advice after a violent outburst in front of our daughter/ smashing my phone (not the first phone he had smashed) but our daughter was older and understood and still to this day brings it up. I never wanted things to end like they did as I loved him so much/ I just feel like I pushed him too hard and he couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore. I still can‚Äôt make piece with the fact that he was so desperate he killed himself and left behind his family and friends but most of all his beautiful daughter. I cry so much as I‚Äôm so overwhelmed/ I work full time, raise or daughter by myself, run a household and take care of me too/ I feel like breaking most days.... I do have a great support network and I do reach out when I feel I need help with practical things but the grieving isn‚Äôt over for me. I do have a psychologist for both myself and my daughter, I wish I could talk more to my family friends though. It feels as if a time frame has been put on my grieving and I still feel like I haven‚Äôt even began.....

Hello all,
Im 28 years old and I‚Äôve lost both my parents. I lost my dad to cancer in 2010 and then my mum to suicide in 2017. I had a great relationship with both my parents and mostly with my mum who was my best friend. My mum had bipolar. Despite this she was an amazing mum and did so much for me and my siblings. I am yet to have children or get married but I have an amazing partner who I plan to do both with over the coming years. I understand why my mum suicided. But knowing why doesn‚Äôt really bring me much comfort. I feel empty and lost. I miss both my parents terribly and even though it‚Äôs been 9 years since I lost my dad and 2 years since I lost my mum the pain is still so raw. I have times where I feel really positive and excited for life but then I have real down times where I don‚Äôt feel anything and I shut off from my friends and the world. I‚Äôm on medication to help my anxiety which I‚Äôve suffered with for a long time. It got really bad about a year after losing my mum and I decided I needed help. It helped lots but I feel like I‚Äôm back at that place. I‚Äôve deleted all social media and I‚Äôm avoiding the world and hiding away like I don‚Äôt exist. Do you ever ask yourself why you....why has this happened to me...it‚Äôs unfair! I just need to know other people feel the same way as me and understand this empty feeling I have inside me. Thanks for listening! Xx

Tomorrow another year to remember my lovely gentle soul mother who would have been 98 this year. She had the most gentle kind nature and I am proud to call her mum, friend, ally and more. She was the world to me and miss her. It will be 4 years in July exactly 5 days after my birthday and though time fades, never my memory of her.
She always supported me through my days before I got diagnosed with major depression. All the ups and downs she remained true. I am truly thankful for my 4.9 (no. 5' tall mum would insist. ha ha) tall mum. How I enjoyed our outings together, our sense of humour and the love she gave me. Thank you mum for all the good times.  I remember when I got angry, she would say talk it out as its better to have an empty house than a bad tenant - meaning don't let all the anger stay inside. I will visit the cemetery and have my memories and remember.  Enjoy your mothers every day not just one day a year. Life is too short. Will be glad when I can join her someday.

My gorgeouse niece left us yesterday, she died in her fathers arms. I have taken care of her full time since she was released from NICU in Janauary. She basically was my daughter, even my sister, her mum, said this is so. They had to call the Ambulance on me as I triggered a anxiety attack that put me into shock. I could hear and see everyone but couldn't communicate. Everyone's worried about me but all I keep thinking about is my beautiful niece. 

I cannot sleep, I've surrounded myself with her clothes and toys and just piled them on me. I have all her stuff throughout my house. My car has her childseat. I'm broken. I don't know if I'm strong enough to not slip back into full blown depression and anxiety again. 

Seeing my other new born niece today and holding her I just kept thinking of how my other niece would hold my fingers like that and how I would look into her eyes. 


Please someone just talk to me.

I'd like to share my recent experience with a blighted ovum. I haven't been able to find much online support so thought i would share here in the hopes of talking to others.

Like alot of people, i had never heard of a blighted ovum before. I started to love my baby and get excited and plan for the future like most women do when they get that first positive test. But to find out at 6 weeks that there was no baby growing, but having all the symptoms of pregnancy, to then have to go through the process of a miscarriage, was traumatic for me to say the least.

It put alot of pressure on my relationship too as my husband and i came to terms with what was happening. We didn't handle it well which added to the pressure and sadness.

It is such a difficult thing to go through and im finding there is really no support for women like us. 

I know i am not alone in this experience and would love advice on moving forward.

Hi, Don't know really where to start or what to say. But I guess my current struggles are with losing my Dad a couple of months ago to cancer.  My Dad is my hero. Like most girls Dad's are. When my Dad got really sick and we knew we only had a few months left with him, I moved home to help my Mum care for him and to spend as much time with him as I could. But that entire month I was there, it was so hard as I watching my hero deteriorate. I watched him take his last breath and sat with him and told him how much I loved him. I just miss him. Miss him more and more every day. I feel like since losing him I have lost my will, strength and determination. All the things he instilled in us as kids. I have no drive at work, I keep making mistakes in life and I am so angry at the world. Something little will set me off and then I feel embarrassed for my going crazy and yelling at people. I feel like a failure all the time and that I'm just a crappy human. I just feel really lost and if he was alive I'd be letting him down with how I am acting. He wouldn't be proud of me and that makes me more upset.

My mum suffered from severe depression and bi polar disorder . 
I always thought she was going to get better but after a 15 year struggle and after us kids trying everything to help , she took her own life at the age of 61. 
Her later life was one of utter suffering everyday she lived in loneliness and isolation . We would visit as often as we could but Mum was Usually very intoxicated on prescription medication and alcohol.
This is the lady that cared for me when I was young , she did love me but she had been taken . 
I tried so hard in the hope that Mum would get better but it was not to be . I look into the eyes of my boy who was born 2 months after my mum died and know that Mum would have loved him . 
The feeling now without her is sadness at the level of suffering and loneliness she went through every day . 
When death came she was alone , she would have been so  scared ..

Hi everyone,
I had a miscarriage 12 months ago - I‚Äôm 40 years old. It‚Äôs turned me into a completely different person! I‚Äôm always angry, so angry. It‚Äôs turned me off any kind of intimacy with my husband  and I just feel down and angry all the time. As the months go on I get more angry as I realize i am further away from having another child - time is not on my side plus I‚Äôm tired all the time.  My daughter is 3 but I really wanted a second child.
I‚Äôve been grappling with the idea that perhaps a bit of depression is creeping in......... should I go and see a GP?

Hi i am new here. I am recovering from a breakdown, hoping someone else understands and has advice. The last 3 years has been too much and i broke. Losing the 2 people who meant the most to me plus my dog, grief, sadness, disappointment took over and i ended up in a black hole. I have improved somewhat but finding a new set of challenges. Now im just losing friends coz i dont meet their expectations. They offer help in the form of information and if i dont do what theyre suggesting, then it looks like i dont care. Im always misunderstood when someone is upset with me. You know what i mean? Like i really want to be like this. My body and mind are slowly recovering but it takes time. I have had major physical symptoms to the point of thinking i was dying and its all from stress. I would like to be whole again and im getting there but losing jobs and people along the way. Everytime this happens, depression gets worse and i withdraw again. Where has my fight gone, motivation?  I am sick of being judged when i dont go out of my way to hurt people, just doing the best i can. Its not a lot, better than last year and its something, baby steps. People dont get it and i feel like an island.

Hi, I haven't posted for a while,my son had 75% 3rd degree burns and suffering all manner of problems. We went out bush off grid for a while and my son appeared to be getting better. He still had his moments,though. I'd gotten him off all pain killers except panadeine forte, and all other meds except anti depressants and mood stabilizers. There was light at the end of the tunnel {and it wasn't the train}, until Sept 21 when he'd gone to town for the day,and was hitch hiking home that night when he was hit by a car and killed. We are so devastated, and finding it hard to get on with life...although I know he's not in any more pain now, I miss him so much.

On the third of April my father who I was extremely close to committed suicide, with no signs or goodbye.. I'm shattered  I need my dad. üò≠
I'm so angry not at him but at myself for not sensing it, how did I not realise. 
I still don't quite believe he is gone, and I don't want to believe it I don't want it to feel real. I'm scared i just need to talk to him, I need him. 
I'm 21 with a 1 year old and I can't help but loose it after trying to keep it together infront of her and I'm scared I'm damaging her by crying and yelling infront of her, and that I'm going to ruin her life by doing so so then I get angry and feel guilty for that too as well as feeling that I'd be disappointing my dad aswell because he believed I was an amazing mum. I don't know what to do or how to cope, I feel so empty, numb, broken, in shock, heart broken. 
I can't help but feel I wasn't enough and I'm angry at myself for that, why would he leave meüò≠

Hi. This is my very first post. 
On Wednesday (12/6/19) I got a phone call that my perfectly healthy Mother who was 58 had died. 
I had seen her the evening prior , my son and I often visit 2-3times a week after school pick up. And 2 days a week she would pick up/drop of my son at school. 
She seemed fine. Happy. Making jokes with me. 
 
That at night she went to bed and didn‚Äôt wake up. 
i am absolutely devastated , I can‚Äôt get the memory of that day out of my head. The picture of her lying in her bed, looking like she was just still sleeping, won‚Äôt leave. 
Im scared to go to sleep. Im scared I won‚Äôt wake up or I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll replay it again. 
Im scared I‚Äôll forget all my memories and I‚Äôm scared my children will forget her. 
i feel so much sadness that I didn‚Äôt hug her goodbye on the Tuesday night and I didn‚Äôt tell her I loved her enough. 
im finding myself going in waves. One moment I feel okay. I can accept it then the next I just wish I could rewind the clock and somehow stop it? I‚Äôll be fine. Then I‚Äôll cry. Then laugh. Then cry. 
i don‚Äôt know how to deal, what am I meant to do? 
How can I make sure I don‚Äôt forget anything? And how do I make the feeling of loss go away? 
 
I have  two children who absolutely adored their grandma and they are dealing with this so much  better than I.

In my 40th year, I finally found the courage to speak my truth and report my Childhood Sexual abuse from the ages of 6- 13 years old, perpetrated by my stepfather. I grew up in a very large extended family. My mother had 4 sisters all married with children, so a large group of cousins and we were all very close. 
My relationship at around my 40's, with most of my family including my mother and 2 step brothers (born after my abuse) was extremely strained, to say the least. One of the biggest factors contributing to this breakdown was that my mother initially believed me when I finally told her when I was 15. She left my abuser, then apparently did a backflip after attending counselling sessions together. 
In those sessions in the mid 80's, he admitted the abuse to the Department of Families and Communities investigators and used a recent stint in jail for Heroin Possession as his reason. The department deemed me no longer at risk of the abuse as I was living out of home by then in various squat houses, on the streets and couch surfing, emergency accommodation, Juvenile lock up. Basically anywhere away from my abuser was apparently deemed safer.  My mother spent around 6 months apart from him before asking me to allow her to go back to him and then stayed for another 18 years and had 2 kids to him. 
For the next 3- 4 years I really tried to live with my abuser in my life to keep the peace as he was still with my mother. At 17, I was pregnant with a child I was determined to keep. At 18yrs old, I had my daughter and my boundaries became very tight. I started pushing back on my mothers lie to live in denial. She never wanted to mention the abuse again and the rug she kept shoving stuff under was getting a really big bulge under it. 
I haven't spoken to my mother since 2010, next year it will be 10 years of no contact. From the snippets I have heard over the years, my mother has told my family that my abuse report to Police was a lie and I was only out to get money.  My blood family not contacted me since my report and subsequent 5yr court battle until recently one of my cousins I was close to growing up called me and told me never to contact him again as he had to protect his children from people like me. I know that says more about him than it does about me, but man it still cuts deep and really hurts your heart. 
Day to Day now its not so bad, it shifts, if that makes sense? Id love to connect with others in this boat, How do you manage your estrangement?

7 weeks ago I lost my husband
after he had battled with cancer for 2 years.  8 years ago we moved to Australia to start a new life and join my
daughter and family.   My son also
intended emigrating here so it seemed the right thing to do.  Before she emigrated here my daughter said
she only wanted to do it if we and her brother could also come and so we
developed a grand plan for us all to be together and join my brother and his
family here.
After we had already moved
here as our first granddaughter was due, my son changed his mind and accepted a
job in the Netherlands.   After we had
been here 4 years my daughter and son-in-law moved abroad.  They returned after 2 years but moved to the
other side of the country to a remote area, 5,000 kms away.   I am now here alone, (my brother and family
are here but they have busy lives) and I feel that I have been abandoned and
betrayed by my children.  Life is not how
we imagined it would be when we decided to come to Australia.   I know your children have their own lives
but my daughter is the one who wanted us to come here.
I feel very alone and cry
every day for my husband and can‚Äôt believe that this is my life now and my
future has been taken away.  It‚Äôs so hard
being in this house living with an empty space where my husband should be.  Most days I wonder what is the point of
getting out of bed.  My instinct tells me
to go home to the UK, as I was always quite homesick and only came here for the
family and my grandchildren, but I don‚Äôt know if I could start again at age 69 my
and then I would probably not see my grandchildren .

I had a miscarriage over a week ago, and where all the love and hope I had for my baby was, there's just emptiness. My chest has been literally aching with grief. I go from feeling sad to feeling angry to feeling numb. Unlike loss of a family member or friend who made it into the world, it just feels taboo and confronting to talk about for others, and I feel like I am very isolated. Out of the people who I have spoken to about the loss, a few have been great, but a few have been insensitive, have tried to move the conversation on as quickly as possible, or have just not known how to react and withdrew support altogether. My boss told me she was sorry to hear, but then basically told me that I'm not the only one going through things at the moment. I felt invalidated. My husband has gone through the loss too. He's only gotten overwhelming support from those he's told, and he is feeling positive about the future and focusing on wanting another pregnancy. I am feeling anxious about the future, and terrified it's going to happen again. On top of problems already going on at work, I feel like I'm drowning now in stress and grief, and it's getting harder to catch a breath.

Hello all, 
My father passed away last year and he was an alcoholic, which was a major factor that caused his death. I drink socially and have never had any problems in the way of addiction or being irresponsible. Since my father's passing, I have chosen not to drink as much when I'm out but on some occasions where I have had a couple (as we all do), these feelings of guilt present. I get quite upset with myself and I feel bad that I'm drinking and that I have let myself go beyond my limits. I don't know whether it's because I don't want to end up making the mistakes my dad did or because I know that alcohol was part of the reason he died. I know I shouldn't let his mistakes affect my life but in the back of my mind something triggers this. I didn't have much to do with my dad for a couple of years because of alcoholism and other issues that stemmed from it so it's not like I think he will be disappointed in me. The grieving process has been a roller coaster but overall I feel okay, I have moved on and accepted what has happened, I just can't seem to shake this feeling. I hope this makes sense. 
Thank you for any insights you may have on this.

Please accept my apologies for the new thread below, as I am a new member and attempting to put my emotions in words is difficult for me. I know I am not alone experiencing this huge battle to get over the loss of a loved one. I am hoping someone may be or have been through similar circumstances.
 My wife and best friend of 49 years passed away from Stage 4 Metastatic Breast Cancer on Anzac Day. We knew this day was coming for nearly 4 years from the time of her diagnosis. We have been told she had the Cancer at least 3 years before diagnosis.
My wife and I accepted the diagnosis reasonably well and planned what we would do in between her treatment, while our medical team did everything they could and succeeded to give us 4 extra years together. 
I went to all my wife‚Äôs  appointments and treatments to give support. For the last year she found it difficult to get around which was devastating her as the pain was excruciating, but you would not have known. My wife always wanted to pass away at home and to facilitate this my two adult children, my wife‚Äôs sister and I looked after her at home during the last four days of her life.
I thought we had planned for this event, but nothing has prepared me for the depth of loss, loneliness, feeling of devastation (even though I have a fantastic family and friends), and a feeling of sorrow that I did not say all the things I wanted too, as I was too busy looking after her.
As noted above I have the best family and friends but I feel alone without my best friend by my side and feeling her touch and closeness.
What has kept me going to date, has been not to let my children down as they have lost their mother, and the fact that she was so strong during her illness and in death I keep trying to move forward through the pain using her example.
If anyone else has had a similar experience, how did you get through?

Two and a half years ago I lost my daughter. She died from drug toxicity. She suffered from depression. 8 weeks after that I lost my husband who had a massive heart attack at home. He was my rock when my daughter died. He was my common sense. He was my closest friend. For the first year and a half I just slept. To escape reality. I never thought I'd laugh again. Well I do laugh but most days I just feel like crying. Night time is the worse. Trying to get to sleep. I just miss them so much. The lonelyness is what gets to me. About a month ago I lost our dog. I thought every thing I love dies. I do have good day but they come in waves. In the last 5 years my family has lost my nephew, my daughter, my husband, and my neice. I grieve for my son who is still alive because he is in jail. It scares me to think I could lose him. Drugs hate them so much.Losing a child is devastating but losing your husband is too. I just wonder is this ever going to get any better. I still ask why. She was my baby. You are not ment to bury your kids before you. Thats a awful fact. My sister has lost both her kids to drugs. It sure makes you tougher that one thing I've learnt. Having to do all the stuff my husband did. Like I learnt how to use the compresser the other day to pump up tyres. I took the door off the wood fire to get it fixed because the glass was broke. Simple things like using the remote control. My husband never let me touch the one in the lounge room. I dont drink or take drugs so I find it hard to understand. What I'm asking is someone who understands all this grief I'm going though. Thanks.

Hi All,
I've just lost my Mum to cancer :( . She was only 64- way too young. She meant the world to me and so many others. I'm really struggling at the moment. I'm trying not to be grumpy with my wonderful kids, but feel it a lot of the time.
I also run my own business in the construction industry, and there isn't room for much time off due to project demands etc. I'm feeling both anxious to return to work, but kind of keen to bring the normality back at the same time. 
I'm thinking maybe a local support group might be good for me, but don't really know what to look for.
Any feedback/ suggestions would be really appreciated.

Hello,
It‚Äôs a long story so I will try and keep it brief. 
Two months ago my mum passed away suddenly. She went to hospital and had tests performed, the next day she was diagnosed with incurable cancer which had spread literally everywhere in her body, that night she went unconscious on life support, machine was turned off the next day and she died. She was 65. It all happen so fast and there was no time to accept or process what had happen during that week. 
That week we found out that she was keeping her symptoms from all of us. This doesn‚Äôt seem possible but surprisingly she was able to keep this secret until the day before she died. She would avoid doctors, tests, hospitals or any health interventions for as long as I remember, we could not even speak to her about her health or even if she had a sore arm. Suprisingly she looked well and still walking around a month before she passed, She deteriorated approx 1-2 weeks before passing but refused medical help and would not allow the ambulance to come get her, until the day she couldn‚Äôt breath properly (which was the day she went to the hospital before getting diagnosed).
she still didn‚Äôt want to talk to anyone about it in hospital and didn‚Äôt want to think about it. We never got any closure or any questions answered on why she ignored her symptoms and hid it from all of us. We have an idea on why but my mum is the only person who can really confirm.  
I never got to say good bye to her or comfort her during this time, by the time I flew to where she was she was unconscious on life support. We don‚Äôt live in the same state. Last time I seen her was 5 months before she died but we spoke a few times a week and texted most days.  Seeing my mum pass away and the viewing did not feel real and it still doesn‚Äôt. But what does feel real is that she‚Äôs definitely gone, and I miss her so much.
has anyone ever been in a similar situation to this or know anyone who has?
grieving is the worst feeling i have ever experienced and it‚Äôs a every day constant feeling of emptiness. Not only am I sad that I won‚Äôt see my mum again, I‚Äôm also thinking about what she went through alone, and many unanswered questions. I still continue to go to work, train at the gym, catch up with friends and family, as I don‚Äôt want to end up having depression.  Mornings are the hardest but as the day goes by it gets easier. 
hope to hear from someone.
thanks.

Evening all, I have never asked any professional person this question probably because it simply hasn't been a problem for me.  Nor is it now....but....I can't seem to find any websites, or long term effects, if any, or posts on Forum about ""not"" grieving  a close family member.  In my case, my mother when I was 16.
The reason I am curious if this is more common that usually thought....is that my sister died a few months ago and I didn't seem to ""grieve"" much then either, even though I had no ill feelings towards her.  In fact I felt terribly sad for her during her illness and problems through life and loved her, still do.   I wouldn't call it""grieving"" though.   (I have grieved terribly for pets...unrelenting pain, distraught with the grief, taking long long time to cope with that kind of loss...but with these 2 people, I seemed to just get on with my life).
Re my mother, I can honestly say I have never missed her, felt sad at her passing, wished she was here, been around to see my children, life's successes, shared my celebrations, not for one second, minute, hour or day since the Dr delivered the news at the hospital. Never felt the need to ""talk "" to her or share anything with her, ""ask"" her advice, cry for her....nothing!          Has this lack of grieving process at 16 affected me in other ways perhaps?   Is that really relevant anyway?     Just curious if anyone else ""non grieves""
Sending wishes for peace and love to you...thanks for listening...Moonstruck

Hello I recently lost my partner to cancer and am struggling with Insomnia at night and listlessness during the day. It is affecting my work attendance as well. I have a history of depression since I can remember and this condition is becoming worse.
",Grief
"
I'm feeling so sad, there is def. a piece of my heart missing. My youngest daughter took her own life, after a massive fight for the last 4 years against depression and anxiety. It started when she was only 16 that she was suicidal, after an attempt she was put into a mental health unit for 7 months. My husband and I were there every step of the way with her, she was sent back home and lasted 3 months, after continual attempts, was then sent to another mental health unit 7 hours away from where we lived. She was 17 by then, I lived in a unit at the back of the hospital for almost 12 months. They worked out it all stemmed from undiagnosed Aspergers.
Finally got her home in 2017 and I worked very hard to get her out socially again, half way through that year she went back to her old job, turned 18, and had a lovely boyfriend. Then last year we had a few bumps in the road but were constantly there for her and with her. Life seemed pretty happy for her. I was thinking too myself that 2017 was tippy toes, 2018 was baby steps and this year was going to be even better.
We had Xmas she told me she had a lovely time, we had a holiday with her in January, there were a few hard days there but we just went back to the holiday house so she could sleep. February she wanted a 20th Goth birthday party at home with her work friends with no alcohol. It was a lovely night.
Then I came home from work on the 1st of March and she had ended her life. The last 8 weeks have been a blur. We are all just heart broken and miss our girl so much, she had a wonderful sense of humour, the most beautiful smile, had so much love and empathy for everyone but not herself. Life is so very short. We loved her so so much. :( xx

I am new here, have never posted before.  
I am so lost.  I lost my brother a little over 12 months ago to suicide which has not only effected my own mental health and struggle with depression and anxiety, it also has caused a flow-on effect in my job, my living situation, finances, self-esteem, weight and everything in-between.  I feel like I've lost a year of my life, and I am still no closer to getting it back.  I just don't know how to function.  I am at work now and overloaded with things to do but cant seem to do anything.  I don't really know the purpose of this post  - I guess I just felt the need to share it and write it down... I have supportive friends but I feel like there is only so much depression from me they can take and they would just get sick of my issues.   I put on a smile everyday for everyone and yet inside I feel like I am breaking.  I was on anti-depressants but they caused me to gain around 25kgs so I stopped them.
I drink most nights...  I don't feel like I rely on it, it takes the edge off, but I never go to bed drunk or wake up hungover... I just have a few but I never really drank before and I wish I could stop. 
I miss him more than anything.  He was the kindest, most wonderful, most talented and thoughtful human ever.  I still don't understand why this happened.  He wol

On February 3rd my 16 Yr old son drowned. He was out having fun with his friends and got caught in a rip. 
His friends risked their own lives to try and save him. 
It's been 3 months since I last seen him. And I'm not coping. 
I have 3 daughters and a stepson I need to keep going for,  but I have nothing left to give. 
My partner is very supportive but I feel like I'm letting her down. I'm not the same man I was before this happened. I feel empty and lost and don't want to carry on.  Everything hurts

My ex who was also my best friend committed suicide last week. He was an ice addict of 20 years. I met him in rehab last year(me for alcohol addiction, Im 8 months sober) and we had an intense, immediate connection. I loved him so fiercely. I wanted to protect him and help him. He had the most beautiful, emphatic heart and I just adored him. He made me laugh, he made me feel love for the first time in so long, he made me glow as he walked into the room. Until a couple months ago we were in daily contact. But he was struggling with the normality of life, I wasnt. I was however struggling to help him and felt suffocated by his need for me. I tried and tried again. I kept forgiving him for his erractic behaviour, disappearances and looking back- i chose to believe him when things didnt make sense...was he using? I knew he used at least once. Was it more? I dont know. i felt responsibility for him. Eventually I couldnt cope and told him I needed to step back. I still loved and cared for him and would always be there there, I really did and I know he knew that but I just couldn‚Äôt be there for him as much as I initially was‚Ä¶I put off doing that for so long.

Our contact from then was sporadic. Late april he asked me for money as said he lost his phone and I sent it. He then said he was in Melbourne in a rehab and he was learning knitting. I was happy, he was safe. I was relieved. My last messages were ‚Äú did something happen? knit me some booties, :P‚Äù. But he wasn‚Äôt there. He was in Tasmania at his mums and he sent me his suicide message asking me to send the medics to an address so his mum didn‚Äôt find him. He said he knew from a young age that he wouldn‚Äôt grow old and for me not to go through the what ifs and not to be angry with him. I didn‚Äôt see his message for 40 mins and I called 000 and the police called an hour later and said they got there too late.

I am in so much pain. I feel physically sick with guilt. I don‚Äôt know how to go on. I don‚Äôt want to die but I don‚Äôt want to exist in this pain, I just want this pain to go away. He was everything to me and I can never forgive myself for not being there and not knowing how bad he was. I just cant see any light

My feelings of guilt, regret and saddness seem to build up and get worse everyday since losing my puppy. 
Willow was the rescue border collie x puppy I had always dreamed off. She was incredibly smart, beautiful and had such a happy and sweet nature. She loved everyone and was pretty much perfect (she didn't even bark and toilet trained herself). For some reason I was quite stressed, I was worried about her being stuck in our small backyard all day while my partner and I worked full time. Although she seemed so happy, had endless kongs and other toys/puzzles we had researched for border collies a part of me thought she didn't belong with us and that she should be on a big property with a family. Sometimes I would wish she was gone so the worry would go too. 
Other than that all was going well. My partner adored her and gave her a run everyday, on weekends we'd often go out with her. 
My dad started taking her to his farm on a Thursday while we were at work. I felt relieved that she had company for the day and my dad loved having her around while doing jobs around the farm. 
For some reason last week my dad decided to take Willow on Friday and spoke to my partner about her staying overnight. She had stayed previously once before when we went away. On the Saturday I had nothing to do so I decided to go shopping. That afternoon my dad was ready to take Willow back home but couldn't find her. She was hit by a car and died instantly. 
When we burried her I kept apologizing to her, I really feel like I let her down and wasn't there to make sure she was safe. I feel so awful for not being there as she's my responsibility, also for going shopping when I could've picked her up and not thinking about the dangers that were at the farm. I also can't help but think my awful thoughts about her belonging somewhere else contributed to us losing her. 
I can't stop thinking of her and keep reliving all the ""what ifs"" over and over in my head. She was only 8 months old.

In October I lost my Aunty, on my first day back at work learnt of one of my fighters committing suicide, heartbreakingly I had tried to call him earlier that day to check in given I had been away. Breaking the news to the rest of the gym was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. On what was meant to be his boxing debut, I had been busy getting the night organised
The one person I was truly looking forward to seeing was one of my best friends. She had been there for me in the weeks leading up, calling me to make sure I was okay, offering to come cook me food, just being her, full of love.

As the night kicked off, she¬†wasn‚Äôt there which wasn‚Äôt like her so I msgd her, a few hours passed and still no reply but my msg had been opened
2 days later, I‚Äôm debating whether to send her a msg or not, telling her how she‚Äôs upset me when I get a call from a friend, asking what happened to her, saying she saw a post on FB she had died.

My whole world crumbled, I remember falling to the floor and just crying, she¬†never showed to the fight night because she died that day.

The mystery of her death was made worse with people messaging me asking how it happened, telling me what they had heard, due to this I was having nightmares of these horror stories people had told I struggled to come to terms with her death, angry that one of my last thoughts about her was that I was annoyed.

On the day I viewed her body in her casket will forever be burnt into my memories, to physically see her, I still don‚Äôt have words for the emotions I felt. To kiss her forehead goodbye and to feel the cold under my lips it took what was left of my broken heart and shattered it into a million pieces. This was my first time seeing an open casket

It‚Äôs coming up to 6 months since her death and I still cry when someone mentions her name, For the first few months seeing someone who resembled her in the slightest way would send me into this panic, I couldn‚Äôt breath & for a second I would feel the absolute strength of the heart ache I was trying to suppress.

That heart ache is still very much present, I‚Äôm learning to slowly live with it, I still cry most days, now I just do it behind closed doors or into my pillow so no one can hear, because when your hurting you don‚Äôt want to hurt those around you.

If anyone was to ask me if I was okay, I would tell them I‚Äôm fine, but under the surface I am completely and totally soul shattering broken.

I lost my mum last April to cancer. She battled it on and off for 15 years but I still wasn‚Äôt prepared. I never thought it would actually take her. I feel like I‚Äôm coping less now than I was a year ago. I‚Äôve had to take time off work which makes me feel so guilty to try and regroup. I‚Äôve been to a psychologist before but I felt it didn‚Äôt help that much. I feel like I‚Äôve had to be so strong for my dad and now I can‚Äôt pretend any longer.
I take it out on my boyfriend all the time and I‚Äôm scared he will leave one day but I can‚Äôt help it even though I know it‚Äôs wrong.
I've been on medication previously but after trying 3 different ones I felt none of them worked for me.
I‚Äôm lost as to what the next step is

Hi all, I am new to this, this is my first post 
The last year for me I would say has been one of the toughest. A bit of background, my best mate last year tried to kill himself and I had no knowledge that he was feeling suicidal and depressed. This was one of the hardest things I have ever had to go through, the constant worrying afterwards that he would try again, I remember I would try and see him everyday and make sure he was alright. This was the biggest strain and I was so exhausted. Last year was also my senior year at high school and I just started university in March. Anyways, throughout last year things got bad between me and my friend, he would send me messages blaming me for stuff and just putting me down a lot of the time and this really affected me. Eventually about 6 months after he tried I told him i could not talk to him anymore until the school year was over as I couldn't handle it. I know that sounds terrible, it took me so long to make myself tell him this. Anyways, I am one who doesn't really like opening up to people and talking about how I am feeling and this is a real downfall. I never realized how much his attempt had hurt me, I felt so abandoned that he would leave me here, we were best friends and he would just leave me. This now, I have recently realized has scared me. I am so terrified of people leaving me now. Moreover, I used to have pretty bad anxiety quite a few years ago and it has been gone for many years but I can feel it coming back now. Whenever I get anxious I start playing with my necklace and that has been happening so often recently 
One of my friends, I first met them in December passed away 2 weeks ago. We were at uni together. This has had the biggest impact on my friendship group, in fact we have her celebration of life coming up in the next dew days. I held it together pretty well but I have my moments when it hits me like a truck and I feel so empty 
Last night I also found out that this time last year my best friend tried to kill himself and I had no clue 
Everything seems to be falling apart, everyone is leaving and it feels as if I am so alone. At the time he tried to kill himself he had so much going on and he has said that he has never felt the same way about life since that time. Now he cherishes it and loves life. But it still hurts so much and I am so scared that something is going to happen. If anything happened to him or anyone i know at this time i know it would destroy me 
Thanks for reading

HI.  I don't know what to say really. My last remaining family member just died and I'm so so alone. I can't get motivated to get up most days. I feel so alone at present. I have no friends to talk with. And no family. I feel it's just all to much to get up and function. I'm falling behind in everything and have lost all self value. I just want to find help but don't know where to turn. The loneliness is getting in the way of everything. Is there help in Sydney? ??

I'm feeling really lost at the moment. After googling and googling, it would appear that i'm the only person this has ever happened to (except I can't be - let's just say it's not a common 'thing').
I received a call from my half brother I've not spoken to in 30 years, 4 days ago. I figured my estranged father was ill and it was time to say the things that needed saying about the fact that he'd abandoned me repeatedly since I was 18 months old. But no, instead my brother told me that my father died 13 months ago. Yep - who does that??!!They'd left it just long enough for any claim on the estate to be difficult (not that i care about that). 
My last interaction with my father had been through his sister, my aunt, who'd 'found' me at 40-something (5-6 years ago). My father threatened her with family expulsion for having anything to do with me. Let me be really clear here, I did nothing to this man. I never lived with him, I never relied on/asked him for anything and yet he hated me. I think it was because I was a girl. He loved his sons.
Anyhoo, I had no opportunity for closure before his death. I'd hoped he'd see some kind of sense before he died and seek resolution or forgiveness or something in a letter. In fact, I'd been secretly holding out hope that we'd be reunited like an episode of Long Lost Family - lots of hugging and tears. But instead, I was completely forgotten - it was as if I didn't exist at all. Just a momentary afterthought more than a year later. It's confirmed my thinking that my grief doesn't matter, I just don't matter. Never did, still don't.
So I'm lost; nothing makes sense. The grief is weird. It's like it's all too late for any of it - there's no funeral to organise, lovely memories to think about or share, wakes to attend, ashes to spread. Just more torture from a family that like to do that to me at every possible juncture. Worst of all is the mourning for a little girl who lost her father and her right to a family a long time ago - but you don't mourn people who are still alive. I grieve what should and could have been. And all I've lost in the process. Not sure how anyone can do that to their child and why it's okay for them. Can anyone make my life make sense?

Hi all, I am 23 and I lost my big brother to suicide in September 2018. I watched him fight a downhill battle with mental illness for about 10 years. The effects of grief didn't really hit me until 3 months later, when something had triggered it.
I felt so sad, confused and disconnected from the world around me - I felt crazy. I started getting intrusive thoughts about a relationship I formed not long after his death. Ever since this occured, I am a lot more in my own head and more aware of my thoughts but there's moments where I can just enjoy the present like I used to. 
For these past few months I've also had light to mild tension in my head, stiff jaw and sore points in my neck and upper back. It feels as if my head is very foggy and I can't fully function.
I mainly wanted to share my story but also wanted to know if anyone else has had similar experiences to this?
Cheers!

My partners dad passed away from lung cancer about 6 weeks ago. He is not coping well nor am I. His parents are separated and he has 4 half siblings (all in their 40‚Äôs) and one full sibling, a he‚Äôs 24. My partner is the youngest at 21. My partner was the only child to be living with his dad and was there to see it all. 
5 weeks after his dad has died, his half siblings have started chasing him for ‚Äúrent‚Äù. They all own an equal share in the house but their dads wishes were for my partner to live there until he has fully qualified from his apprenticeship (in 14 months time). However this wish was onlY spoken of and not written down. 
He is not coping with this well and has since stopped talking to all his siblings and will occasionally take his anger out on me by snapping at me or being moody. My own mental health is not great at the moment as I had so much on my player, and still do. I had to deal with the loss myself, as well as helping my partner get through it and focusing on all the other aspects of my day to day life- new job, strict parents who‚Äôd don‚Äôt understand, and annoying little brothers. 
I am feeling so lost in myself. I have taken the day off work because I am struggling. My boyfriend has made a few mistakes (with regards to girls) throughout this relationship but has always apologised and said he will work on his actions. He hasn‚Äôt cheated but it‚Äôs small things which have hurt my feelings but I have given him the benefit of the doubt. I need an outsiders opinion on how to cope because my parents are of no help and we share the same friends.

Hi this is the first time I've ever done this.  I experienced a lot of grief and loss in the first year after my mum passed. special dates still trigger loss - my question for people - has anyone experienced any delayed anxiety symptoms after they started to feel like they were managing the grief stuff and getting on with life. It's not like I don't still miss my mum, I do every day. But I'm not emotionally crashing - however I am having bizarre symptoms like facial tingling, headaches and fatigue which I am being told is a delayed anxiety reaction to my anxiety/grief from last year?   Has anyone else been experienced this?

I thought I'd come on here to get some thoughts out. This will be a bit of a ramble of thoughts ha. My mum passed away in 2017 from breast cancer, I'm 29 so it feels quite young, quite a full on experience having her pass away at home but still better then other places. She was great fun, always making life a bit of adventure, always very supportive in some pretty rocky periods. I am happy that she crammed a lot into her life and all things considered she got 55+ years of good health. I am yet to see a grief counsellor as its a big line, alot of people have died ha, they look to need alot more pysch/counsellors there, still I have seen a pysch privately but I like this forum idea as its free hah. Good job Beyond Blue and everyone involved.

I have found that is extremely hard to cope with the loss of my mother. I get in my car to and from work each day and I feel like everything is so overwhelming. My mum was a lady who was very kind and lived for her children. 4 years ago we took her on a holiday to Cairns with my wife and Son, we had a great time. I lost my father 23 years ago but for some reason this seems so much harder to come to terms with. I think of all the lovely memories we have had with her and of my childhood it makes me happy that I have all those memories but at the same time it make me feel like I am so overwhelmed with grief..
People say in time it will be better as I am sure it will but when you had a mum who lived for her children the way she did and provided us with all that we needed and took us on family holidays interstate every summer. This was fantastic as it created life long memories I still treasure to this day and I am 52 years old.
My sister and I travelled over 20 years ago to Bali and at that stage we were told we were adopted as mum had to tell us as we were obtaining passports. We didn't care. as she was so good to us and it was never spoken about again.
My sister and Brother seem to be much stronger than me I seem to be so overwhelmed with her loss.
On occasion I have been quote upset at my desk, on a train last Friday whilst I was going into Melbourne. I was just thinking back to all the time my sister and I had taken the train into the city with mum and dad, its little things like that that set you off. Certainly with Christmas just around the corner it's also rather sad not having her with us..
My mum was 88 and a very active person who walked every day and caught public transport and got out of her huse each day to do something . That is until she had a bleed on her brain on the 17 March this year. She ended up in hospital for a little whil then on to a rehab place in Mornington. She could not move or do anything for herself since this happened. After Rehab we had to put her in high care nursing home until she passed away on the 26 Sept. 
In the 6 1/2 months after her stroke my sister and niece who is a nurse and my wife and I were all there 3 to 4 times a week. We would just sit with her in the room knowing that she did know we were there but couldn't really communicate but knew what was going on around her. And we would be there for meals on weekends so we could help feed her.. 
I miss her so much

Hi I‚Äôm new here...I guess I‚Äôm just not able to get over the amount of grief and heartache I‚Äôve experienced in the past 3.5 years. heres my story.
so I was expecting my first baby due July 21st 2015...my world seemed pretty perfect I had everything I ever could dream of. Then on the weekend of July 18th-20th 2015 my mum got unwell with a cold...on the 20th of July i had a conversation with her in the morning and I knew in my heart something was wrong. By lunch time she had become unconscious at home and by 7:40pm she was gone. I was highly devastated. She was my best friend. We would talk every day expect for Sunday‚Äôs because that‚Äôs when we went to go have family lunch with my parents and siblings. Life was never the same. Dad was completely heartbroken and pretty much died that night too.
3 months later in September he had an emergency operation due to bowel cancer and life was a constant battle for just under 3 years for him. It was always one thing after the other the cancer kept spreading and made him slowly deteriorate...last year at the start of July he ended up in palliative care and his body started shutting down. So for the last 3 nights of his life I would go and stay with him every night...the last night I knew something was wrong I was constantly msging my oldest sister who understands medical terminology but more so coz I knew he wasn‚Äôt right....eventually that night as I was waiting for my oldest sister to arrive I was pacing up and down outside his room and I heard my father take his last breath...I was sooo heartbroken. 
i just feel like life ha just thrown the biggest curve ball... although in the time I have had my 2 girls it‚Äôs such a struggle some days...I hate being a grumpy mum...I hate that we are also struggling financially! It just so much stress that keeps building up and I feel like one day I‚Äôm going to crack. I just don‚Äôt know how to get over this whole slump I‚Äôm in. 
My heart just feels so broken and so tired üòì

So today we; my friends and I, said goodbye to our friend, via a memorial service. He had killed himself in August 2017, but wasn't found until a week before Christmas just gone. 
His body still has not been released, hence why no official funeral. And not all his family was there either, due to fighting within the family. 
It was a lovely service ...... But how does one ever make sense of this type of death? 
I feel a mixture of relief that he's no longer struggling, and a deep unrelenting sadness at his departure. It's an all too painful reminder of just how difficult sobriety can be. 
Alcoholism: the subtle poison destroying people, one drink at a time.
Anyway, it's late now so I will sleep. Tomorrow is another day, and I am bridesmaid in a wedding on Saturday. Thanks for reading. Take care out there. And please remember; no problem lasts forever if you take a moment to reach out and share it with someone else. Please please, PLEASE reach out. Don't go it alone. I'm not. I got you lot! 
Nigh nigh. See you next time. Xox

I have lost a lot of people close to me from death and broken relationships. But I am now feeling such overwhelming loss after the death of my cat. It is just as heart breaking. I feel guilt that I had not recognised his illness earlier, maybe then he would be with me now. Instead he was euthanised. He went downhill rapidly but should have lived for many more years. He was my alarm clock, my welcome home and my constant companion. I am going through all the denial, bargaining and anger stuff. I have kept myself busy, I have talked to the few people that I am close to, I am already on anti-depressants but I feel like I have reached the limits of my ability to cope. It seems that life is full of loss until eventually we die ourselves. It also seems that there really is no help for depression and that mild depression is a constant state until some event brings it on full strength. Medication only filters out the worst of it. Counselling has never been helpful for me. I know I'm supposed to think positively and look toward the future and reach that acceptance stage eventually but sometimes life is just shit and there is not much you can do about it. I feel helpless, alone and so very, very sad.

Hi, i just signed up today as I did the depression test and scored very high. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety my whole life and having a husband who also suffers this doesn't help. Ill start from 2 years ago where i started to turn my life around, started exercising and losing weight and planning for a wedding and found out i was pregnant with baby no 3. 2 days before our wedding i lost the baby and spent the night in hospital as i lost a substantial amount of blood, this is when things turned again for the worst, l fell in a deep depression where i struggled to leave the house and couldn't be around pregnant women, later that year my mum was diagnosed with terminal cancer and i fell pregnant again so it was hard for me to be excited about the pregnancy because of my mum and i had alot of complications during the pregnancy so i was always on edge. Last year i had my beautiful boy and then 10 weeks later my mum past away from cancer (she didn't even get to meet my son she past away on her way to visit him). I struggle everyday with her not being here and blame myself for not being able to see her much as we live 12hr drive away. To make things worse i lost my grandfather a month after my mum (whom i was close to) my uncle has been diagnosed with brain cancer late last year and this year my husband has suffered a mild heart attack and was diagnosed with a tumor in his kidney which they had to remove.  At this stage the cancer hasn't spread but they will have to do 6month check ups to be sure. I have put on alot of weight and am really hating myself and dont really have anything to look forward to,  i live away from family and dont have many friends and feel incredibly alone all the time, and have no support here so im with my kids 24/7, my kids dont make me happy anymore and i cry almost everyday. My marriage is falling apart as we are always fighting mainly over money, im lost, i dont know what to do and dont know how to get out of it. I feel like im alone and no one understands what im going through probably why i cant make friends and i hide from socially gatherings with my kids school etc. Please help i cant live like this anymore.

My grandfather has been given just a little over a week to live - if that. 
We were never close and we never saw eye to eye. He wasn't the greatest of people. 
To be honest, I used to dread family events and having to be around him.. 
The reason I am writing is because I feel a deep sense of guilt that I don't feel sad at the prospect of him no longer being around. 
I feel like a terrible person that my only emotion is guilt and not sadness. He has lived a very privileged and successful life, he will also be out of pain.. 
Is it normal to feel almost nothing? I am worried by my response to this. I know there is no standard way of feeling and that everybody grieves differently, but the fact I feel no sadness makes me wonder what is wrong with me.

Hi, first time contact. I have suffered depression and anxiety and maybe PTSD for 27 years and I am 57, divorced, female and on my own. I was first diagnosed when pregnant first time. My husband was emotionally and sexually abusive. In the early years I attended a post natal depression group and was medicated, as this is what my GP suggested. I only used medication for a few years as it made me zombie-like. Now I reject any medication. Since then I have tried many counselors and psychologists and CBT . I am a Highly Sensitive person and an Introvert. So strangers and groups of unknown people are very daunting and exhausting. My children (boys) are grown and don't live close enough to have a close relationship with. Sometimes only see them at Christmas. We are in contact regularly by text messages, but they have their own lives to lead and difficulties to face. Because of my Introvertedness, I only have a couple of close friends and don't socialize at all in unfamiliar situations. I do work part time, have done at the same job for 5 years (I don't like change) and am part of a volunteer community group, but this involves very little socializing, only a monthly meeting.
 I describe my depression as ""overwhelming sadness"" and that I have lost my soul. 
I struggle to make myself achieve anything - even the dishes sometimes. My depression is parallelizing and debilitating. I am indecisive, a procrastinator and have no energy. I sometimes justify not doing anything by saying I am ""recharging my batteries"" or just ""having a quiet time"". And it only affects me and not bothers anyone else as I'm on my own. But, being on my own, I have jobs to do to maintain my property (that I can't afford to pay someone to do) and nothing is getting done because it all seems too big to handle. 
I have achieved in the past, I actually Owner Built my own house 18 months ago (finished after 3 years work) doing a lot of the work myself. 
I have been happiest in the past creating things - painting, sewing, woodwork. But I am struggling to get enthusiastic even about the creative things that will bring me happiness. I have always denied myself pleasure - I thought it was a mother thing, but now believe it is the long term depression. 
And now I am fearing I will never find love again either, because I am so damaged. I find it so hard just to start a new friendship. 
Thank you for reading my post. I look forward to comments and reading what others are struggling with on the site.

My husband of 16 yrs died from complications of cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer) on 24/12/19. Being a rare cancer, he tirelessly campaigned for recognition of rare cancers. He travelled to Canberra to have Parliament recognise this cancer and managed to get a few members to wear the ribbon and had Sen. Catryna Bylic speak about it in the House.
He was diagnosed August 2016 and had a Whipple procedure, 9 hrs of surgery where part of his pancreas, intestine and bowel removed to try and avoid the spread of cancer. Soon after 15 tumours were detected in his liver. He was tested for an immunotherapy trial but didnt meet the genetic requirements so opted for chemo. He coped pretty well with chemo for about 8 months eventually trimming down to 2 tumours. Those 2 continued to grow despite other chemo options. 
6 mths ago we moved to the country to enjoy the peace and tranquility he craved. During this time he spent many times being ambulanced to hospital due to high fevers, some of which couldnt be explained. I spent the last 5 mths driving to and from hospital, a 3hr round trip, to either visit him or bring him home. Once home he became increasingly dependant on me to the point where i had to help him dress and shower. Our oncologist never gave us a life expectancy and continued to look for a treatment and manage symptoms. Therefore, we both held hope and only occasionally allowed ourselves to believe this was terminal. It was one day at a time until the last appt with dr asked if he agreed to an advanced health directive, ie, do not ressucitate. I saw the light go out of his eyes. The next day was the best he had in months. Full of beans, lucid and hopeful. That afternoon he had a major stroke. One and a half days later he let go.
My problem is I cant stop thinking about how the cancer ate at him. I refused to see his decline as i kept hope. If he cried or got scared, i was the strong one. I have no regrets but cant stop mourning the man he was before cancer took hold. I never showed fear in his presence. 
Now i am a mess. Everyday seems worse as the reality sinks in that no, hes not in hospital waiting for me but Im never going to see him again! I have friends nearby who distract me but when im alone im so lonely and the house is so empty.
He was my 2nd husband. My 1st was a cruel man and i suffered ptsd from his abuse for many yrs.
My 2nd husband healed me by showing me what a real man does, and replaced my bad memories with pure joy.
Im just so lost!

Hi, I'm still in shock I think. In July my partner (only 46 years old) had some abdominal pain and a few days later we found out he had stage 4 terminal pancreatic cancer. He died painfully 8 weeks later. I can't sleep or eat and although I'm already on antidepressants for anxiety, my panic attacks are coming back. I have a 7 year old who I have to be strong for but I feel like I'm loosing it. I can't afford to take any time off work so even though he passed away two weeks ago, I have to just shut it all off. So I would love some advice about how to let go and grieve - but while still having to day to day things like school drop offs, work, after school activities etc. Thanks for listening :-)

Thrice in my life have I had to deal with suicide; Stacey was saved, Christie was lost, and Bobby found something worse: he's physically alive yet mentally catatonic. What signs did I miss? Where there words that did I not hear? Or behaviours I ignored. What could I have said or done to prevent them from believing there was no other choice?


I find it easier to deal with relationship breakdowns and stigma as those are issues I have direct and recent personal experience in, but their attempts at suicide are some of the ghosts that haunt me the worst.  I rarely speak of these as they are most painful when they return to active memory. Even Stacey's, I can still see her on the floor.

Why is this so hard to write about? 
(please bear with me, this is going to take a few day or so to get out)

Please bare with me on this difficult of all topics.
If someone has never parachuted, how can they describe the event to someone that has never jumped? A soldier in war describing it...painting the picture? 
We all have various experiences that define us as unique. So when it comes to losing a child parents often describe it as ""indescribable"". How can they paint that picture?
Most of us have experienced grief, the loss of a loved one but to lose a child is, it seems, on a higher plain.
As I've worked with victims of crime one challenge has been to find ways of obtaining relief from such grief. We as humans cant possibly compare grieving circumstances of such loss except that anger would rate as an added emotion with some. Anger at a perpetrator or someone seemingly or directly responsible can envelop a parent creating unimaginable intetnal anguish. 
Getting a life back following such loss is often most difficult. The first rule of thumb is to have no rules. No expectations. Gentle ears, calm, waiting for that one signal that is positive towards moving forward with day to day activity.
There are ways to lose a child other than death. I've lost a neice to a cult. At 14yo she ran away from blood family. She's now 33yo, has children of her own and is estranged from most blood family still.  Imagine the hurt the parents and 5 siblings feel? Their child still lives but near zero chance of reconciling. ..is also a unique form of grief. How empty?
Ive found there is not any ""best practice"" to move forward and pick up pieces of ones life to become productive following the loss of a child. One way to help is devoting ones life towards helping others in the name and honour of their child. A cause.
Memorials are common. Honouring your child's life by deeds, in a way allowing your childs life to result in a positive project of some sort of your choice doesn't have to be public if you prefer it to remain private. Grief can be very private or maybe public especially if fundraising.
My good neighbours son passed away in a car accident. Days later his daughter in law had items owned by his son to collect. Amongst them were 50 potted rose plants his son prepared. His son adored roses. He took them home, planted them in a special garden, takes cuttings and pots them for others in town. He never takes one cent. 
This small hamlet in spring is adorned with his sons roses. Wow!
Most of us cant relate to losing a child. We can find a way of their memory to live on.

My beautiful son suicided on the twelfth of May 2015, he was twenty four years old.  I struggle day in and day out to stay here on this planet which I call hell.  This morning I found myself crying for no reason, I haven't cried for a while but it just hit me this morning.  I rang my mother because I just needed to talk about anything really but she rushed me off the phone even after I had told her how I was feeling.  I have no one.  I live alone and I have no one.  I struggle to see a point in keeping on going.  I have a bone disease which causes me to break bones very easily, I currently have a broken hand and shoulder and I am so sick of pain.  Physical pain every day is depressing me on top of the grief I am dealing with. I honestly do not know what to do or who to turn to.

So I've scoured the web for answers on why I can't shake this feeling, most pages say it's normal to feel this way but I've now felt true heartbreak so bad I feel like someone's hit me in the chest. 
We had two dogs. Our older family dog passed away a couple of years ago, he lived a wonderful, long life. Our younger dog has always been pretty stubborn and demanding, so when we introduced a new puppy just before my 21st birthday last year, they didn't get on. Mum and dad couldn't deal with it, the two dogs fought more and more frequently and it was dangerous and unfair for everyone - especially the dogs. Mum and dad came so close to surrendering our new puppy two or three times before it actually happened. Dad got between them and he was bitten on the leg, it wasn't really major but it was clear to us all that we couldn't keep this going the way it was. I moved out of home again and then mum seriously broke her arm. To prevent anymore fighting or injuries, mum and dad surrendered the puppy to the RSPCA. At 8am on my 22nd birthday the RSPCA came and picked up my best friend. I'm unable to know who adopted him and I find myself looking out for him when I see a black and white dog. 
I feel as though I've lost a part of me... a gorgeous, playful and intelligent little part of me. It's been more than 6 months now and I feel exactly the same way as I did back then. I can't shake it. I've noticeably developed this ridiculous anxiety since then and don't know if I'll ever move through this. I've lost family and friends before and been able to come to terms with it; I'm just unable to comprehend that someone I've never met is out there with my puppy. On top of that, I've convinced myself that it's ridiculous that I even feel this way. 
Please share an opinion, story, advice. I don't know what to do with myself.

Hi. I'm new here. Not really sure where to begin ........ I joined here for a few reasons. One is because I'm sick of Facebook and the 'same old same old' stuff that gets around on there .... I'd rather something a bit more 'real', you know? 
But I've also joined here because recently I've experienced the loss of yet another friend through suicide. And sometimes, I feel as though I'm getting too 'used to it'. this is probably now about the 10th person I know to die from suicide. But then, there are other times too when the wave of grief and shock is so overwhelming that I can barely breathe ....... 
Anyway, that's my story at the moment. Sorry if it's full on. Today was a pretty good day, but I'm also mindful of the funeral that is yet to come.

About 18 months ago I lost my father to bowel cancer. Watching him die was the most horrific experience of my life. He went very downhill and died within a few weeks, after living with the disease for several years. He was devastated, terrified and unprepared. In hospital during the final days he would cry in pain and ask where he was going when he became delirious. He turned yellow and didn‚Äôt recognise me. My father remarried an awful woman 35 years younger than him and while he was ill she demanded he leave her everything in his Will, otherwise she would divorce him and take his infant daughter back to the Philippines. So me and my disabled sister had to go through a terrible legal battle after he died, just to receive a very small portion of what we were entitled to. There was really only the house left, she had drained all his savings and superannuation while he was ill. 
All the while my boyfriend at the time was a very emotionally detached and distant person, he tried to be there for me, but often that comprised of saying nothing and staring at me blankly. It made me feel so misunderstood and alone. A few months afterwards we broke up. I didn‚Äôt want to, I really loved him, but I just felt so unbearable sad and sick with grief and I knew he was just making me feel worse with his emotional detachment. I thought things would just disintegrate and become horrible if I didn‚Äôt end things amicably. He didn‚Äôt put up a fight.
I think for the past year I have shut everything out, I have developed problems with alcohol and motivation, many mornings I‚Äôd wake up covered in bruises with no recollection of the night before. Twice I concussed myself by blacking out while drunk. I‚Äôve worked extremely hard seeing a psychologist to overcome the grief and poor coping, and I‚Äôve finally started feeling a bit more normal again. 
I miss my ex boyfriend so much and regret our breakup. Recently he spent a night cuddling me and holding my hand in his bed after a night out with friends (he wasn‚Äôt drunk) then he turned around and said it meant nothing to him and he has no feelings for me. It just broke my heart and now I feel back at square one, even worse than ever now. I don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôd hurt and humiliate me like that, even after we broke up we stayed close friends and he said he loved me. It‚Äôs so hurtful and I feel like my life has become unbearable. He knows how hard everything has been for me and I just don‚Äôt understand how my life has ended up so horribly.

It's been a over a year since my mum died of cancer. I was her primary carer for 2 years, doing all I could to help her recover. Now I'm still crippled with anxiety and depression, living in her house which we shared. I'm 60 yrs old. Finding it almost impossible to forge a new life. Meds and therapy have proved useless. All I can try and do is eat healthy, a little exercise and sleep when I can to forget the nightmare she is gone. I know I need to get out more, but the apathy and lack of enthusiasm in anything is overwhelming.

Hi all,
           In 1994, I was widowed when my then wife had breast cancer. 6 mths later my then girlfriend found out that my 6yo daughter had been molested by a friend of my late wife who was living with us. For at least 3 mths after, I experienced what I call Emotional Tsunamis; experiencing an interchanging wide range of emotions on a daily basis (at extreme levels). I never had any counselling as it wasn't available in my town or area back then, although I wrote heaps of poetry and later music to try and release pent up emotions. Though I happily remarried in 1997 (still going strong), to this day, I get easily irritated by things or situations not going right, or not working. With people I am fine and couldn't be more patient and accepting.

Is this irritation (and it can cause me to complain, curse and sometimes swear) a hangover from 1994? How do I deal with it as it sometimes irritates those around me?

Just over a year ago my fianc√© took his life after a silent battle with depression. Neither me nor my daughter ever saw that he wasn't okay and never expected him to do something like this. Since then his family and friends have refused to talk to me or my daughter and blame me for his death. My partner, daughter and myself spent over three years living just down the road from his family which was an absolute disaster as they did not accept nor like me and my daughter. My daughter and I spent family dinners being glared at and ignored but eventually the three of us moved to a new house. Just two months later he did this. My daughter and I have been forced to move to a new state as I have been verbally attacked at my local shopping centre and home. This has left me depressed, lonely and sad. I struggle to do everyday tasks as one minute I am fine the next I am angry then sad. I spend countless hours asking myself why and how did I not see this.

When I was a child I used to cry into my pillow wailing that I was so alone. I was always told I was dramatic as I had a large family. After years of denial I now understand why I felt that way.

But I haven‚Äôt, they‚Äôve never been there. I‚Äôm not sure how to except that the expectations I have of needing my parents to be the parents I‚Äôve always  needed.

Hi everyone,
Christmas can be a really wonderful time of the year but it can also be a really difficult time of the year.  I thought I'd create this post to talk about ways to cope or even just acknowledge some of that pain you might be feeling over Christmas and the new years.
For me personally, it feels heavy - I think there's a part of my brain that's like ""oh they aren't here today"" before it hits me, or conversations that used to be light become harder and heavier.  I think it also brings up a lot of sad memories not just joyful ones, as a lot of Christmas's for me were hospital visits which is not something anyone wants to experience.
So here's a couple of things I've come up with - maybe you can add to the thread if you like about how you cope or what makes things easier?
If you are struggling know that we are here for you and the forums and the support lines will be open all over the Christmas break.
- It's okay to say no and not do all the things.  
- It's okay to let go or create new traditions, or to keep the ones that you have.
- It's okay to take time to think about your loved one.  Maybe you want to go to the cemetery, look through photos, leave an empty chair at the table, make their favourite dish, write letters to them, donate to a charity, light a candle or even just talk about it.
- It's okay to not give gifts, or to give different gifts.  I do a lot of my shopping online which makes things a little less overwhelming.
- It's okay to take time for yourself.  
- It's okay to cry.  Or scream. Or talk about it.
- It's okay to ask for help.
- It's okay to laugh or have a nice time.  We're allowed to do that and not feel guilty about it.
The biggest thing that's going to help me over Christmas and new years is to be kind to myself and give myself permission - and somehow I think that might help you too.  We don't owe anyone anything.  We're allowed to hurt and cry and feel like the Grinch (or maybe that's just me!..).  But we're also not alone.

I‚Äôm finding things especially hard this year. I‚Äôm supporting my fianc√© after the last 3 mental breakdowns with 2 hospitalisations within the last year. I am feeling so low that I‚Äôm running on empty. I spend the little hours I have when I‚Äôm not working finding ways to help and support my partner. Most research tells me that I need to look after myself however it‚Äôs easy to say this when you aren‚Äôt constantly worrying. My partner has been constantly mentally unwell for over a year now and have no peace. He is my soulmate, I will not walk away because I love and cherish him. I understand he is not well causing his constant I‚Äôll state of mind and downward spiral. Im doing all I can to keep him alive or medication, healthy diet. He has tried ECT numerous phycotherapy, recently a failed drug trial which sent him into psychosis.. got worse from there. He doesn‚Äôt take alcohol or illegal substances and never has. Why him?!
My dads death anniversary is New Year‚Äôs Eve. This time of year cuts me deeply and feel so sad and low,  hurts that I can‚Äôt just be sad around him. I know he can‚Äôt take it when I am low. What can I do besides hold it in?

Hello first time writing in a forum üëãüèº
I recently started seeing a psychologist for helping cope with the loss of my brother passing away. I had been avoiding my feeling completely for 2 years and it resulted in my partner of 10 years breaking up with me for being too sad 
I have been to 8 therapy sessions and my psychologist has suggested i might benefit from anti depressants. I‚Äôm unsure about this as I don‚Äôt have any experience or know anyone who has been this type of medication. I don‚Äôt really like taking medication in general. 
I want to feel better but since opening up in the sessions I find I cry all the time. In general I feel completely hopeless about my life now and have so many negative self thoughts that I really struggle to make go away. 
I dont really know what I‚Äôm after with posting this, just I guess if antidepressants help with these problems
thanks for reading

Hi guys,
As you guys can tell I'm new here. I have difficulties reaching out in real life. I've had Depression since I was 12 years old, and anxiety hit me hard when I was 21 until present. Things just really started falling apart for me after my father's death in 2012. Sadly, I've had many counsellors and Psychologists during my teenage and young adult years but I could never really communicate well face to face. I know I need some kind of help and support, but I'm always so stubborn and in denial. 
I feel like I'm just strapped down and chained to the floor, inside of a locked cage. I find it difficult to keep swimming in this huge ocean called life. There's so much going on in my life that I literally feel like curling into a ball in bed and going to sleep for good.
I don't know who to reach out to, I live with my mum but I don't want her to stress and worry about my issues while she has medical problems herself. I have a boyfriend, but my whole relationship is just very complicated and hard to explain. I have no friends, due to my anxiety. I do work but since quitting my last job and moving on to my current job now, my salary has been a complete flop. I have about $8.5k in credit that I desperately need to pay off, but can't because my job sucks. I have missed calls and emails from credit companies and property agents about overdue payments that are going over my head and I am living each fortnight with just barely enough money left over for petrol and cigarettes. 
I'm drowning and even with the support of my family, I feel like the dark shadow that has been with me for years will end up being the thing that drags me down until the end. 
I don't want to burden anyone but I just need a sense of direction in my life. I want to take control of myself and be able to not feel like I'm miserable each day. I really need help. 
Thank you.

My dad took his own life two weeks ago.  There was no warning.  He always seemed happy.  No one I've spoken to had any insight that this would happen.  It has shaken me to my core.  I keep asking him why but get no answer.  My uncle (his brother) also took his own life 10 years ago, and I've learned their father was also a recluse who basically drank himself to death.  I can feel depression pulling at me.  On top of being unable to believe my dad is gone, and how he did it, I am also thinking that I will be next.  Clearly, it runs in the males in the family.  This scares me so bad.  Having daily anxiety attacks.  Scared of where this will all lead, but not showing anyone to be strong for the family.  Just can't believe this is happening.  It's like a nightmare I want to wake up from.

I lost my grandfather this year he was my best friend, hasn't been any easier since the day he left me. He raised me since I was 2 weeks old him and my aunty (my dads sister) but she past away when I was 11, I grew up with her always travelling away for operations because she had cancer... my pop lived 5 years after her now im left feeling alone - my brother is pretty messed up he used to bash our mum even when she was sick after chemotherapy and I was to little I couldn't help it, I resent him but my mum told me to forgive him before she passed away - uhhh ive tried to but its hard, my brother is locked up in jail at the moment thank god because he was on heavy drugs, I guess that his only way of coping with it all - he didn't even make our grandfathers funeral because he was in jail, I spoke to him on the phone it was hard out opf all people I thought he could of been the only person that would understand what im going through since pop helped raise the both of us since we were babies.
 
Man grief is hard to cope with its my first time opening up but typing makes it easier than talking to someone for me; I just hope everyone that is grieving can find the help they need on these online forums - that's what I'm going to try and do.
 
Feel free to share your story with me; I'd love to hear and help if I can.

My partner and i have only been together for 9 months, but we have known each other and been bestfriends for 10 years. 
We have been trying for a baby for about 5-6 months now. And i have had 2 miscarriages.
its so horrible. The first time i had to point to a pregnancy test to tell my partner. Naturally first he asked if i was pregnant, i shook my head than he asked ""your not"" all i replied with was ""anymore"". And the second time was a month ago and i only told him 2 days ago. 
The physical pain is the worst pain, but the emotional pain... its hard to explain, you feel as if you have lost part of yourself, like someone has taken one of your traits or characteristics and a piece of your heart aswell. 
Its been really hard recovering as the first one i didnt have any time off of work and the second one i had a single day off of work because i was further along and the pain was too much to bare. And since then i havent had a day off of work, i have movdd house, done almost all if the unpacking and moving around the furniture, and doing every last one of the house chores without any help. This is all on top of working 6 days a week. 
im exhausted both mentally and physically, i just wish that it had never happened because it plays on my mind all the time, seeing babies breaks my heart at the moment because its all i want. And it doesnt help i struggle to admit it to my partner so i bottle it up. And its hard to talk to anyone about it...

My beautiful 2 year old cat was attacked by the neighbours dog 2 weeks ago and despite surgery and 2 days of extraordinary treatment she died. I am totally devastated. I got her and another cat from the RSPCA and they were my babies. I tried to keep them inside but she insisted on going outside and would often dash out the door when anyone opened it so I made them indoor/outdoor cats and they were perfectly happy. They would run along the top of the fence and I can only guess that the dog barked at her and scared her and she lost her footing and fell off the fence into their yard. I have so much guilt and ""if only"" thoughts that run through my head. My other cat is grieving the loss of his companion and I have not been able to let him outside since as I am afraid the same thing will happen to him. I am getting a cat enclosure built in my yard so that he can have some outside time, not ideal but better than nothing. The initial grief and shock has passed but I feel it come over me in waves at unexpected times and it takes my breath away. The image of her after she was attacked is forever lodged in my head and upsets me enormously. I am finding it hard coming up to Christmas. I don't want to do anything and take no joy in any activity. I feel like I am just moving through the motions of living without actually living.

Hello everyone. 
I struggle with being alive and having a great family of my own, wich may seem strange but i am left  wondering why i have what i have? 
I have lost 5 Brothers. 3 to suicide and 2 to illness and not one day  goes by without me thinking that i am to blame in someway.
Is it normal to feel guilt just for being alive?

Good afternoon,
Not sure where to turn so thought I‚Äôd post on here.  Got a phone call on Monday night to say that my best friend from high school had passed away and that they believe it‚Äôs suicide (he left a note and his housemates found him when they got home from work).  He lives interstate but we still kept in pretty close contact.  He‚Äôd seemed pretty quiet over the last few months but I assumed it was just because he was busy with work, and sometimes he‚Äôd do volunteer work overseas. Otherwise he seemed perfectly himself and I genuinely thought he was ok.
I definitely feel like i could‚Äôve done more to help, and if not then I just think I must‚Äôve been a really terrible friend.  He was a trusted friend, a massive support to me during some dark times and also just so much fun to hang out with. He was the first person I came out as gay to (I‚Äôm from a strict fundamentalist Christian family and so for me to trust him with that was a really big thing for me).  
It feels selfish for saying this but I honestly don‚Äôt know how to deal with how I‚Äôm feeling about this.  I‚Äôm struggling to concentrate on anything, sometimes I‚Äôm quite teary and other times I just feel nothing at all.  I‚Äôm struggling to sleep and I honestly just feel like a massive part of my life is permanently changed.
I don‚Äôt feel like I have anyone left to talk to about this.  The only person I‚Äôm regularly in contact with is a guy at the gym who I workout with, and while I feel like I could trust him with telling him I also don‚Äôt want to be a burden on anyone, and it also feels like a weird place to being up this topic.
Anyway thanks for reading this, not sure anything can be done but I appreciate it.

hi, just registered on this forum, so please go easy on me!
I had a stillbirth 5 years ago and to this day it still haunts me. I feel like I am a failed mum for not being able to give my son a life properly. I do have a living daughter, now 9 years old, who is a huge part of my life. her father ( now my ex, for numerous amount of reasons I won't elaborate right now) thinks I am still ""whinging about it"" and I should just get over it, stop moping around over something that happened 5 years ago.
is there a ""timeframe"" of some sort for grieving, or being depressed? I used to see a psychologist right after the stillbirth but I felt greatly uncomfortable being in her office. seeing a ""f__g shrink"" apparently should have fixed me not made me feel worse as a mother, my ex said back in the day. not sure why I remember what he uttered all that time ago as I don't live with him anymore and only talk when absolutely needed (he is in QLD I am in WA with my daughter) but upon browsing disability employment services, I thought, ""is depression considered as a disability? oh speaking of which... yeah apparently there's a timeframe for being depressed""
my apologies if I am rumbling. it has been years but it is not an easy thing to get over.
should people just ""get over"" grief after a certain amount of time or is there no such thing?

Hi everyone
My mum (56yo) died suddenly 3 weeks ago. She was extremely depressed, and took her own life. 
She‚Äôd had a breakdown and been diagnosed 2 years earlier, which quickly led to her first attempt on her life. Myself and my two brothers (ages 25-31) found her (after a long search) very close to dying. Other family were involved too. 
Over the following year or so she spent a lot of time in psychiatric wards, had ECT, had numerous medication changes. We attended various mental health meetings with her and her team.
She began a pattern of recovering, return to her own home, stop taking her pills, becoming unwell again, and disappearing. We‚Äôd find out she was missing, go looking for her, and find her near death after another attempt at taking her life.
this happened 4-5 times
Finally she returned home after some more ECT and seemed to have improved. She was still very flat in mood, and couldn‚Äôt seem to get motivated for anything, even her old hobbies. But she returned to work part-time, which had been a very important step for her in her recovery, and we were all hopeful she was finally recovering for good. We tried to get her involved in social groups and hobbies, would take her out for dinners and nice events. She seemed to be on the mend. 
Until 3 weeks ago. We had no warning, none of us noticed she was getting worse. A welfare check was done when she didn‚Äôt go to work. 
She was found dead at home, having taken her own life. Without going into detail, it is certain that she planned this very carefully to ensure it would happen. 
Obviously, her family is devastated. We loved her and we had all tried so hard to get her well. 
In the the immediate aftermath, we were in shock. My family is very supportive and close, so we have all been there for each other as the grief set in, as her children (including me) planned her funeral, had her last viewing, and said goodbye. 
As time goes on, I still find myself  crying at unexpected times, especially at night. My partner has been VERY supportive but I feel guilty for my sudden tears.
Also, Im having panic attacks- over me and my partners life insurance, over my fear other loved ones might die, over if my mum suffered at the end, and even over where her spirit/ soul is now (I‚Äôm not religious).
my worst panic attacks are over her personal possessions i have inherited. I‚Äôm terrified of them getting damaged or lost, as they are all I have left of my mum.
ive booked a counsellor, but wanted to post here. Thankyou

I lost a friend/co-worker suddenly last night although sudden not entirely unexpected. I feel like I don't know what to do, I've had this feeling with grief before and I know it's only early in the grief process. I was feeling down before but now I feel even more down, like everything is pointless now. We were friends but not super close friends and I feel like I shouldn't be or don't have the right to be feeling such strong grief over her death. I feel like if I wasn't depressed, my grief would be more proportional. I actually feel embarrassed to feel so overwhelmingly sad.
Does anyone know any tips on dealing with grief exacerbated by depression?

Hello everyone,
I have been getting told by my close friends that I need to begin some sort of counseling and support since the tragedy i experienced in October. My mother had cancer (originally vulva cancer), which was successfully removed with minor difficulties. Things were on the mend for about 16 months until last October when I received the dreaded phone call from my brother who was under the impression that it was serious but not dire, when he told me that I need to make arrangements and travel interstate to say goodbye to our mum.
The cancer had resurfaced in her pancreas and in under 20 days it spread to her liver and dispersed into her blood stream. By the time i arrived at her side she had under two hours left of her life. I was immediately spoken to regarding the prospect of euthanasia (which i understood was illegal )? However when my personal analysis of the entire situation was complete i could see why that horrible topic was brought up?
I don't know what part exactly has disturbed me the most? The confrontation of crying relatives and sad combined energy, the state of her¬†? or the shock of seeing my mum try to communicate with me in short 10 second intervals before the medication took over her cognitive functionality, she looked like a¬†hippie (I'll never forget her eyes)! I would not wish it upon anyone.
That night after she died i sat with my siblings while they engaged in the ""blame game"" fuled by unresolved conflict and alcohol and that numbing benediction of unnecessary drama never gets any less tedious. I sat there in shock, complete disbelief, that visceral raw emotional pain that I refuse to expel in front of most people.
Being the first born in my family i felt it was paramount that I allow everyone else to break down around me while I jumped into a more caretaker type role. Subconscious denial can be a powerful coping mechanism i guess? I felt every burning emotional sub set listed in fact i even felt others that are a little too dark for any list of symptoms associated with death.
almost two months on and i am unsure what stage I'm in now? I'm not eating, sleeping nor taking appropriate steps for recovery. In a way it's like i chose euthanasia for myself? Secret permission to leave this nightmare. In silence with my demons.
Jay

I need help and advice, please. 
I am a 25 year old woman who has dealt with anxiety, depression and and panic disorder since puberty. 
I am yet to find treatment that works for me, though I am yet to give up. I have found several roadblocks in terms of costs and waiting lists. For as long as I can remember I have found it increasingly more difficult to go to work (and as a child, school) I find myself having panic attacks the night before or the morning of a shift. I have begun to wonder if this is a form of agoraphobia, as any activity where I feel that I cannot immediately leave if I want to, seems to trigger this for me. 
I have fought through this for so long, with it increasingly becoming more difficult. Most of the time I can force myself to do what I need to do despite the nausea and racing heart and general feeling of needing to run far away. But for the last year or so it has had such a hold on me, causing me to miss alot of work and lose a job. 
I decided to study for 12 months instead of working, but the same panic affected me in the same way when it came to placement - and it once again beat me, I'm now forced to withdraw because I was unable to complete the placement.
This has left me feeling suicidal more than once, feeling as though I'll never be a functioning person, though I never act on it because I couldn't hurt my loved ones in that way. 
I refused to sink this time, and picked myself up almost immediately and threw myself into jobs interviews and casual work before securing a full time position.
Three days before I was due to start this job my mother very suddenly and unexpectedly passed away. I was with her and performed cpr on her until the paramedics arrived, they were unable to revive her. 
I did well at first, I kept myself busy, planning the funeral and staying strong for those around me - not wanting them to worry about me. 
But now I just feel hopeless. I took a month off and went to work for a couple of weeks before I got injured and then sick, causing me to miss the past week and dread going back. 
I feel that everything is just too hard, how do I deal with these issues as well as dealing with the loss of my mother simultaneously. I am exhausted, I have been exhausted for so long and now I just feel I have nothing left. 
All of my friends and family have been wonderful, but it's true that everyone begins to disappear after a few weeks. I feel I'm just a burden to them now. 
Please help.

Hi everyone
I'm here because I lost my sister to suicide 5 months ago and I'm not coping. I feel anxious, on the verge of tears all the time, hopeless, irritable and unsure of myself. My partner, family and friends are supportive but I don't want them to worry too much or overload them. I feel like my whole life is pointless even though objectively I know it's not. I'm seeing a counsellor periodically and reading a lot of books. I have a strong desire to change my job and location, but I'm not sure if now is a good time to be doing that. However my job seems intolerable now and I hate going there. I don't know what to do as I'm scared of feeling so hopeless.
Thank you for any help you can give me.

its amazing how time flies and you dont even notice. i have tried to move forward but it still plays on my mind every day. its almost 25 years since my dad died from suicide. i was 10 years old but it still feels like yesterday, i still remember seeing him walking along the side of the road and me on the school bus watching him as it drove away. i knew something wasnt right i had this sense that it wasnt but did nothing. when i got home i found out what happened then it hit me like a tonne of bricks, i could of stopped this i could of been there and he wouldnt of done it. even now i still hate myself and i hate him, i hate him for doing this to me making me feel like this but i still also love him. its hard to figure out how to feel, its tough i cried when i was a kid but now its hard, its hard to be emotional about it as due to length since occurring but i see these people older then me who have there dads still and i feel this tug at my heart of loneliness. i dont have anyone to talk to, to discuss male issues have that father son chat about life. i visited his grave site recently and it was tough cause what do you say a plaque, is he listening, does he understand that the effect this has had on me growing up and still has an effect on my life now. hardest thing i have found is letting go and accepting that he has gone and that i could of done something.

Hi
 
Ive recently had to advise my partner his father has passed away unexpectedly and have been supporting him and mother in law during this process. Mother in law has health issues and requires 24/7 support as her husband was also main carer. Since father inlaw passing mother in law has been stating she is free and can do what she wants now. Doesn't have a care in the world and doesn't care that people are putting there lives on hold and trying to assist her to ensure she is cared for as much as possible.
 
I suffer with Depression and Anxiety and yesterday she kept having a go at me and blaming me for things that I had not done. I know that this is her health concern but she is also being spiteful. 

I am now struggling with my daily routines and feel terrible as I couldn't remain strong for my partner. 

I need help and don't know where to turn.

My boyfriend committed suicide 3 weeks ago. The pain, loss, guilt, loneliness, isolation from this grief is unbearable. Let alone having to come to terms that I'm all alone again. 45 single no kids and broken. He has left a big hole in my life and atm I don't even want to wake up in the morning and process that he's gone all over.  I'm broken over the fact that i didn't get to say the things I should have. I didn't get to tell him that i loved him recently because I was frustrated and dragged down by his depression. Yes I am getting grief counseling and I feel that every body else closely affected has a partner or family to spend their nights with. He was my companion and now I'm all alone.

Hi there peeps. 
Ive written on here a number of times so I thought I‚Äôd put down some of my thoughts and possibly someone can tell me what is what. 
2014 rolled around. Wife and I had found a better place. Life was ok. I had some stressors in my life. A failing family business, a struggling marriage and worry about a diagnosis after a check up (year and half before that I was in correctly diagnosed with liver cancer at 40). Hence the worry. All was fine. 2 weeks after that I started to feel more anxious and started questioning certain ailments and feelings that I had. Could it be cancer? As I started to spiral into anxiety, depression kicked in too. Before you know I severely anxious and very depressed. I was so scared I always needed reassurance on a constant basis. That went on for almost a year. My psych told me it was trauma but If I look back on I now I didnt have flashbacks, I didn‚Äôt have nightmares and I didn‚Äôt think about it. I was just overly anxious desperate and depressed. I knew it would effect my marriage and surely enough my wife left almost exactly a year after my mental illness hit me. 
For the next 3 years I begged, pleaded, got angry, gave her space, push it out of my mind, become obsessed, begged, pleaded. Yet I knew her coming back wouldn‚Äôt make me feel better whatsoever. My stupid psych said it will take time. It will get better. What he didn‚Äôt understand was my mood disorder. I felt horrible. Sure there were periods where I felt ok but it would always comeback. I wanted her so badly. In reality I needed her. I was sad that she was gone yet I couldn‚Äôt make myself better. It‚Äôs now been over 3 years since she left and over 4 years since my anxiety and depression hit. I know it‚Äôs not gone as I still fight it everyday yet and I‚Äôve thankfully changed psychiatrists. 
These are what are going through my head;
rumination, deep sadness, anxiety, loneliness, useless, no self esteem, unlovable, feel like a failure, no enthusiasm for life, deep despair about my past with my relationship, no hope, feelings of a lost life, guilt, longing for the past (not her but our relationship, fear of the future, scared, memories of the relationship, not good enough, grief, deep loss, hopelessness.
i can‚Äôt keep living like this and I feel like life is leaving me behind. I cannot see a future or a present and I‚Äôm sick and tired of it. 
Are those attributes are apart of depression and grief?

Hi all,
26 year old male, severe depression, anxiety and regular panic attacks.
¬†
This is the first time I've public posted my thoughts so bear with me.
¬†
I suffered from mild depression and anxiety from my early teens, up until November 2014 when my eldest brother passed away in a car accident at aged 32
following that in 2016 my mother passed away aged 52 from a stroke whilst shopping with my youngest sister who was only 11 at the time.
And again following that, in September 2017 my other brother just 3 years older than myself at 29 years of age passed away in his sleep from pneumonia and an enlarged heart (undiagnosed).
¬†
Since my eldest brother passed away, my depression, anxiety and stress has been unimaginably through the roof, with it only getting worse after each death.
¬†
My last brother to pass away was considered my best friend so it was a ""double whammy"" and i took a month of work from my new job which i only started 7 weeks prior.
¬†
I feel lost, alone and my social anxiety stops me from doing the most basic of tasks, such as calling someone, getting up to go to the shops, etc...
¬†
I came here because I keep having time off work and cant keep it up as my financial situation doesnt allow it, I can no longer do things I enjoy like working on my project car, as I dont have any money to fund it, which make me more depressed and it just keep going around in circles.
¬†
I am currently medicated and have just started taking something to help me sleep (California rockey fuel apparently).
¬†
I was previously on another medication for 4 years, but it didn't work for when my family passed away.
¬†
I cant speak to my partner, friends or family because they get upset when Im upset.
¬†
I bottle my emotions up a lot and I cant help doing it, its just how I am, I've been seeing a physiologist each fortnight for the past 9 months, i feel good after i go but i go back to feeling the same the next day.
¬†
I cant afford more time off work as I am the sole income earner and I currently have a childcare bill in excess off $500 not to mention car regos due, so that stresses me out more.
¬†
What should I do? Please help.

I lost my beautiful husband 6 months to suicide and I‚Äôm so lost and lonely. He was my soul mate the love of my life and now his gone. His family have placed the blame on me and have said some very horrible and nasty things about me it‚Äôis pushing me over the edge and I‚Äôm felling more and more like I want to go with my husband. My husband had suffered from depression and alcoholism due to a very traumatic childhood and he would not seek the proper help he need he would always say I‚Äôm ok Baby. We loved and adored each other and to think people are saying my husband didn‚Äôt love me is breaking my heart üíî. I don‚Äôt know how to go on anymore I have been in hospital twice since his death. IS IT MY FAULT MY HUSBAND DID THIS? I need help to understand why his family blame me so harshly I loved them. We had a fight the night before due to his drinking and not working for over 2 years things were getting really hard financially as I was the only one working this got so bad we had to start selling our personal belongings and were going to be evicted from our rental house I should have kept my mouth shut and never said anything to him I live every day blaming myself and than to also have others blame is just to much. Even though we had our ups and downs like all couples do we never stopped loving each other I just want my husband home with me.

Hi all
this Thursday marks the 10 year anniversary since my Mum died. She was 63 and had melanoma. My family are all in UK. I went home to help nurse her and spent six weeks away all up.

...I have this constant feeling like I‚Äôm just waiting for another terrible thing to happen. My gran died of brain cancer. Then my bf died of brain cancer two years later. Then my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer. 
I now live in an almost constant state of paralysis. Like I‚Äôm just unable to step forward because I feel like something else terrible will happen. I don‚Äôt know how to not feel this way... when every time people have said ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, life will get better‚Äù ...and I have tried to get back to living, life hasn‚Äôt gotten better. 
I am also almost in constant pain after some surgery. It‚Äôs been 3 years of pain, and multiple specialists. When you‚Äôre in pain, with a sense of nothing to look forward to accept more pain... the world looks pretty grim. 
To make matters worse, I have very few friends left in Sydney. By few I mean one... and she‚Äôs busy.  I can go weeks without hearing from anybody. My husband is supportive, but he‚Äôs busy... and can‚Äôt offer advice or relate. I get the feeling he loves me but simply doesn‚Äôt know what to do or say. i guess if I don‚Äôt, then why should he. 
I honestly don‚Äôt expect anyone to say anything that will make me feel better. I guess I just needed to let someone, anyone know... perhaps someone will relate, or has experienced worse than I have and gotten though the other side. I have spoken to counsellor, but to be honest... they always want to discuss the deaths in my life... and considering they were pretty awful to witness, I don‚Äôt want to keep going over them. 
To anyone who takes the time to read this, thank you... and I‚Äôm so sorry for how pessemistic it sounds. I am not okay. I just pinned up photos of everyone who would care if I just ended my life... and it‚Äôs not many... it‚Äôs not many... 
In tears. I know there‚Äôs no easy solution... I just needed to at least write my thoughts down... even if it doesn‚Äôt solve anything.. at least I‚Äôve finally acknowledged that I‚Äôm not okay.

Hey all,
 
I lost my dad the other week from brain aneurysm. It was so sudden. I am finding it hard to cope with being so down. I can not stop thinking about dying and the thought of loosing my kids or anyone else close to me.  This is the first death in my intermediate family in my life that i have had to deal with. I am also a mum of 4 and help my husband run a business. I am also the oldest of 5 siblings. My dad was my mum's fulltime carer as she has battled some different illnesses and cancer twice. I am being strong for everyone but really feel myself declining.  I know i have to keep it together for my family as they need me. I just don't know what to do. I feel sick and so down i can not feel happy at all. I get it is still early stages but i do not know when i will ever feel better. Thanks for listening.

Hi,
When my Mum was 15 she had a baby with my now step father. I found out about her when I was 16 and we met. I always wanted an older sister and I was excited. As always life happens and it was difficult to keep in touch. In Dec b4 xmas she and her 3 yo son were killed overseas. She has 3 adult children that are still struggling with her loss. I always thought I would have time to get to know her better, but we didn't. I was so proud of all the obstacles life had thrown her way and how she met these challenges head on and maintained a positive up beat attitude and overcame them. I regret I never got the chance to tell her or get to know her better.
In Apr I also lost my Grandfather. He was my hero. When I was first diagnosed with MDD over 20 years ago he was my rock. It took me some time to tell him I had been diagnosed. I called him on a weekly basis for a chat, he always made me feel special and loved. We laughed and talked about immature things, cricket and AFL. He cared for my Grandmother, who suffered dementure , for 5 years on his own. When he was in his late 80's he was finally convinced help was needed. He moved interstate to be near his daughter and he only left Grandma when he was told by Nursing home staff. When she passed he was devastated. He lost his the love of his life. Every phone call after he would say he wants to die and be with her but he can't. He survived 5 years without her. I had always planned to visit him every 6 months. But life happened and I was never able to. I deeply regret that I could not be with him, talk with him or support him in the way he had done so for me.
This has all come to the surface now. I think I pushed it down to get on with life. My work has an assistance program for counselling but I have been before and I am not comfortable with them. I don't know what to do or who to turn to. My husband is not the best listener or most supportive person.
I can't sleep, I feel low, I am having lots of terrible thoughts, I'm teary, the only thing holding me together is my kids.
Any advice is welcome.

Hi, i lost my daughter in november 2017 at 20 weeks pregnant. I am now pregnant again which i am grateful for but i just feel so flat all the time. I think i may have antenatal anxiety and depression. I feel like a terrible mother because i just keep wishing i had my daughter here, she would be almost 3 months old now. But does that mean i dont want this new baby? I really dont now how to feel and im so sick of the thoughts running through my head and all the triggers that make me feel so sad about my daughter. Im also scared that something is going to go wrong in this pregnancy and i really could not handle that pain again.
My husband and i talked very openly when we lost our daughter but lately i havent felt like i can talk to him about  how low i feel. I think i am ashamed.
 
Any advice?

Hi All, I am new here and really don‚Äôt know where else to turn too for help, answers or support because no around me knows what to say or do. 
My fianc√© took his own life and has left a massive hole in me and our childrens lives. I don‚Äôt know I can go on any longer the pain I feel is like no other I have ever felt, I can hardly look at my children anymore I feel so empty inside and hearts broken for not only myself but my kids as well. I blame myself for what has happened, I feel like I should have done more to help him, I keep having all these ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô rolling in my head every second of every day and my gilt overwhelms me that I can‚Äôt even think straight or remember things. 
And on top of all this I‚Äôm putting onto myself his parents are blaming me as well, they are confirming everything that‚Äôs going inside my head and saying it was my fault this has happened. That our relationship was to blam and I drove him to do this to himself. I can‚Äôt even begin to explain how this is effecting me mentally, it‚Äôs making all my dark thoughts feel so true. It‚Äôs making me feel like I no longer what to be in this world, the pain I feel is to great to even get over. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, I feel hopeless. 
I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm looking for on here but maybe deep down I just don‚Äôt want to feel alone, that someone out there knows how I‚Äôm feeling? I want to make it through this but don‚Äôt know I can.

I'm new here but don't really have anyone to talk to. My partner's father died a couple of weeks ago and he is struggling with the grief. I'm trying so hard to be there for him and to help him through this but I keep getting told I don't understand. He's right. I've never lost a parent. I don't understand. I have my own issues with depression and infertility that I'm trying to push aside but if I get upset about anything or he says hurtful things then apparently I'm making it all about me. He's pushing me away when all I want to do is love and support him. I know eventually it might get a bit better but scared I'm going to lose him in the meantime. I've never felt so alone. I self-harmed tonight. I've never done anything like that before and it scares me. I don't expect any miracles but hoping if I can get it off my chest it might make it easier to deal with.

Hi All
My husband died nine months ago after an horrific illness that lasted almost 2 years. I have some PTSD from this. My psychologist thinks that I am over the grieving period. I have been seeing him for 18 years and he saw me and gave me support during this hard time. 
I have also battled depression for over 20 years. I have tried just about every med out there.
i put myself second as my husbands carer and I now am at the point where I think my depression is so overwhelming that I want to try ECT. I feel such despair, fear and cry uncontrollably every day. I have had three hospital stays in nine months. I can‚Äôt keep living this way.
I know I‚Äôm going to come up with people saying nine months isn‚Äôt long and that‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm also young <40 so I need to be able to comprehend a future. I think that ECT is my only option. I‚Äôm so medicated that I can‚Äôt see the harm and it‚Äôs worth a try. I have a grief counsellor too so I‚Äôve been very proactive in managing my health in the last nine months.
Any ideas about how to differentiate between depression and grief? I know depression is part of grief but my depression was pre existing. 
Thanks for reading.

So not sure how this all works or where to go or what to say.
On February 21st of this year my mum passed away at the hands of depressions close to 8 years after my pop passed the very same way. Since feb I have struggled to feel any sort of emotion or even connect to anything. I feel broken on the inside but unable to express or convey it in any way. Things have been nothing but stressful with my partner feeling like I don‚Äôt have any support, yet also feeling like I can‚Äôt put to much pressure on him. My friends have decided they don‚Äôt like my partner which has caused nothing but added stress, drama and unwarranted anxiety. I feel like ‚Äúwhat next‚Äù on a daily basis and just feel lost all around. In myself I know self harm is not the answer as unfortunately I‚Äôve now seen at the age of 25 two family members suffer for to long and knowing the after shock that follows.
Never having questions answered nor having an exact reason why. I lay here tonight missing my mum hearing her voice remind me it‚Äôs ok to be sad, don‚Äôt be ashamed to ask for help. So I guess I‚Äôm going out on a limb and expressing how I feel in a place I feel could and should be safe. As a young man I wonder how to go on. I can‚Äôt fathom a life without my mum but great full I had the time I did. I can‚Äôt picture my mum not being the one to show me how to hold my first child as she held me, I can‚Äôt imagine marrying the man I love without my mum by my side saying ‚Äúcmon let‚Äôs poor a wine it‚Äôs your wedding day‚Äù
Just like my Mum I‚Äôve stepped out to help and support so many others, in the short almost 3 months to the day multiple friends relationship breakups, friends parents giving their last fight before cancer wins, fall outs between friends and family and my partner then to my own health taking a turn and being forced to stop for a minute.
I feel like this is all over the place but that is just how my head feels one thing after another no time to stop and then when I decide to take a moment something else happens someone else happens. And don‚Äôt get me wrong I tell my friends I‚Äôd rather they come to me and talk when they feel their breakup is to much or parent is to sick or work is to hard, rather then suffer in silence before it‚Äôs to late like my mum and grandfather.
Not sure if all or any of this is suitable relatable or helpful but I just thought I‚Äôd let some of what‚Äôs going on in my head out.

When I was 20 my mum committed suicide. I'm now 26 and I feel deeper in my grief than ever before. I had a really delayed reaction to her death (I did not express any emotion for 2 years). We were a pretty normal tight family unit and I needed to be the strength for the rest of my family.
My mum left no note, and nobody really has any explanation of why she did what she did. She was such a great mum to my brother and I, and while I know she had problems (she was an alcoholic) she was a successful business woman and excellent mother, and nobody had any idea she was suicidal.
In addition to all the normal stuff you feel when someone dies this way, there is a lot of blame towards me and the rest of my immediate family from my extended family on her side. I get through this by understanding that sometimes people need to blame someone to cope but honestly it's so wrong that anyone could think anyone was responsible. Particularly my brother and my dad and I. We would have moved heaven and earth had we known she was in danger.
Even so, I feel like I have failed the most important person in my life and I'm haunted by what happened. The permanence of her death still has not settled in and it hits me in waves and knocks me right off my feet.
What should I do? Is there anything I can do?

Hi, I'm 18 yrs old and new to this forum. I'm in my first year at uni and I live at a residential college about 3 hours from home. 
Just over 7 weeks ago my dog passed away. She meant everything to me and her death was so sudden and such a shock because she was perfectly healthy, I was a mess for weeks after and just couldn't cope with her being gone. I saw a counselor after a few weeks of grieving because I was just not feeling any better and my mood was not improving at all, I was barely sleeping, I was still crying every day, and I was just not coping well with life. I was having suicidal thoughts and was thinking of ways to end my life.
I then saw a GP and have been on 2 different sleeping tablets over the past 3 weeks but they only work for one or two nights before they stop working. I've been on antidepressants for 2 weeks but I don't feel these have made any change to my mood at all. I am just feeling very down and hopeless and exhausted all day. I don't have anything to look forward to in life, and I dread having to go back home because last time I went home, I hated being there without my dog and I really struggled to cope and it just made me feel worse. I find it so hard to talk to my parents about what I feel, I don't want them to overreact or make a fuss, or come up to see me at all or phone me heaps. I also just don't think they'll understand what goes through my head all day.
I am trying to go to uni to distract myself and to try not get too far behind, but I am finding it so hard to concentrate on my work, I keep zoning out and thinking about life and dying, and about my dog. I am quite far behind at uni but I am past the point of caring about much anymore. I just feel like every day is the same, nothing seems to get better, and I don't see any point in continuing to live if this is what I feel like every day. I am so unmotivated to do anything and I just feel like my life is meaningless and nothing I do matters anymore. 
 I have been looking up methods of suicide and I am often thinking about ways to end my life, to stop the pain and all these thoughts that are in my head all day. A week ago I got quite bad and wanted to run away anywhere out of this place, I just couldn't handle it anymore, but I managed to force myself to stay and tried to distract myself to stop the thoughts.
I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm feeling so hopeless and down and exhausted all the time, and just needed to get it all out. Sorry for the long post.

hello
I'm a new member.  I'm feeling so upset.  I thought I was prepared for my Mum's death but I wasn't.  It's four months now and the days and nights are such a struggle.
I'm dreading all the ""firsts"" ..this coming Mothers Day, an upcoming family celebration, my birthday, her birthday. ...you get the idea.
On top of that I'm dealing with the likelihood of having to have a loved pet put to sleep.
I'm very fortunate to have a loving partner and lovely girls but I have never felt so lonely ..if that makes sense.
Please tell me I'm not alone.   I'm alternating between crying a lot of the time and/or getting upset and angry with my loved ones.
I have suffered with anxiety and depression for most of my  life..close to forty years so this also multiplies the grief.
Thank you for taking the time to read.

I dont live with mum anymore, i wanted to have my own life, and didnt want mum clinging to me. but now, between mum's memory loss and her depression getting far far worse. she talks about wishing she was dead, crying all day, being unbearably lonely all the time.
i have tried to get her to see the GP. and her psychologist. neither has really helped. Finally mum met a woman who has had ECT and thought she too might benefit from hospital treatment to get on the right meds. she told the doctor and the doctor gave her a psychiatrist. she didn't like last years psychiatrist. this years psych, she can't see for 2 months. two months of her telling me every day that she never wants to leave the house again, that she hates where she lives, that she wishes she were dead.
then of course every other day where she seems aware of her situation and wants to try to fight it... but I know by the time she gets around ot doing anything the feelings will change (within the day).
i suffer depression and anxiety too. not to her extent, i'm able to self manage. talk myself up, mostly. but i dont wantto be around mum when she is like this. she makes me so angry, she one day is asking me to help her get a dog trainer, the next day she's cancelling and telling me it's all too much... i dont have much time or energy in my own life, i work full time and i barely cope with that. i like my alone time. i sleep poorly. amd i'm generally just struggling to have any social life at all.
i called the crisis team and they told me to get a sooner appointment with the psychiatrist, but i dont know who they are, mum will never get around to doing anything about it, and her doctor wont tell me anything, or generally do anything much of use... they've left her like this for thirty years... they did nothing for my dad either.
 
i feel trapped. i want to take her to a hospital and say to them"" take her, make her better."" but i know because she doesn't actually plan how to commit suicide they wont do anything. i'm the only person in the world she has. i feel guilty half the tie, angry the other half and overlay it all with a desperation. i know others have it harder, i know some daughters are full time carers for their parents... but i want to have a life..
and i dont know how to cope the next two months or longer until some medical professional sees how serious it is and bothers to get involved and actually help her.

Hello,
My mum died of cancer almost six weeks ago, and I am not coping at all. I was living and working in another city and as soon as I found out I dropped everything and came to be her full-time carer. She was diagnosed at the beginning of December and died at the end of January. I never left her side and slept every night in the hospital for three weeks. I called an ambulance after New Year's because I felt I wasn't coping at home, and I feel tremendous guilt about that because I felt it made things happen faster. I am still beside myself with grief every day. I miss her so much.

I don't really have anyone here that I can talk to either. My dad (who has never been reliable) has stopped talking to me, which hurts a lot as well. My friends are all in other cities. I don't know the rest of my family that well and even so, they all live overseas. I feel completely alone. 

I am still paying rent on an apartment in Sydney as I haven't had the capacity to make any decisions about my life yet. I am going back to work in Sydney on the 19th of March. They're letting me come back part-time, which is nice. But I don't know how I'm going to do it. I have to be at my Mum's house, in another city, to look after her three animals and to sort out the house, which she still has a mortgage on. So at this stage I will be commuting, but it's a 6-hour commute every day by train, and it will be very exhausting. I need to get out of my lease, but I feel unable to do anything. There are bills piling up and I need to call various places to explain what's happened, but I don't know what's wrong with me, I can't do anything. I feel triggered by every little thing. I see a bill and it makes me cry, I hear an ambulance and it makes me cry, I feel like making a cup of tea and it reminds me of her and makes me cry. I'm paralyzed. 
All I can think about all the time is my Mum and what she went through and what happened. Every time I close my eyes I see her last moment or I hear her struggling to breathe or I remember every little detail of the hospital and the cancer. I feel like I'm going to be sick. It's unbearable. I feel like I can't do it anymore and I really need help and I don't know how to get it, so here I am.

Hi, i lost my younger brother in january this year to GVHD after having a transplant from leukaemia, he was 26.
Iv gone through so many emotional stages since he passed but now as time is going on I'm struggling to come to terms with knowing iv lost my only sibling , my best friend, my sons uncle and the person i would call daily to talk about anything or ask stupid questions. I'm so lost in life now and every night getting close to bed time i get these sick feelings he wasn't meant to go there was something else they didnt try, flash backs of his final week when they said there wasn't anything more they caN do but to just make him comfortable now , he basically was asleep 24/7 for 3 or 4 days before he passed but a few days before that he was starting to get confused , i remember him getting scared when a nurse entered n he said no no I'm going home, or if he was in pain looking at me saying please help but the look on his face i had never seen before, when i think of all this my heart races and i clench up , i just feel so sad for him he went through 3 years of pain but every hurdle thrown at him he overcame it like a king but then out of no where from a general hospital stay like any other he had had he never came home .
i dont have a a lot of friends a couple of close ones but iv pulled my self away from them as i just feel like I'm on repeat, and i know no matter how many times i tell them about all this there is only so much they can say back to me before they are just repeating it too and i dont want to continue to burden them with it . 
Has anyone else had or been thru something smilier to this

So my grandpa died this morning and I need to rant. Ok so a bit of backstory, I was really close to my grandpa he was like my parent as a kid when my parents divorced I lived with them for years and he and my nana live next door so I see them everyday, he was my favourite relative. He was diagnosed with skin cancer about 5 months ago and he was in a lot of pain and was in hospital for a while but he was slowly getting better but then they found out he had cancer in his lymph system that it was aggressive and was incurable that was less than 3 months ago. He was really depressed and lost 50kg in a month and has been in and out of hospital and in pain and he has been really mean, grumpy and depressed for a few months. Last week he got pneumonia and went into hospital and has been there since and he just wanted to die so he wouldn't let the doctors treat the pneumonia so they just kept him comfortable.
I have been really detached and unfeeling since we found out he was sick and I was fine I didn't feel anything unlike the rest of my family who have been sad and worried. I went to see him last night and he was unresponsive so we just sat there and the others were talking to him but I didn't because it made me uncomfortable and  didn't know what to say or do. My parents told me he died this morning and I just went oh ok and went back to sleep and was fine all day I studied did a test and went to uni all fine and I haven't cried until I wrote this & IDK why? maybe because he hasn't been himself since and it feels like he was already gone, maybe its because I'm mad at him for not letting them treat him, maybe something is wrong with me idk, I'm ok and then I remember I'll never see him again I didn't even go see the body I just went back to bed. I hate showing feeling in front of people especially family so I will never cry in front of them or tell them how I feel.
Sorry about the rant I don't really know what the point is.

Hi all,
My first time posting here. Perhaps a trigger warning for people who have experienced a loss.
On the 20th of December my mum passed away from a 3 month batttle with brain cancer. It was a very quick decline, and toward the end she wasn't very lucid, and sometimes didn't even recognize me. She was only 44 when she passed, I am only 21. 
I've really struggled the last 6 weeks. I took 2 weeks off work before her death to care for her, and I was there until the very last moment. She passed away at home with myself and my sister standing beside her.
 After she passed I took about a week and a half off work and have been back at work ever since. Been back at work for a month now. It's been pretty hard, and my job is very demanding, not allowing me to take a moment when I need to, I have to be on the job and in the moment every minute of work.
I've taken one day off work since being back, and I guess I'm wanting to take a bit more time off, to gather myself and deal with all my emotions. Do you think it's okay for me to call in sick once a week or fortnight to have a mental health day while I'm still grieving?
I've struggled with depression and anxiety in the past, and I'm struggling now. It's hard to get out of bed, to be motivated and to go to work, but I do. I'm never fully in the moment, well at least that's what it feels like. I feel so hazey and foggy all the time. 
Has anyone got any tips or advice? Things that have helped them in these kind of situations?

Thank you in advance to anyone who takes the time to read, I really appreciate having a platform to get things off my chest.
I was inviting my dad who lives alone on his farm to Christmas when i wasnt gettting a response and his mobile was turned off. I went to check on him and found him dead on his bed.¬†I was spared seeing his whole body and an autopsy done the next day which revealed he had a gastrointestinal bleed.
I had watched my mother pass away from cancer four years earlier and now to find my father passed away. I‚Äôm Not even 30 years old and I have no parents left and I only ever had one brother.
I‚Äôm married with 3 beautiful children who have helped me get through. But I find when they are in bed and I suddenly have all this time to think, it‚Äôs all I think about and I get this heavy sadness over me. we are also clearing out his property for sale and it‚Äôs been hard to wrap my head around that he is gone. He was a very healthy man so it came as a huge shock.
Thank you again for anyone reading, it has already helped just writing my about experience and hope maybe someone with similar experience can share some light on their experiences.

Hi
My mother died 12 years ago. She was a wonderful mother and I was lucky to have her. I always thought I would still be able to have a normal and happy life and be ok. 
I‚Äôm now in my mid 30s with no kids and this is causing me immense grief - equal to losing mother. My life is not normal. I am in a relationship with a married man with 2 kids. The grief that my life hasn‚Äôt turned out how I planned has resulted in day time drinking, heavy night drinking and small amounts of drug taking every weekend. 
I feel like I am watching my life from the sidelines. Knowing I‚Äôm not being wise in my choices, but unable to get the life I want.

Hi everyone,
I wasn‚Äôt sure whether to put this in the depression or relationship forums as it‚Äôs a bit of both. I‚Äôm currently really not in a good place mentally and emotionally. My motivation to do anything is pretty much non-existent and I‚Äôm feeling so lonely. Long story short, my grandma died three months ago, and at that already turbulent time my three and a half year relationship with my girlfriend ended.
I was already not in a great place before all this happened, I wasn‚Äôt happy where I was in life mostly because 1. I‚Äôm in a job I no longer get any satisfaction out of, and it feels like my life is going nowhere and 2. I hurt my back really badly a back in June and had to stop lighting weights which is the only exercise I enjoy. Because of this I stupidly started pushing my girlfriend away, and things boiled over shortly after an overseas trip where we felt more like friends than SO‚Äôs at times.
On top of the negative thoughts I already had, I‚Äôm so full of regret and guilt that it‚Äôs eating me away, both over my relationships with my grandma and my now ex-girlfriend.
I‚Äôm trying to make changes in my life, but it‚Äôs really hard to do even the smallest things. I‚Äôve applied to go back to uni to follow my career dream but I didn‚Äôt get in for the first round and that hit me hard. I feel like my happiness is tied to whether or not I get in to uni this year. But at the same time even if I do get in I can‚Äôt help but compare myself to my peers, many of whom are off getting married and/or are in careers they enjoy. It also really didn‚Äôt help that the night I told my parents my girlfriend and I had broken up my dad let slip that my previous ex is now engaged. Meanwhile I‚Äôm back single again at 28 and wanting to go back to uni to do another undergraduate degree. I have zero motivation and I‚Äôm so tired with life in general. I have a history of melancholic depression and I‚Äôm currently seeing my GP and a psychologist, but I feel they‚Äôre not helping me as much as they have in the past.

I lost my mother almost 2 months ago. It was a very big shock and very unexpected. She had a massive stroke right in front of me. She was in ICU for 3 days whilst on life support suffering from severe brain damage caused from the stroke. I keep getting flashbacks of the traumatic event that I usually can‚Äôt block out. I am tired of crying myself to sleep every night. I am still grieving, I need to talk to someone but I am unsure where to start. Do I need counseling, therapy, or a psychiatrist?

Hi,
2 days ago we had to put down my 16-year-old cat. I had him for over half my life, he was there when I was diagnosed with depression, when I was suicidal and when I started getting better and being 'normal' (somewhat). He was my constant. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety over 10 years ago and for about 4-3 years it's been for the most part controllable. I have my ups and downs, but mostly up or neutral. Because of this event, I feel like I don't know how I will be able to get through this, I don't want to slip back in to depression but I don't want to move on either. I have upped my anti-depressant dose and made an appointment with my psychiatrist (unfortunately it won't be until early January). In the meantime my mum and other cat are helping me through this, but I still can't see an end to this pain, especially with Christmas coming up, my cat loved christmas. By the way he wasn't just a cat or pet for me, he was/is family and always will be. Please let me know if you have had a pet that you went through depression with and lost them later. How have you coped with it?

I lost my husband last year to cancer.  We are both young ... in our 30s.  In a way, I never thought that I would lose him because he was so incredibly strong. It was like I had spent the whole cancer battle/diagnosis in denial which I labelled as blind hope that if he just held on long enough there would be some new treatment that would control it.  He died in my arms and my whole world changed. I feel like I've had all my limbs cut off.
I thought I was coping okay but recently I've been noticing more and more that I am doing things that worry me.  I am struggling to fall asleep at night. I hate eating and it seems like a pointless activity. In fact, I can't really find much enthusiasm for anything. It's not that I feel depressed all the time. More like I just feel numb, angry and irritable. I have been having large crying episodes every day that I hide from friends and family ... but I don't mind these, feeling the pain and the triggers of these episodes is better than feeling nothing at all.  I am trying to get out and exercise regularly and to go to work but the level of fatigue I have is awful. Sometimes just having a simple conversation with someone is absolutely exhausting. I sometimes can't bring myself to respond to a conversation. I'm starting to really struggle with concentration at work and doing simple tasks is taking too long.
I saw a psychologist after my husband passed and I don't know if it will be worth doing this again. I don't know if talking about any of this is going to help. Nothing is going to bring him back so maybe I just need to suck it up and ride this whole thing out?  Being young it is hard to find support groups out there for people my age. I find it hard to talk about him with people because of how they react - people who know me well are grieving too ... people who don't know me well often don't know how to react and it's very uncomfortable between the apologies from them and the looking at me like I need sympathy.  
I don't know what brought me here, but now I'm here if anyone has any suggestions I'm all ears. Thanks for your time.

Hello,
It's been a couple of months since my last post. I am guilty of only checking these boards regularly when I'm not doing too well. Putting my thoughts, fears and worries out there into the universe seems to help somewhat.
My little dog had to be put down this morning and I'm feeling devastated. I loved him so much and as I'm single and not working he was a big part of my day to day happiness. He was such a joy filled little fellow and I'm going to miss him so much. Everything in the house reminds me of him.
He was a family dog so I have support from my parents and sister but I'm starting to unravel as I'm terrified that I'm going to relapse and have a terrible episode of anxiety/depression again (they've been triggered before by smaller issues than this). I only got half an hour sleep last night so am hoping I'll be able to think more rationally tomorrow after I've slept but I just don't know how I'll get over this.

Hi guys, I am wondering if anyone knows about the relationship with grief and anxiety? It is something I have only come heard of recently. Or if this story sounds familiar to anyone and you have any tips to help, that would be greatly appreciated.
im a 24yo male in Melbourne Aus. Have always been fairly shy/ anxious person and never very happy. My father committed suicide when I was 16 who I was very close to, also lost a fair few other friends and family members not long after too.
i have always tried to be tough and just try ignore these losses when they occurred, I was back at school 2 days after my Dads death and just tried forcing myself to move on. I still think about what happened that night pretty much every day but never get emotional about it, just try put on a brave face and move on.
i suffered with depression and social anxiety issues for the years following my dads death, but it was fairly manageable and wasn't 24/7 life controlling like it is now
about 2 years ago I took some MDMA at a party and got my first panic attack the next day. Since then have been anxious as hell, constantly feel like I'm in a dream (depersonalisation), insomnia that never seems to end, and non stop racing negative thoughts to the point I've nearly taken my own life a few times.
feel like it has slowly started to get better after all the different councelling and medication. but I feel like there's something else to it and that cbt and meds aren't going completely fix my issues. 
Came across some YouTube videos of speakers talking about holding grief causing anxiety problems, my therapist also believes this could be a part of my problem too. Does anyone know much about this? any replies greatly appreciated, thanks

17/11 my life changed forever. I woke up for work and found my mother on the couch who had a stroke through out the night. The ambulance was called and she was rushed straight to the royal melbourne hospital. She suffered a 19mm aneurysm to her brain a well a lot of intense swelling. Whilst on life support on an induced coma in ICU after 3 days she sadly passed away. This was VERY UNEXPECTED I am 26 and my mother was 61. She is my best friend and my everything. The rock to my family. Her death was unfair and so heart breaking. I cannot sleep at night because I think about all the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù. I find it hard to get out of bed and have been relying on friends to help me rest my brain. I‚Äôm often dehydrated and my heart is constantly pounding. Do I need counciling, therapy, a visit to the doctor? I just find each day getting harder and harder.

My Dad was so good. He was everything you could imagine a kind hearted, selfless person could be. I cannot believe he is even gone. Even writing ‚Äúwas‚Äù is bringing me to terms with the fact he is no longer here.
I‚Äôm still half expecting him to call in and give me a lecture about how my car needs a service or that my lawn should be mowed.
It doesn‚Äôt feel real, yet he died 4 days ago. I still haven‚Äôt really accepted it.
He was only 51 and leaves behind my sister, brother, mother and my two children (who ADORED him)
He was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer about a year ago. Underwent chemo for eight months then, when it was discovered the chemo wasn‚Äôt doing anything, the doctors gave him 3 months to live. 
I watched on as he slowly deteriorated and feel like I never really got to say all the things I wanted to before he left. 
Why can‚Äôt I feel like he is actually gone? This is crazy.

Hi guys, I am a newbie here and am not really sure if this is the right thing for me.
A few months ago, a friend of mine was suddenly killed in an accident. She was fairly well known in the community and it hit everyone hard, but because I have been trying to be the strong one and help everyone I haven't really been able to help myself. I continually have meltdowns caused by the smallest of things that remind me of her and it just seems to get worse every time. 
I am not really sure how to deal with it anymore and I just keep closing myself out from everyone and telling them I am okay. 
I just wish there was someway to deal with the pain and stop these constant feelings of sadness and getting upset when I think of her :( 
What should I do?

My brother took his life on the 31/10/2017. I‚Äôm still in the process of organising his funeral, he is the 2nd brother in 2 years. My 1st brother, official coroner‚Äôs report stated ‚ÄúDeath Due To Misadventure‚Äù¬† he has self medicated his entire life, Bi-Polar was his official diagnosis, and now, my closest brother also end his life!! I battled his depression with him for years, I put my own PTSD and depression on the back burner to get him better, I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of losing another brother!! I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of having to tell my mother again and listen to that gut wrenching wail and her screaming we are lying to her! I promised my brother we would kick this together, and I dropped the ball... now I‚Äôm beginning to think, they should never have relied on me in the beginning, I tried so hard to protect them, their fellings, my mother, her ‚Äúshame‚Äù you know, cause ‚ÄúBoys don‚Äôt cry‚Äù and all that!! I really don‚Äôt know how the hell im meant to move forward when I can‚Äôt process the fact he‚Äôs gone! I was only able to look at his photo yesterday, before that, I have stomped around making threats of violence to anyone who looks at me! I told my kids to stay away for a few days in case I said something I didn‚Äôt mean.... I can‚Äôt understand why he left me with this heartache! He knew how I felt! I would have hidden him forever!! I would have lied to everyone... if it meant keeping him here, I would have done it! Can someone please make sense of this!! I‚Äôm absolutely devastated

I just turned 18 this year and I was excited to discover and explore my newfound freedom, so much so that I didn't get to spend as much time that I wanted to with my small 10yr old sister (who happens to have severe cerebral palsy) before she passed away. Growing up as a sibling to a disabled child, you learn to quickly find your place in the family. In my case I have 1 older sister and 4 younger ones after me. So me, my elder sister, including my Mum were her main carers. I always knew that I held 2nd place in my parents' hearts with all my other siblings, right after my 10yr old sister who I knew held 1st place. I learned to never complain when I didn't get the attention I probably needed from my parents, or when I had to stay home most days to babysit, even when as a family we couldn't go for typical family outings, because who was I to complain against my lovely sister. She was never a burden.
About a month ago I woke up in the morning to my 15 yr old sister's screams against my bedroom door, and I quickly went to see what was wrong.¬†000 was dialled and I was told to perform CPR on her until the ambulance came. I kept crying out to God to help me, that I would do anything, but she still wasn't responding. The medics said the situation looked bad, and they'd take her to the hospital. It was too late she passed away that morning.
The events of that day still haunt me. Walking past her room and seeing the spot where I performed CPR.It's all getting too much for me. I try to go out and forget, but sometimes I find my chest gets so heavy that I can't breathe. I still don't know how I'm going to get through this. I miss her so much and It's just starting to hit me that I'm never going to hold her again.

HI. Now I'm here my fingers have frozen with fear. Ok inhale...exhale...go...
Can a person relapse back into the once depressed, guilt riddled, grief stricken, sucicidal person she once was 8 years ago? Even after all the work she has done on herself?
I can feel my feet slowly slipping out from me, but the icy ground hasn't cracked yet. 
Everyone around me says they are here for me but I know everyone is thinking ""god her daughter drowned in her care eight years ago, she should be over it by now"" whilst telling me how strong I am and how proud of me they are. 
STRONG!!!! I'm the absolute opposite. I guess that mask I wear is working and no one sees the real me.  But why do I pretend because I feel so lonely and completely invisible. 
Two years ago my post here would have been to help people who have lost a child and now my post is asking for an empathic ear because I've used all mine up. 
I have managed to successfully isolate myself from my friends and sadly no one has really noticed. I moved four hours away from home and changed my number. It felt refreshing at the start. 
Is this why I have relapsed? I have told my partner I'm starting to slip and he just tells me I'll be fine. 
Will I be?

Hi everyone , didnt think I'd have to go thorough this again , but here I am . 6 years ago , my wife of 20 years passed away after an 8 year battle with cancer . Her loss wasn't completely unexpected but devastating , nonetheless . I did seek counselling and it did help . 12 months on , I met and fell in love with a wonderful woman and fell madly in love with her .She had her demons but we were happy . A couple of Saturdays ago , her elderly mother passed away and she took it terribly . 3 days later she was rushed to emergency , and while very unwell , not in my worst nightmare did I imagine her , too , passing away . Totally unexpected , and I am so lost and broken . Has anyone else suffered the loss of two life partners and how the hell do you cope . Cheers in advance for any advice

Hi 
I have a beautiful 14 month old baby girl and just lost my second baby girl due to kidney problems. I had a very difficult pregnancy and birth in both cases and my first baby has hip dyslasia and so has had procedures and hip spica cast and is still requiring treatment. After losing my second baby there is a large possibility that I might not be able to carry a third child. I am physically and emotionally unwell and feel like this is affecting my relationships especially with my husband  as well as the way I raise and take care of my daughter. I'm just reaching out to anyone who may have experienced something similar and what helped them cope and manage everyday life and accepting what happened. I have very supportive parents but at times I feel like everyone has their own lives to deal with. 
Thankyou for taking the time to read what I've experienced.

Hi all, 
Im not sure if I'm posting in the right category, but in 2009 I lost my nan, at that time I was only 9 and so I didn't really understand what was happening. But I remember everything like it was yesterday. Since I've become older and more mature I've started to understand things better and I really wish I hadn't have. This is due to the loss of my nan (8 years ago) taking a massive toll on me in this current day and age. I'm really unsure how to cope with it. 
 
The reason I feel I'm so upset about it is because, 

My nan was my bestfriend
i was so close with her
its taken me this long to actually feel anything.

I'm currently in year 12 and everything's becoming more and more stressful. I can't talk to my parents or siblings about my nan because it hurts them as much as it hurts me. Is it normal to think ""am I doing the right thing?"" I've gone to a psychologist but she couldn't help me.

Hey Guys. am new to the Forum. Have suffered Depression most of my life & diagnosed with BiPolar about 10 years ago. Medication mix has been great & I've been coping with Life etc well.  Wednesday this week, 2nd August, is the 1st Anniversary of my Mother's Death. it was a strained relationship, with lots of verbal abuse over many years.  She was a negative, nasty person in her final years, mainly brought about by my Father leaving her after 47 odd years of marriage. (He became the biggest bastard in the world as she continued to be negative) She was a control freak, like her mother before her, & because I did what She did, break the rules & become a stronger person & live my life the way I wanted to, including giving up 2 careers because she took control & manipulated a situation & took my kids off me back in the early 80's,  I was the worst person in the world. My brother & my son were the shining lights in her life as she was a product of her generation & very much a male orientated person. Us Girls were always in trouble etc. all the bloody time.... so after looking after her in her last months, getting her the care she needed & into an aged care facility, visiting every day etc, the final logical thing she said to was abuse. she died 4 days later.  My brother, sis in law & I were all with her as she passed quietly & peacefully, for which I am thankful. 
I am in such a mess with my thoughts. I'm very flat, after being so good for so long, I'm not sleeping, I'm writing down what I can i n my diary. Trying to keep busy & do things around the house, looking after my daughter & the kids as well at the moment.   it's Star Trek Sunday at the moment so I'm distracting myself with my Star Trek as well. 
I would welcome Ideas of how to cope over the next few days.  I hope I can take on board your suggestions. 
Keep well, people. Peace & Long LIfe.

Hi everyone,

I've never written on a forum before so I hope I'm doing it correctly. 

I'm a 47 yr old female with a long history of depression and social anxiety. I‚Äôm in a relationship with someone I believe has Aspergers. He
displays many of those traits, in particular an astounding lack of empathy. We‚Äôve been together for just under 2 years. We‚Äôve been living
together for 4 months.

3 months ago my little brother suddenly passed away. Last weekend my father was diagnosed with aggressive terminal cancer. The one thing
I need right now is empathy. While I love my partner, his inability to accept that I'm in a lot of pain is destroying that love. I find myself avoiding going home because I just don't want to deal with it. I want to move out but everyone I talk to says I shouldn't make any rash decisions at this
point in time. My question is - how do I stay where I am when things are only going to get more painful for me? I'm fearful that keeping the status quo is only going to cause another mental breakdown and this is the very last thing my mother needs.

Thoughts and suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.

Hi
My husband suicided 17mths ago and I am trying to help my children deal with their grief but struggle myself. I have 4 daughters, 3 still at home. We all still have trouble understanding his suicide and go through times of depression but I really worry about them. The youngest spends so much time by herself in her room and only seems to enjoy watching YouTube videos. A week ago she told her friends she wanted to kill herself.
 My 15yr old has OCD and was diagnosed before his death but now her anxieties are consuming her. She doesn't sleep very well and mostly sleeps with me. Sometimes she can't eat breakfast because she is too anxious about going to school. She won't eat much at school either and then binges in the afternoon because she is hungry. 
My 17yr old seems to be doing OK at the moment but she gets quite depressed too. A few months after her Dad's death she said she thought suicide was inevitable for her. 
My oldest is getting married in 3 weeks but she is unhappy sometimes and can't say why. I also worry that her fianc√© has some anger/control issues. He is a nice guy and has been very supportive of her but I have seen him try to physically restrain her when she is upset and he has left bruises when he holds her. 
 I know this is a lot and I know that there is no quick solutions but I was hoping for some advice to try and some moral support. I am not doing so good myself and would appreciate some positive thoughts from others. 
Thanks

Hi, Beyond Blue. I am an extremely smart and popular student from a great middle class family.
I am, also, an emotionally unstable bisexual alcoholic (or close to becoming one), who can not miss a chance to take something stronger than liqour to kill the pain and void, which I often feel since I was 13, or to make my anomalously high level of unreasonable happiness even higher.
Around two weeks ago, while experiencing that ""anomalously high level of unreasonable happiness"", I learned that my... friend... commited suicide. We did not talk for over than a year, because of some argument. And, actually, she was probably the person to which my feelings were closest to ""love"".
At first couple of days these news went pretty unnoticed to me. It did not matter much to me, as I was completing each of my difficult assignemnts, which usually take me ages to finish, in less than 3 hours, partying, having great time with my lover. Then, however, the realisation have started coming down on me. Instead of the study, that I planned for one evening, I broke up with my lover over the phone, went to the club, danced, drank excessive amounts of alcohol, had sex with another guy, who I knew just for 15 minutes. In another couple of days as my maniacal happiness was continuing I was continuing to party, consume drugs and engaging in risky behavior, still trying to hide those news.
As that time, as everythig good, came to an end, and I returned to having a normal, but slow, life. Still, however, I was trying not to think about what two days ago dropped me into this void of drunken misery.
I regret so much. I regret that we were not together this year and last. Hell, I don't know what to do, and even my abuse of alcohol doesn't get me out of this mess for even, at least, a couple of hours.

My darling of 28 yrs recently passed away from Leukaemia. He had 7 ish months of chemo, copped an absolute flogging and just kept hacking it. He was an absolute hero throughout.Nearly died 3 times.
We knew it'd come back but not as quick as it did. He got about 5 wks back home and was told he had less than a month to live. Imagine hearing that.¬†

It's really hard. I miss him terribly. Can't fully comprehend he's not coming back.¬†
We were happy and lucky to have each other but that's hard to think about atm.¬†
The mind's an amazing thing and protects you from the pain.¬†
I have Bipolar so that certainly gives me a dose of pain when on the down side.¬†
I've seen small changes in the grieving process.(Moving through).¬†
Got good friends but sometimes it's just too hard to fathom or want to for that matter.¬†
Love him sooo much.¬†
Not bloody fair.¬†

Hi,
My husband committed suicide and I would like to know if there are any organisations helping the victims. Because with every suicide there is far more victims left behind with the potential of depression to follow. My husband was hospitalized twice and not once did the hospital call me in to talk to them about what was going on at home and warning me of possible warning signs. I tried with the psychiatrist and he was not interested in anything but medication. He did not visit the home once. His psychologist appointed by the hospital told me when I rang him the day he died that he could not get Michael to talk. (Drrrrr). He did not ask me how I was, he just got defensive. His GP said that he should of had shock treatment when I called her. NO ONE ask how I or my children were going. I am looking after myself with regular physiologist's help. I have done that on my own. I have looked on both The Black Dog website and Beyond blue and there is nothing there. I was wondering if there are any others out there like myself.I would love to be able to talk to someone with the same experience with the suicide of there partner.

Hi everyone 
I'm new here and this is my first post. 
I was diagnosed with bipolar ii disorder in November 2016.
My mum has just had exploratory surgery where a large inoperable tumour mass was found. It's believed to be secondary breast cancer which she battled 7 years ago. We are currently awaiting pathology results to see how and if it can be treatment. In any case she won't survive this but hopefully buy some time. 
Im very close to my mum except for last year where she didn't understand mental health and I kept my distance and never told her my diagnosis as I knew she wouldn't cope with it. 
I feel sad for the arguments we had and the lost time. I feel responsible for it all and my illness and I'm angry I got sick. I was very suicidal and incorrectly treatment with antidepressants which made things a when lot worse. 
I'm lucky to be alive and my mum doesn't know the half of it. I don't regret keeping it from her but believe I should have handled it better and kept a better relationship with her. I feel guilt as now my time is limited with her. 
I've been medicated since December slowly increasing on an anti epileptic which is good for BP ii. I finally got to the correct dose in February and things have been better and more stable. Combined with counselling. 
But I haven't been able to sleep with my mind racing and I just randomly cry and go from crying to focussed that we can fight this. I feel confused and I don't know if this is normal or whether the bp ii is making my moods go all over the place. 
I don't know if this is triggering issues and I don't know how I'm going to cope with this. 
I have two little boys under 6 and not working as I gave up my career last year when I got sick but was hoping to return to it this year. I can't afford to fall apart for their sake. 
 Anyone help Me? 
 Thank you x

My father, who was also my best friend, passed away suddenly just over a week ago. We have been extremely close since my mother passed away from cancer when I was 18. The ambulance I called was unable to get to him as his house is hard to access, I ended up finding him unresponsive, they said it was a heart attack. He has a long and complicated medical history and has survived a heart attack before. I am having flashbacks to finding him and trying to wake him and am experiencing extreme feelings of guilt for not getting to him soon enough, I had spoken to him a few hours earlier and he said he was short of breath and to see if he could move his doctor's appointment a few days earlier, they couldn't and said if he should go to hospital, he said he would see how he went, I kept calling him every 20 minutes and he eventually said he would get ready to go to hospital and call me back. He didn't and I couldn't get a hold of him so I called and told the ambulance to go there. I feel that I should have known how serious it was and ignored him telling me he was ok and just got them there earlier, I was at work about half an hour away on the train which is why it took me awhile to get to him. I miss him so much and whilst my husband (who was also very close to my dad) is being amazing, my mentally disabled sister who was in my dad's care has come to live with us and he is great with her, I can't see how I will ever feel ok again and be able to move on. It feels like a piece of me has died with him. I am seeing a counsellor on Tuesday but just wanted to speak to someone who knows how I feel before then as I'm really not coping. Thanks

Recently I lost my mother (my best friend) to a horrible suicide and to make it worse she this was her second attempt but this one left me completed blind. We spoke everyday and I thought we were confiding to each other about everything and I thought she was finally staring to get the help she needed. She was diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and was prone to rapid mood swings and also unfortunately like many, was a drinker (wine or whatever she could get her hands on). I'm at the stage that I keep blaming myself for missing the signs and for not being there to prevent it happening. I tried so hard to help her but she refused to admit there was a problem on any count - she experienced a hard life and at one stage was put on anti depression tablets - unsure if correct dosage but with drinking I guess that's hard to know. But basically I can't make sense of her passing and am struggling to do the most basic things in my own life. I just miss her so intently and and feel like I'm in a million pieces but half my soul has gone. I'm just unable to cope with the grief and was wandering if anyone who has gone through something similar can offer me advice on how to deal immediately? I am waiting on professional grief counselling but I'm also scared that I too may have the disorder as I sense I am changing and rational thoughts are rare. If any one can other some words of wisdom - please help xo

I'm only a kid, last year in October I drove to my friends house for a sleepover with mum but mum didn't get back home. She got hit by two underage 15/17 year old boys that did a hit and run but were driving 60km over the speed limit. Mums car then got blown up into flames and she died straight away at the scene. I feel so sad since and don't know how to feel. Also my mum was and always will be my bestfriend I told her everything. She put everyone first and herself very far second, very loyal, happy, and funny lady that I adore so much. In 2015 she also tried committing suicide so was in hospital for over 9 months getting therapy. She only just conquered that horrible experience and for this to happen its ruin my families lives completely.

Hi everyone, I am struggling right now. My mum passed away 5 weeks ago and I have become the carer for my Autistic sister. She is in respite care but I have a long list of things to do with the house and my sister. My dad passed away 12 years ago so I am it!!  I thought I was coping ok till this week. My doc says that I am mentally paralysed, my mind is racing at a thousand miles an hour but I can't do anything or make a decision. 
Yesterday I was getting my two kids ready for school and my heart started racing and I started panicking. The last two days I can't seem to calm my heart down. It feels like I am running a race. I imagine I am having a panic attack but I dont know as I have never had one before. I am so scared of doing anything and making decisions. My husband is wonderful but I can also see he is getting frustrated at me. I am lost and don't know where to turn. I wake up crying in the middle of the night and all I want to do is hide away. I know this is not normal but right now I have to hide, hiding feels normal. I know I am in a hole but everyone is telling me to move ahead slowly. I just want to stay here..not move and cry. I am hoping people on here have felt the same.

Last year my sister decided to take her life, leaving behind a newborn behind.
It's been over half a year and I don't think I have made any progress with feeling, understanding or processing what has happened.
Of late, there have been waves of confusion and disbelief. Which I can know can be expected, but it doesn't make it any easier.
The husbands family have been open and welcoming with us to come and visit, spending time with baby, which we deeply appreciate.
It's with the tiny moments in between everything that I find to be most confronting. That feeling that we, as family to the child, play a disconnected role, one that feels like distant cousins that show up once a year, with no real influence or care for the child. With attempts at feeding, changing or taking a more active role sometimes brushed to the side or overseen.
 I guess I can see it's still early days, and that the husband and family are clutching onto baby as it's all he has left, but what about us?
Baby is our only connection to who we have lost. What are the politics and processes for such a complicated situation?
What I see immediately is that we need to saturate, just to get close and make the impression that we are here, and we want a more active role.

Hello.
sorry I'm a new member and if I've posted this in the wrong place, moderators please feel free to remove this.
I lost a best friend three months ago due to suicide, unfortunately I found him after he had taken his life. 
I live in a small community and the support I've received is amazing but I'm yet to open up about how I'm feeling, simply because I don't know how to feel. I've completely avoided coming to terms with what has happened and I've put all my energy into making sure everyone else around me is dealing with it.
recently another close friend has been self harming and the thought of losing her is keeping me awake at night. It's draining me. 
my question is, has anyone got any advice or tips that'll help me get back to my normal self. I know it won't be an easy process but I need to do something. 
 I'm sorry if I've triggered or offended anyone. 
Thank you.

Well Im feeling really down and depressed and my mind has been so focused on the one thing today its starting to make my head spin. You see today would have been my beautiful Dads Birthday he would have been 91 years old, but sadly he passed away 6 years ago. My Dad was my best friend we used to have the best conversations about all kinds of things,we made wonderful memories together, but it breaks my heart I miss him so much, I still talk to him in my mind daily, I have photos of him all around the house, I remember he used to double me on his mobility scooter.
So as hard a day its been for me I've just tried to relive the good times
I was with him when he passed away and we got to tell each other how much we loved each other
So rest in peace my beautiful Dad and Happy Birthday
Love Annie

I wasn't sure where to post about this. It didn't seem to fit in any of the categories 
 i recently lost my dog in a tragic accident. He was much more than a dog to me he was everything. I am single and live alone, he was my whole life. He gave my life purpose for the first time.
I rescued him from a horrible life and we only had 4 and a half short months together. He made me so incredibly happy, happier than I have ever been I have never loved anyone or anything the way that I loved him. I'm just hurting so much. Constantly feeling like I don't want to live without him and fighting so hard to keep going. 
 i have so much support around me but it just isn't helping. I feel lost and empty and I just don't know how to cope 
 i have always had depression and right now I just feel like I am at rock bottom. I can't even function, even though I have sought professional help from a doctor and a psychologist. I'm struggling so much

After reading a post in the Dr Kim's section and the scriber was talking about a colleague committing suicide after losing their job. They spoke about writing a letter to the employer about things that were going on, also policy/procedures issues and should they be afraid of losing their job.
I feel making issues relating to policy and procedure is vital for a company, it is great to make improvements for employers and employees. If it could be done in a manner where there is no finger pointing or blame even better. I feel if i was going to write a letter like this, i feel it could be more beneficial done by a group of staff representatives so they know how staff are feeling on certain issues. Talk to other employees to gather other feedback on the issues you are going to put forward to your employer.
It is a very sad thing to lose someone you know or work with to suicide and my believe is that we as a whole need to be more in tune to how people present at different times also approaching someone if they seem out of character. If employers are not this way the employees could create an environment that is made to feel people could approach others before things become too heavy for them.
What are others opinion on this subject?

I lost my dad last year and the 1 year of his fathers is creeping up and I'm feeling more and more anxious. I don't want to work, see people or even get out of bed at times. I'm struggling and over eating, not exercising much and self doubting myself constantly. I recently got work and then stopped due to feeling I couldn't do it. I just want to feel normal again. The only thing keeping me going is my dog and new partner.¬†

I am really struggling to cope with the loss of my beautiful Grandpa's. My Paternal Pop passed away in April and my Maternal Pop in June. They were both living with me and my family at the time and gained their wings as they slept, which has compounded my grief. I am trying to focus on the fact they have both reunited with their soul mates, my beautiful Nana's, but it only provides so much comfort.
The constant talk of their estates and the knowledge that their houses will be sold by years end and most likely knocked down makes me feel I have lost them all, all over again. It nearly broke me the first time.
With us recently having our first Father's Day with out them, and various heartbreaking days ahead; their birthdays coming up in November and December, the anniversaries, especially the 7 month anniversary of my Paternal Pop's passing (which happens to fall on the 17 year anniversary of my Paternal Nana's passing and the 5 month anniversary of the day we laid my Maternal Pop to rest), our first Christmas without them and our last at my Paternal Grandparents home and then starting the new year, with them in heaven instead of here with us.
It is all too much.
We aren't just dealing with our grief though; my parents, older sister and I are all dealing with health issues, my father is going through legal proceedings with work (from which he retired 2 years ago), my brother is living at our Grandparents house and is dealing with having to find a new home and I lost my job in May.
I want to be there for them through everything but I can't even help myself. I feel so alone and am struggling to hold it together.
I love my Grandparents so much and miss them beyond words.

Hi, I am new here. 
 Two weeks ago I lost my dear friend and mentor, my Grandmother. We were incredibly close and I had been heavily involved in her care until she passed. Before the funeral I just felt like a robot- going through all the processes, supporting my dad, helping with funeral arrangements. After the funeral, it hit me really hard and now I don't know what to do. I am still incredibly upset but it's like no one cares anymore, as in, now the funeral is over the grieving is meant to be finished?? Or I'm meant to be 'over it'? 
I don't know what is normal. I think about her almost every minute, I choke up at the thought I can never see her again. I am holding it all in as I feel like no one wants to hear it anymore. 
I don't know what to do.

Hi,Almost two weeks ago my father committed suicide.I spent the first couple of days tearing everything apart trying to find answers to questions that werent always important; finding out his last movements, if it was planned for some time.I accepted a lot of the questions werent important and i let them go.There was a lot of family drama i was caught between up until the funeral. During the funeral, i barely shed a tear and i feel like i just dont care. In my head i know he is gone but im not sure i know that in my body. Im really confused by how i feel.I considered viewing the body but chose not to, but now i think it may have helped me?Will it come out eventually? How will itt come out? Any information would be appreciated.

A few weeks ago my brothers fience died. He move back home with us (parents and I),and im feeling overwhelmed.
I've  been suffering major depression for 15 years; I'm agoraphobic, have social anxiety, and schizotypal PD. I'm a loner, highly sensitive to exteral stimulus (sounds, sights, smells etc.). I need complete isolation in order to unwind, which I usually have my own space. But now my brother has moved in and I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown. 
 I don't want to take away from his loss but I am not coping. I'm becoming snappish, highly agitated and relying on anti anxietys too much. 
My parents are under huge stess, they're picking up the slack for everything. I can't add to that. But i am not coping. 
How do I tell my grieving brother to leave me alone and get out of my personal space?

This is my first post. 
Today I discovered my friend took his life two days ago. He had been battling for a while with custody issues with his ex wife. He's seen his kids a total of 2 days this year.  I guess it got too much for him. 
As we'd both been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts, we made a pact that we'd call each other if either of us got to that dark place.  He didn't call.
I'm feeling a range of things but one emotion that concerns me is envy. I find myself wishing I had the courage to go through with it. 
I know I need help but I don't know what to say. I've had counselling but I'm very hard on myself and tend to scoff at people trying to justify my feelings. I don't know what I'm expecting but just thought I should put something out there.

I lost my little brother 6 years ago at the age of 17 to suicide. The only thing we know about the reasons why, is all hearsay. No notes, signs or anything. I do think anything he use to do, as a family we related that to possibilities of why he done it. It is still a touchy subject in my family so obviously I can't talk to family about it in full detail. Unanswered questions have been just as constant in my mind to this day. I now have children but I can't fully be focused on them because I'm always thinking about my brother. I know I'm a good mum but I'm not giving my kids 100% I'd say I'm giving them 90% of my all. Which is unfair. I tried harming myself 3 days after his death. I stopped because I was too scared. No one ever knew or knows. I went back to my family and we continued with our farewells to him. I've struggled with my weight since his death and I feel so much more depressed when weight has piled on. I don't know how to control my weight now. There is still blame and confusion on my part. It's been 6 years of having this in my head. I'm appreciative to have finally let this out. Thank you for reading.

On 22nd July my Dad knocked my Mum with the car in their drive, she hit her head & died the next morning.  I KNOW it was an accident, but feel guilty that I ""let"" my Dad still be driving at 87 (he was cleared by a Dr to drive two weeks prior) My hubby and I were 300km from home for a much-needed break (I was feeling depressed) We got ""the phone call"" & drove home immediately, half way home we got a call saying there was no hope, Mum would certainly die.  My heart broke, ""not my beautiful Mum"" My sister (who usually lives 400km away) happened to be up, was on her way home actually when she got a call Mum had managed to dial, she called an ambulance & saw Mum just as she was leaving, she was conscious then, by the time my sis got to hospital Mum had lost consciousness, she never woke again.  I live less than 2km from Mum and Dad and keep thinking ""what if I hadn't been away"" ""at least I would have had the chance to talk to her, if only for a minute.
Mum was my best friend; I spoke to her at least once every day and saw her at least three times a week.  She & Dad shared much of our lives. Mum and I had a lot in common, she was my support person.  She said little about how my Dad's memory was failing but it was obvious that it was becoming a problem.  I told her how worried I was about her dying first and what to do about Dad, he and I were not close, okay but not close
My Dad's dementia has spiralled since her death, he can't be left alone, cries a lot & is very difficult; cantankerous, even aggressive.  I have done all those ""things"" you have to do when someone dies; undoing my Mum's life file number by licence number was hard!. I try to stay ""up"" to counter Dad's ""down"" and he accuses me of not caring.... when I am home alone I am in pieces.  I am now my Dad's PoA and running his house as well as ours & our business.  My sis (retired) is staying with him for now; her home and partner are too far away for it to continue long term.  We can afford a nice nursing home, but he is very resistant.  Also I KNOW that once he is in a place, my sis will go home and the visiting and care (Dr visits etc) will all fall to me, & I've done more than my""share"" over the years, 
I am saddest that I can't grieve for Mum with all the worry and ""doing"" for Dad taking my time & energy... I am sad too that I resent my Father for being so needy, I know it's unreasonable but when he says it would be best that he die all I can think is, ""it would"" or if I did.. I am very down

I am being slammed by complex grief.My father was an extremely abusive man, a depressed narcissist in fact that terrorised his wife and kids.He took his own life 6 years ago.My grief has been protracted because life wasn't polite and didn't give me space to grieve straight away like other people can. I had to hold up my traumatised Mum who has a psychotic illness, quit my job, leave my friends to ensure she didn't go the same way. When I was little I was certain it would be her to do it - but I was wrong.12 months later our Nana died. And then 9 months later Mum's best friend died, who was my ""earth mother"" that looked after me when I was little whenever Mum was hospitalised. Everyone was gone.I am haunted by my fathers death. Haunted.He was so abusive.............................but he was my Dad.

I miss my father in law.  He represented the goodness and humanity of a man who encouraged community.  He reminds me that Father's Day is about good men.  His son, my husband is also an exceptional man and a wonderful father.  He has survived and endures living with me and my ongoing fight with my past.  I struggle to get through Father's Day, but I suck in my grief for my wonderful husband and our incredible children.  I see them and am reminded that I must focus on the beauty of life now as it should be.  But I am miserable and I am furious. In the 10 years my husband has been a father, he knows of my struggle and that just ruins his day.  He lost his dad 6 years ago and that just ruins his day.  I have let him be cheated of what is rightfully his, what he has truly earned.  A wonderful and meaningful Father's Day.  I am sickened and revolted by thoughts that my childhood rape gave a paedophile 11 Father's Day's.  I am heartbroken for the beautiful people in my life who are affected by the pain that I let out and I hate myself so much for letting my past affect those I love.  I realize now that I can't move on because I don't know where he is and it angers me that he continues to celebrate Father's Day.  Why is he not dead?  Why do I let him ruin Father's Day for my beautiful gentle husband? How do I push all his ugly aside and make space for someone who truly deserves it?  Help me

I don't want sympathy but I feel like I haven't had the easiest of lives! There is a family history of depression and I have also lost a sister to cancer, my father to suicide, a child who was stilborn, a brother in a road accident and a very close friend to cancer. The last two within the last two months! I am a firm believer in life goes on (not in a heartless way) but sometimes I feel like I should be cut some slack! My husband seems so cold, like I just make excuses for not cleaning! I believe I am depressed but I have been like this my whole life, on and off medication, so I just keep doing what needs to be done... I finally found a job that I look forward. I'm not perfect! I'm not the most motivated person but I think I do my best... I don't even know what I am asking, I just wish I had someone who understood that I'm not lazy! I'm just tired! I'm tired of losing people! I'm tired of being afraid of talking about it because I think people will think I'm fishing for sympathy or not believe me.. I Just wish he knew... Thank you

Hi all,
My father passed away nearly 4 weeks ago, we had been estranged for well over 15 years, with the last time we actually spoke being a negative experience for us both. I was told by a family member 2 days before he passed away that he was not doing well and had been moved to palliative care. It was at this point that I decided to go see him before he passed on, as he had no other family around him (he wasn't known for maintaining relationships) and I didn't want him to pass on without saying my goodbyes. I drove the 3 hours from my home to where has was, the drive seemed like an eternity with a million things rushing through my head, as well as emotions I didn't expect to feel given the time that had passed and the relationship we had. I stayed with him at the hospital until he passed away from lung and heart failure. Witnessing a man who was also so strong struggle to breathe, was definitely the most confronting and overwhelming thing I have ever done in my life. Even now I'm still feelings overwhelmed but still somewhat numb by seeing that.The numbness finally gave way to sadness, further complicated by the fact he had to will, no funeral plan etc. I am the youngest of 4 children, 3 (including myself) are still alive, I was left to handle everything from trying to sort out his financial and legal obligations to making the funeral arrangements and paying for them also. I have received nothing but abuse from one of my older siblings for doing all of the above, meanwhile no one else was doing anything.
So needless to say, the death of my father has caused a lot of grief, sadness and massive feelings of being overwhelmed. Just when I think I am going okay with everything, I often feel this crushing weight of emotions that I can't even begin to describe. I know it is very early days but please someone tell me if gets easier. I feel broken on a daily basis.

Hi all,
 I would consider myself a mentally well adjusted person in general. I lost my father who lives overseas to a sudden cardiac arrest on July 16th of this year. I went home for the funeral, and to help mum sort out his affairs, and came back to australia about three weeks after that. I was very close to my father (I was his first born and a daddy's girl), and losing him at the age of 66 (I am 32) was crap. No other way to put it. After the initial horrible crying all the time of the first three weeks, I tried to pull myself together and sunk myself into work and the gym, rather than wallowing in it. I have a dog and found that walking him was very therapeutic. My partner is from country vic and a bit of a blokes bloke, so I know that emotional support can be limited.
 Last night, as I was putting clothes away in our bedroom, I saw a jumper of dads. It just hit me then, and I couldnt control the tears. I quickly went to my office as I didn't want to bawl in front of my partner, I am pretty private in general with this, even with him. I had a good cry and went back to the bedroom where he was reading the news in bed, but couldnt shake the feeling of sadness. I said to my partner that I was feeling shit, and that I missed my father, and that I tried not to be a debbie downer by going and crying it out in my office but I still couldnt shake it. He looked at me and said ""you have been a debbie downer for the last 3 months, I'm tired of your shit. First world problems, you need to get over it, theres people with bigger problems!"" 
I was aghast. He stabbed his finger at me as he talked, his face contorted. He had bigger problems than me he said, but when I asked him what they were he told me that he wouldn't tell me as I was useless! Then he stomped off to the spare bedroom.
 So here I am. I'm being told to get over my fathers death like its the death of a cat, and I have a partner who is a dickhead. I feel shit. Just writing it all out to get it out. Thanks for reading.

Nick died tragically early in January 2015. He was 22 years of age. Nick was part of the usual less than perfect family; with brothers, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends and various others who loved and confused him with equal measure.As a child Nick was diagnosed as having ADHD and later this was clarified as Asperger's syndrome. This meant that Nick's experience of the world was more confusing than for most of us, as the analytical stream of his brain and the emotional stream were less interconnected.He was to experience learning difficulties, his parents' divorce, his mother dying much too soon, having to take what work might be offered and various tribulations of life.Nick had a powerful memory. Before he started school he could name each of the Thomas-The-Tank-Engines. But while he could place one or two of his toy trains away in his toy box, when faced with too many he was unable to comprehend a solution. As an adolescent Nick mastered catching after back-flipping at trapeze.He had abundant patience, which he drew on when working as a personal care attendant. He cooked meals for his brothers and father. Nick enjoyed drawing, as did his grandfather and great-grandfather who shared a family curse of depression. Nick could be maddening to live with; he might tidy up but not completely, staying up late and expressing decided opinions. He often preferred activities that were familiar, with people he knew; especially his brothers and cousins.He joined a drawing group at a burlesque club, and few months ago went to the Russian Film Festival, with musicians, dancers, vodka shots and pretty girls. Nick had sought medical advice on his own initiative about the increased anxiety he was experiencing. He took the prescription medication he was prescribed. He accepted a referral to a clinical psychologist and did not miss any appointments.Nick had also enrolled in a TAFE course in bakery. He had not been shy about early hours, hard work.We cannot know what was in Nick's mind on the evening he died and why he so hastened into this good night. His family is earnestly reflected on how we might have better supported Nick.Nick is buried with his mother.Breichiau mam sy'n dynn amdanat(Mother's arms are tight around you).

Hi all,
14th of July 2015 , my best friend in this world died. My mum was 66yrs old. We found out in December 2014 two weeks before Xmas that she had cancer. I thought that was the worst day of my life, but when she got an appointment with the oncologist in late January 2015 we were told it was terminal . She did chemo to buy some time but I feel it didn't really help. I took care of her and never left her side,I was so distraught at the prospect of her dying. I cried every single day ,I  tried to be strong but couldn't. Eventually it went to her brain an no more treatment was an option,so she was sent home to die.we had hospice come in when needed. I watched the woman that I loved with every fibre of my being die .
I'm 42 years old and I'm severely agarophobic along with other anxiety issues. My brother is 45 and schizophrenic and we both live in our family home. We have no other family, my father has never been part of our lives even tho he is alive and well. In February this year I had a heart attack and was in hospital for three days,the same hospital I spent so much time at with my mum. I begged them to let me die if I had another heart attack, I just want to be with my mum. They sent a psychiatrist to see me in hospital and diagnosed me with major depressive disorder. I feel so alone even tho I know others are going through the same. I am a mess and truly wish everyday I could join my mum.
Thanks for listening.

Hi, I lost my mum suddenly to a heart attack a year ago and I was actually the one to find her in bed. She had been gone for a couple of hours which even in my shock I could comprehend, but regardless I had to follow the 000 instructions and attempt to resuscitate her until the ambulance arrived. I'm obviously grieving but it's the trauma of this event that is what I find most disturbing. I have the normal things that obviously trigger sad emotions... Anniversarys, birthdays etc but I find that it takes me back to resuscitating her, seeing her lifeless body, not to the loving, joyful memories of her and my child hood. I just relive the emotions of that day. Has anyone else been through something similar? Is this normal? It still haunts me and I think I need to talk about it more. Sometimes it builds up and I end up having an emotional purge... ie: crying/sobbing for hours until I'm exhausted and fall asleep. I do have a loving support network around me but I'm still traumatised by this. I'd like to better understand what's happening to me, maybe if anyone else has experianced this or similar it may help knowing I'm not thinly one. Maybe there's some good advice out there? I hope so.

I recently lost my mom who I was very close to. We were best friends and shared a lifetime of experiences. Losing her is the toughest experience I have ever had to face. If it was that alone I know I would eventually learn to live with her loss but for now it is very raw. To complicate my journey I am trying to cope with my husband who had been suffering depression for a long time and has not been able to provide much support. Because of his illness we have almost no friends and family rarely visit. He refuses all help and rarely tells me what he is thinking. I can't lean on him as my not coping is making him worse. I feel quite trapped.

Hi all, 
I have never posted in anything like this before but i just really need to pour my heart out. 
I lost my beautiful sister 8 weeks ago. She was 31. She died suddenly due to an accident. We were extremely close and spoke multiple times a day. We shared everything and she is a huge part of who i am. 
I replay the morning she died over and over in my head. I will never forget it. 
I miss her terribly. I ache for her. I don't want to get out of bed anymore. I cry all day. I think of her constantly. I don't know how to live without her. 
She didnt want to die. I feel so awful for her.  She would be devasted this happened to her. I want to protect her and i can't. I should of prevented this happening somehow. She was too important to be gone. 
I have 3 kids and i go through the motions every day but i have lost the best part of me. I feel sick that i am young and have to live through this for a long time. It cant be real. 
I talk to her all day. I write to her constantly. Of course she never responds. So many things we shared. So many things that only she would understand. ...its all lost. 
No one loves me like she does. No one understands me like she does. I just want this pain to go away and for her to speak to me. 
I dont know what to do anymore.

Hi all,
 I lost my fiancee on our Wedding Day  Feb 2015 before we were married, we were both 24 at the time. Flash forward 18 months and I'm back at work doing well, I have friends and family who love me, but I feel so lost and don't know how to talk to anyone about it. I'm lonely and sad and find it hard to relate to anyone my own age in and out of relationships as I don't know anyone my age who has been through the same thing as me. I feel like I have to be strong too, it's just part of who I am, but I am sick of being strong... I suppose I am looking for someone to relate to, someone who understands... 
Happy and open to talk.. any help would be appreciated.
 Thank you in advance

Aurora Jane mason: not one day has gone by that I haven't thought of you. I remember the day before you were born I was a total mess stressing over everything and nothing, people were telling me that this will be the most memorable moment of my life! hearing your own baby girl cry out for the first time.
So six years ago today daddy finished work and rushed to meet you and mummy at the hospital, full of pride for the first time I was so excited too meet you. 
But the entire floor was quite when I got there and all I could hear were heartbroken cries and tears,still born is what they told me. Daddy is so sorry he wasn't there, daddy is so sorry that he never got too hear your first scream, daddy is sorry he didn't have the strength to stay in the hospital with you and mum and ran off! 
I will always remember your ethereal face though my baby for the rest of my life! And your life which was taken from you will continue to play out in my dreams... It is the price I pay for living while you are no longer here.
Love always and forever Dad xox

3 weeks ago my family and I lost my dad to cancer after a 2 year battle. My mum was his primary carer and also my absolute hero. Seeing him in so much pain was terrible but his passing has given us some comfort he is no longer in pain. I live alone but spent several weeks with my family. Now I am back home and getting back into work it literally does not feel real. I feel like I don't cry enough. I do have some moments where I break down but then soon after I feel better. It seems to come in waves. Living alone with not much of a social life is hard, and I do spend as much time with my family during this time but also understand we need our own space too. This is the first time I have experienced loss.

Hi,
I am new to forums and this is my first ever post. I'm not sure what I am hoping for but two years ago I lost my mum very quickly and unexpectedly. Then in January this year mum's husband passed away. His death stired up the loss of mum again and I thought losing mum was the hardest lost I would ever have to endure - I was wrong! Five weeks after my stepfather died my son passed away. That phone call was my worse nightmare coming true and after the autopsy to find out his death could have been prevented if the people he was staying with would have called for medical assistance makes it all that much worse. I am trying to find a balance with my youngest son, I am trying to not smother him but I don't want him to feel as though I am not always there for him either. Myself, I am totally lost and can't find any enthusiasm to do anything and have been off work since my son died. If anyone has gone through something similar or even lost a child, I could really use any words of wisdom. I feel like I'm in a downward spiral and can't seem to get a grip on my way down. I know my life has changed forever and I am not ever going to be the same person but I don't know how to get through this. My children have always been my life.

Hi everyone,This is my very first post here. I decided to come here, because i feel so lost right now. I literally feel numb, i cry all the time, i can't sleep properly.A little about my background: I was diagnosed with severe depression in November 2010, and was on medication. I felt fine, and i believe that it was really helping me to recover. However, i found out that i was pregnant in Feb 2011. I had to stop my anti-d's due to high risk of heart defects in the baby. So i stopped, and i managed to cope somehow.After she was born, i was fine. Fast forward to 2013, we became pregnant with our second. My world came crashing down when our 12 week test came back as positive for trisomy 21 (downs). We decided not to terminate, and we waited until our baby was born. She was born without trisomy 21.It's now 2016, and we decided to start trying for our 3rd baby in late 2015. We fell pregnant in march 2016, and had all the usual tests. All was good. I had my first scan on April the 1st, and they discovered a molar pregnancy. I had a d&c on April the 4th, and I've been having weekly blood tests since then to measure my beta hcg levels. They found a 12 week old baby when the d&c was performed, we thought we were only 7 weeks along; so we decided to cremate the baby.With a molar pregnancy, you need to have regular tests to make sure the hcg levels are coming down. If not, it can be a sign of retained tissue, persistent gestational trophoblastic disease (which needs chemo) or choriocarcinoma (Spreads to the lungs, and other organs. also needs chemo)So not only had we lost our baby, we found out that our baby was older; and we also had a risk of developing cancer. Losing your baby is bad enough, let alone finding out that you may have cancer.My levels were dropping like they were meant to, until may the 1st. From 979 they jumped to 2800, on may the 9th they jumped to 8,000. I'm devastated, i just want to feel better again; be better again. I feel like with everything that has been going on, I've not had a chance to grieve properly.I feel angry. Angry that the d&c was done blindly (not with ultrasound, due to not being ""cost effective""), upset that i'll probably have to go in for surgery again. Frustrated with my body. I can't look at a baby, or be around one without getting upset. I don't want to go to family events, because people in the family are trying for babies. It's like a slap in the face, a reminder of what i lost.

Hello everyone. 
 First, i'm so sincerely sorry for the pain you feel/have felt/continue to feel at the loss of a loved one and the fallout (with family) that seems to follow. I've read a a few threads and for the first time in many weeks feel like I am amongst people to truly understand what its like.
 I lost my mom very suddenly on the 10th of April. My parents live overseas and I saw her in December - she seemed well at the time. When I rushed back home in April things were very different. She had an emergency surgery that hadnt gone well, she was on life support and heavily sedated for the pain. We lost her a week later without ever having had a chance to say goodbye. The guilt I feel for not being there for her in her last conscious moments is extreme. Having to leave my father all by himself was no less difficult. 
 My husband has been incredibly supportive, as have many close friends but no one has experienced grief or loss - most times I feel there is an expectation that I will ""shrug it off"" and feel better. I sometimes feel that I am failing to do what is expected of me. And, I'm having real trouble with my in-laws. My husband's mother and sister expect me to be normal - becuause I lived away from my mom and only saw her infrequently they think I couldnt possibly have cared for her very much and dont understand when I am sad to have lost her. When my husband has tried to explain my need to distance myself from them for a while (because who can take the feeling of being judged and found wanting when they are at their lowest point?) they have retaliated and said that I'm a bad influence on the family and that I am taking my husband away from them. 
 I'm floored by it all. Up until my mother's death I've had an amicable relationship with my in-laws; we've helped each other out often. So I dont understand why they seem to have turned on me. I dont know if I'm over-reacting or whether I've done something wrong by them. 
My mother was an incredibly strong woman - I miss her encouragement and support every day. I feel so let down by the people I thought would help me through her loss. 
 What can I do?

Dear Mum
¬†
You were always there for me.
¬†
Through thick and thin and wow we sure had some troubles.
¬†
When I was so young, the amount of times I cried for you when you had to leave the hospital that I was in;¬† you left and headed off in the dark, to catch a bus to where your parents lived.
¬†
So many trips to Sydney back and forth, for operations, for check-ups ‚Äì all to see how my lip was recovering and determining for when the next operation would be.¬† 10 operations in all ‚Äì can‚Äôt count the amount of trips to Sydney;¬† but you were there with me every step of the way.
¬†
You also had those two awful bouts of breast cancer, together with all the treatment.
¬†
Then Dad with his two heart operations ‚Äì for the 2nd one, I went to Sydney to be with you (and Dad) .
¬†
Every time Dad was admitted to hospital, you‚Äôd be there with him, by his bed-side.
¬†
In 1991, you had to bury your beloved son ‚Äì which I know you (we) never got over;¬† how could we?¬†¬† Something just impossible to do and from that tragedy, that killed off so much within all of us.¬† Your son, my brother ‚Äì there could have been 2 drownings that day, but oh no, I was able to save myself, but I couldn‚Äôt save my best mate, my bro;¬† drowned at the age of 29.¬† Yet you never blamed me, you always stood by me and tried your best to make sure I was ok.¬† I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äì but then, neither were you (or Dad).
¬†
Move to 2007 and we lost Dad to leukaemia ‚Äì and you were then without your life partner; your soul mate ‚Äì Dad.
¬†
You were a beautiful couple.¬† I cannot ever recall a fight between the two of you ‚Äì Dad the laid-back farmer, and you were his wonderful wife, our wonderful Mum, who had to struggle through farm hardships and never having much money, but as kids, we didn‚Äôt want for nothing.
¬†
Mum, it‚Äôs coming up to a year since you‚Äôve gone.¬† 365 days;¬† almost what they call a year in our human existence ‚Äì that you‚Äôve no longer been with us.¬† I cannot tell you the amount of times during this time that I have wanted to call you, to talk to you, to say ‚Äúhi‚Äù, to see ‚Äúhow you are‚Äù?
¬†
I write this now with tears streaming down my face. 
¬†
I miss you Mum.
¬†
I want to ring you ‚Äì I want to say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù and I want to tell you I love you.¬† But I can‚Äôt do that and I will never be able to do that again.
¬†
I just feel so sad and empty.
¬†
I love you Mum ‚Äì I will love you forever.
¬†
I miss you Mum and I will never ever stop missing you.

There is usually sympathy given when someone loses a loved one but in my case my husband is still alive but we have lost the way of life we previously had. I have had to stop work to care for him. He is blind so going to a movie, playing card or board games no longer work. We used to enjoy camping, exploring & hiking but now I do all the driving, navigating , packing, setting up camp, cooking cleaning etc so going away is no long the relaxing holiday it was. When walking I am on alert for obstacles such as over hanging branches etc that his cane won't pick up & the more adventurous walks are too difficult to manage. Planning holidays results in disappointments because every one planned over the last 18mths has been foiled by illness or injury. i also miss having his support to do daily tasks Have others dealt with this.

I received a call on the 9/2/16, from my dad saying mum was in hospital. Who would have known less than 24hrs later we would have to turn off life support. Mum went into complete kidney and liver failure over night and her organs just shut down on her, my Aunty and myself refused to leave her side, the Drs said there was nothing they could do for her so at 9.55am on the 10/2/16 my father, sisters, aunts and uncle and our children stood around her hospital bed as she passed away 5 mins later. Mum was only 61. We could not cremate her for 9 days due to a autopsy having to be performed. Coroner has been unable to find a cause of death, we have been told it could be a year before we know. Since she died I have had to organise a funeral, then pack up a house that has 20yrs of memories and help my dad move my two sisters are fighting so no help from them. Dad had to move as its to hard for him. When I was going through the house I came across hand written notes that give me the impression that mum knew she was sick and dying. It rips my heart out to think that she had to go through all of that on her own it must have been the most terrifying experience and It eats at me daily that she couldn't tell me, or felt she needed to keep it to herself. I feel like a failure of a daughter. Nothing anyone says makes a difference üòû

Hi, i recentley lost my friend Daniel to suicide. We used to date back when we were 16. We bonded over music and we always had a great laugh together, we got along easily. He returned to my life six months ago and we fell in love. He was recently out of a marriage and wanted to slow down. We ended up having a chaotic few months as i wanted to date and he didnt. Finally things came together and we began to make plans to start dating. He was having trouble with his ex wife and the parenting of his kids and committed suicide after leaving me an angry voicemail saying i had caused him nothing but pain. After that i lost contact with him and suffered a nervous breakdown/pshycotic episode and was hospitalized. When i was discharged i called him and his best mate to see what had happened and he said he had committed suicide. Im struggling with the loss as we would have such a great time together when we hung out and i saw him as my future. He was the closest id come to love and a relationship since the breakdown of my marriage and i feel alone and wonder how will i ever meet somebody else. I feel isolated and sad that i lost such a great person and old friend.

Hello, 
 I have a client whose dad passed away 5 months ago and he is struggling to emotionally regulate and vocalize his emotions. He tried to attend just a kids camp (nothing specializes) but got sent home due to his disengagement and non compliance to camp rules. Is there any kids/teen camps that might be more suitable for what his going through in Perth, WA?

Hi, 
I feel so ridiculous. A friend of mine, not that close.... but still. Took his own life yesterday. He was 28.
So talented, so good looking, such potential. I'm nearly twice as old as him and have done maybe half as much. It is so senseless. I don't know the details of how it happened. There is an enormous outpouring of emotion on Social Media. I am myself depressed about other issues in my life, I have two similarly aged young adult children.
My tears for this young man seem so disproportionate. There is nothing I could have done I think, I really don't know. I regret not appreciating the small interactions that I had with him. I wish that this were a joke or some fantasy story that is not the reality.
It's very sad. I don't know how to get past this. So much grief flows through my entire life. ( Sounds so pretentious)
I didn't want to put these thoughts on other online media, because of the disproportionality. It is a kind of letter to the young man and Cosmos of how I'm thinking.

I am a sufferer of depression and anxiety (GAD). I am very well now, after a long journey through many treatments and like to think I live a very fulfilling, happy life and keep my wellbeing in check. I absolutely credit my great place to my partner who has been nothing but amazing for the entire time, and been right there by my side where others have not throughout my mental health challenges.
 Recently, my partner lost his father suddenly to cancer. I have found myself in a position where I now need to be the absolute rock for my partner as he goes through this, whilst also dealing with the grief and processing the situation myself. I have found this especially hard on my mental health, where before I have felt like I can call out a bad day- considering everything he is going through I don't want to pile anything else on him. 
 I wanted to see if anyone else who has mental health challenges has been in a similar situation and has any advice on how best to manage not only the wellbeing of my best friend and partner, but myself?

Yesterday was a horrible day... went to work , turned on the radio and the DJ was talking about someone receiving an email from his father after his father had passed.. as he read the email it sounded word for word what dad would say to me... they cut to a song and it was one of dads that we played at his funeral.. this got me going to the bathroom for a cry (thank god I work alone some days)..busy day seeing clients and helping them.. the only quite moment during the day I have another song came on the radio that was a song that ment a lot to the family that he sung a lot...spent all that night having dreams about him.. today I am seeing a new client with her parents only to find out that the clients mum is a nurse and helped dad whilst he was in hospital.. she couldn't stop crying telling me how sorry she was.. 
I normally walk each morning to help reduce my stress. I stopped when dad passed unable to find the energy and started again over the weekend...But over the last two days these seems to be making it harder as I think its bring back the grief.. its been two months since his passing and I have been ok and at peace with his passing normally walking helps me for my mental state and listing to music help me remember him in a good way and not pulling at the heart strings.. but not this week.. do I walk through it or find a new exercise to be my stress relief

My siblings haven't been in contact with me since they each married 30-40 years ago. I'm now middle aged, both my parents have died, and my fianc√© after which I felt like I went through a nervous breakdown, the new career I'd spent 3 years studying for collapsed into a heap before I could finish. While my fianc√© died 9 years ago and was really the catalyst, the grief of losing my mum returned and has remained raw. It's contributed to my social phobia coming back. I find other people talking about their family too painful to bear and keeping me isolated. No one understands the pain of having no family, or none that want to know you.  I wish I could hit a delete button on some of my emotions! and develop a thick skin. I've wondered about rewriting my 'story' for the purpose of answering all the polite 'get to know you questions'. Only people with similar lived experiences get it, I really need to know how other people cope.

On this day 36 years ago my life changed irrevocably. I became alone in the world. Without warning my mother had a
severe stroke and a few hours later the machine that was keeping her body alive was turned off. Meanwhile at home, my terminally ill father 
who‚Äôs mind had long ago left his body had no idea that his wife and carer for so many hard years had left this mortal coil. Later in the 
afternoon he was taken to hospital and after pulling many strings I had him admitted into a fine nursing home to live out his last few years 
oblivious of this harsh new reality. Call me cruel for those actions but first think hard about it. 
¬†
I have now been alone for so long. No brothers, sisters, cousins, no one at all and a failed marriage but fortunately no children.For those of you that have ‚Äúfamily‚Äù cherish every moment. If you don‚Äôt speak or even acknowledge a relation for whatever reason, they are still there. They are still on this planet and deep down in your subconscious th0e link is not broken. Take a moment to reflect on the Christmases, 
birthdays and those many events that give the word ‚Äúfamily‚Äù real meaning. Whether it‚Äôs good or bad  believe me, the alternative is an 
emptiness that in time makes you sour to so many things, believe me, I know.
I didn‚Äôt write this for sympathy. I didn‚Äôt write this to cry ‚Äúwhy me?‚Äù I wrote this to remind you to take a moment to think about your respective
families, of who you have in your life and how they may have helped to shape you into the wonderful people you are.

In 2011 my mum was killed in a hit and run whilst on holidays in Qld. She lived in the same town as me in Vic. My dad was up there too but wasn't riding with her that day. The shock was massive and my life just plummeted into a dark hole. I was basically crippled socially. I didn't want to see anyone for a very long time. I thought everyone was going to die so what was the point in having friends? Every time I drove my car, every vehicle I passed I would think ""Is this the one that will veer into my lane and kill me?"" I was always waiting to be hit and killed. I cried all the time and panicked if I was in any social situation. I had no social life for years because of it. It will be 5 years this Sept and I am only just starting to enjoy going to dinner with my friends instead of avoiding it. I was and am a single mother and my daughter pretty much had to fend for herself for much of the first year. There is nothing I can do about it now, but for my own knowledge, I am wondering if it is possible that the shock led to PTSD? I have never considered it until I heard someone speaking about it and thought, that sounds like I was until very recently...

I'm new to this forum and I don't even know what I want from this, but I'm just lost.
October last year I lost my mum, very suddenly. A healthy woman who has never had more than a cold, contracted bacterial meningitis and in a matter of days, she could not fight it anymore and it took her. She was 61, and loving life.
I guess there are a few factors that make this harder for me, she lived in the UK, along with all my family, as that's where I am originally from. I didn't get there in time to see her. I had to wait for my then 4 month old baby's passport. I landed in the UK and went straight into organizing her funeral. She never met my son, it was her first grandchild. We had flights booked to go to the UK that January as we wanted to wait until he was 6 months. She missed my entire journey from being pregnant, labour and meeting him and seeing me as a Mother.¬†
On the outside I seem like I am dealing with it, I have a son that needs taking care of. But I'm broken inside and don't know what to do. I am normally a strong independent person and I've become this fragile nervous mess. This is not how I want to be.¬†
I organised to see a counselor, but I've been once and then they didn't have availability for another month so I'm still waiting to go again which I feel like it's had a really negative effect. I'm not religious, and have no beliefs as to what happens when you die so I'm really struggling to find peace anywhere.¬†

Soon to be one year ago I lost my ex-boyfriend/boyfriend to suicide, I have a lot of pain and guilt that is ruining me. There's also a story behind the reason I feel guilty. As many of his family, friends, specialists tell me it's not my fault I just can't seem to think otherwise. He had alot of mental health problems also, which is why we bonded as much as we did. I just feel empty, like there's a part of me missing, I don't feel as if I am ever going to find someone that i connect with or is as similar as me, and I don't want too. I miss him so much, I'm physically and mentally in pain every day, I even googled 'How to bring someone back to life' with the knowledge it's not possible, I check my messages everyday hoping I get a message from him saying it was all a joke (which I know it's not). I would never put my family through the pain I've been constantly feeling for the past year but I am in so such pain that I think about suicide constantly. I have PTSD plus many more diagnoses from this accident. The flashbacks, the nightmares every night, the deep depression, the memories are crippling me, every second of each day.¬†
¬†Medication/therapy isn't working for me, I don't know how to get over this, Or if I ever will. When does the pain go away?¬†

My sister's husband committed suicide 18 months ago leaving behind 4 kids. Now 17, 14, 11 & 9. It's been a horrendous 18 months trying to support & be there for my sister & their kiddies. The eldest neice has taken it the hardest & only now has she spoken about her dad's suicide by saying that she smokes dope to be closer to him. Her dad was a dope smoker & when he drank alcohol he became very aggressive.¬†She also harbours a LOT of hatred against my brother (her uncle) as he has a drug problem himself & bludges a lot of money from my sister (which she has stopped giving). She treats her mum extremely bad! & thinks she needs to be the parent of her siblings as her mum works a lot. There is SO much more going on. I really need some kind of advice as to where/what we can do for her to help with her aggressiveness & loss. As she is over 16 we can't force her into medical health ward at our local hospital.¬†

Hello,
Now both ¬†my parents are gone I feel so lonely, ¬†lost and struggling to cope.
My Dad passed away in 2010, he was in high care nursing home with ¬†Mum (Mum had been in care since 2007) . It wasn't unexpected but still so hard. Dad was scared to leave Mum, he had cared for her for so many years (Mum also suffered with mental illness from her mid 40's). He asked me, the youngest of us 4 kids and the only girl, to look after Mum. This seemed to make it more peaceful for him. He was 76 when he passed away.
Through looking after Mum for 5 years we had alot of ups and downs. In 2007 she had renal failure, had her last rites read to her, we were told it was her time. She was such a strong willed woman she recovered. At this time she also had suffered 8 strokes which we only found out through a cat scan. She was unable to walk from here on in, although mentally she was wonderful.
We had some extremely funny times as Mum would just say what was on her mind not caring too much for other people's feeling, also very sad times. But I guess this was Mums way of coping.
She passed away 7th November last year. She deteriorated over a few months, she was worn out.
It was so hard to see, I was the only one with her when she passed, daunting but grateful. She also was 76.
I like to think I did exactly what Dad had asked of me right to the end, he would not have wanted her to be alone.
This is my first post, hope it's ok. My name is lee and I'm 41yo.
Thanks for your patience.

Less than 12 months ago I lost my Lab, Buddy. Woke up one morning and he was paralysed from the waist down and the vets couldn't figure out why. Shortly after, my partner and I got a puppy, a beautiful Staffy x Corgi. We named her Sierra. She was our baby, and as any animal-lover knows, fur babies mean just as much as a human baby could. Yesterday, at the young age of 10 months, my partner came outside to find our little Sierra not moving, and unresponsive. He rushed her to the emergency vet only to confirm what we already feared: she had died. They suspected a snake, which was confirmed when my brother raced home to bring our other dog inside and found the dead snake in our backyard. Sierra had managed to kill it, but at the cost of her own life. She was my little baby. After losing Buddy, I thought I would never be the same, but Sierra brought a light into our lives when we needed it most, and now she's gone. I'm so angry. At myself, at the universe, at everything. And so, so, so wrecked. I miss my baby girl so much. Between losing Buddy and now her, I don't know what to do. I can't breathe. I can't stop crying. I feel like I'm dying. I also have an older Lab, Bella, who probably does not have much time left with us. When she passes..... I don't even know. I'm so lost. So confused. Why? Why did this have to happen? If I had just been home earlier, I could have brought them back inside like I always do and she would still be with us. I would have woken up this morning to a hyperactive puppy jumping on my head, instead of hyperventilating and wiping the tears from my eyes. I wouldn't have ended the day at the vet, saying goodbye to my baby girl, instead I would've stayed up way too late binge-watching on Netflix. There are so many ""what if""s. So many ""should have""s. So many regrets. I don't know how to get through this. I don't know if I can.

Well this is tough, last month i lost my companion of 4yrs ¬†Parrot, who got me through so many dark times. I've never fallen to bits so much, i thought i was going to die from distress. I'm still not right, its a tiny bit better, but now it's turned into who's next?, what other bad things will happen?, i feel so down daily, some nights i cry myself to sleep. I was with him in the end, watched his poor little body give up, i think he had a lung infection, noticed his voice was a bit funny night before. ¬†I woke up to him sitting down panting, the trauma i somehow relive it daily, mentally i see it all the time his last breath?, how do i get that out of my head?. It's unfair the bond i had with him was so strong, like he knew me, I knew him. The positive thing that came from all this, his companion had babies and now i 3 nice baby parrots that look like him, but they are not him!!!, I'm trying to bond but it's difficult.. I have the fear of things being taken away from me in life, and this kind of re-affirms it, the pain is so unbearable emotionally. Anyhow perhaps time is the healer idk, i just know it's flung me into this awful depression of sorts..I'm prob rambling on thanks...TC :D.

I lost my best friend and though it's been 6 years i can't let go of the anger and guilt I feel, as though I should of done something to stop this tragic event. Recently I met someone its not the best relationship but I have noticed I have become a cold person I don't allow intimacy to occur as i have now locked my feeling away and find it hard to express my love for my partner. We have recently moved in together. I feel that i'm at breaking point i have organized everything from the bond to the lease, utilities, purchasing the white goods. I have episodes of anxiety and feel so overwhelmed and don't enjoy these happy moments in life i feel as though i'm headed for a nervous breakdown my partner knows nothing of how i feel i should add i am also gay cheers¬†beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to¬†suicide or self-harm.

My parents are both gone. I'm an adult with my own family but having lost both my parents while almost all my friends and cousins still have both parents and even Grandparents. I'm really struggling to get over the feeling of being completely and utterly left on my own. I do have a brother but we've never got along and I am finding it's one sided communication as I don't want to lose touch with him but it's as if I no longer exist at all. I feel as if I have no family and am trying to turn my attention to my husband and babies but it's unbelievably difficult to deal with all of this.
¬†
The other thing is I feel so guilty as I'm in Australia and my Dad passed away back home in the UK. I didn't make it back in time and he passed away before I'd even got on the flight home. When we moved to Australia a year ago I promised we'd be back to visit him hopefully in 2 years for a holiday. Of course, I can't believe this has happened and I never did get to see him again.¬†

Also, my Father's passing has opened up the old feelings of when Mum died suddenly. Now I miss her more than ever and it feels unbearable that they're both gone. My Mum was my best friend before she died and we'd only really bonded like friends over the few years before she died as I'd only just moved out of their house into my own place.
¬†
Sorry, I'm rambling a lot. It just all came out when I started typing.
¬†
I hope you understand as I've literally no one to talk to about this now. Everyone thinks I should be trying to move on and concentrate on my own little family. My husband is a bit fed up of me to be honest. I feel like a dark cloud in their lives just now.
¬†
Thanks for reading. I hope someone understands.

I recently lost my Dad on New Years day after a 10 year illness. Each day it seems to get harder not easier. I feel like I have lost a piece of myself and I have no idea how to deal with his loss.
I'm not used to feeling such overwhelming intense sadness. I don't sleep, I can't concentrate on anything and I physically feel unwell. ¬†
He was such an amazing man, an amazing Dad and Pop to my 2 young boys.
I don't know how to process what I'm feeling.

hi everyone I am new here .three and a half years ago I lost my husband and cant seem to move on. I have tried and even at times seemed to be on the right track. Then a problem would come up ,the house or extra bills and I panic and miss him so much. He was my rock for thirty years and looked after me when my epilepsy turned me into a vegetable. Bought me back to life again. made the decisions and sheltered me from all the worries. now I am alone and lonely and feel I have nowhere to turn. my local GP is run off his feet and doesn't even look at you ,let alone invite confidences. the nearest other clinic is 50kms. I cant make friends and my family are all living away. some days when I have no reason to leave the house I just stay in bed and read. I even joined the local mental health group ,we don't even talk.so that was a waste of time. Ended up at the pokies just to get out of the house and they became a big problem.so it was a call to lifeline and self barring .only way to stop that. Trouble is I am even more isolated now. am I just feeling selfpity? or am I heading for something much worse?

Hello,¬†
first off I hope everyone is doing as best as they can as I'm sure we are all here searching for ways to cope and to even understand other people's thoughts and processes. I have recently lost my older brother, he tragically took his own life without much explanation or warning. I do not know how or where to begin but would love to know if there is support groups or places in Adelaide where people who have been through traumatic events can come together as I struggle to relate to my friends as they don't quite get how I feel. As I don't truly understand how I feel... There is numbness, anger, sadness, love, all in one.¬†

When I was 10 I lost my father to Aids. I didn't understand the reasons or the permanency of death. Now as a 30 year old I constantly ask myself how can I not exist? Why am I here? Why did my dad die? How can I not be me? It makes no sense and it scares me to the point of tears. I have a 6 and 5 year old and I know that not only will I die but they will to. Does anyone else ever have these thoughts? Or is there something wrong with me?

Hi,
I lost my dad this August he was 54yrs old & his death was unexpected. He had been sick for about 2 years but his disease was always making him sick & then he would get better again. My sister & I left in May this year to travel Europe for 4 months & then live in London we both quit our jobs & where just wanting to find ourselves. 
Dad seemed like he was doing better so off we went & 3 months in we had to urgently return home, we got 5 days with him although he was never conscious we got to be by his side when he passed.
There is just so much regret & guilt now. I'm just lost I have to find a new job & be in a home without him. At the moment me, my sister & mum don't really talk about what we are feeling, it scares me to know how bad they hurt I hate it.¬†
I feel like I have no direction anymore our whole world is different & I just feel anxious. I have an interview tomorrow & im so stressed about it, it feels like once I have job reality is going to hit. My sister & I couldn't wait to get out of our sydney. Now we are back here & trying to face life without my dad. He was an amazing man & he held our family together. He didn't deserve to be taken away so early.¬†
I just don't know how to go about everyday life & be happy.¬†
Any advice would be great.

I think I might be grieving for my mum, problem is she hasn't passed away.
she has cancer and so its inevitable that I will have to say goodbye, but I think part of my anxiety and depression is that I'm already grieving for her?
I don't want to be like this, I want to go and see her ( she is in the uk) and I want to make the most of the time I have, but I feel almost crippled with these feelings. I want to be strong but I can't find a way to do it.
i skyped with her yesterday and I was looking at her realising how I'll she was and how much she has changed and I cried and she cried.¬†
I miss her so much already I feel like I'm going to completely lose myself.
i don't know if anyone will have any insights or helpful words, but I just wanted to get this out of my head and I will talk to my psychologist about it when I see him next.

Five years ago my dad died and it took me a long time to come to terms with it. We had a sometimes turbulent relationship during my childhood but we had finally gotten to best place we'd ever been and I was considering moving interstate to care for him but unfortunately that of course never happened. I cried so hard every day for a month that I gave myself intense headaches and even threw up sometimes. Normal? I thought so at the time as did my then-counsellor. After all, death is traumatic. After a couple of months I was able to live day to day without breaking down, though he still has crossed my mind literally every day since, mostly happy memories. So after getting a grip of my feelings of guilt and regret, this past month everything has come undone. I am suddenly having dreams about him every week which I haven't experienced since the year he passed. The other morning I was dreaming of him and as I woke, before I even opened my eyes, I began to cry. I lay in bed bawling and howling for what felt like an hour. I have dreams of him expressing disappointment in me or I'll dream that I see him in public but he ignores me. I wasn't always the best daughter and I am now having reoccurring feelings of intense guilt and self loathing. How can I go from being at peace with it to suddenly dreaming of him constantly and hating myself all over again? I don't know why I'm writing this here but I'm hoping somebody else who has experienced the loss of a parent might have some insight. Waking up and feeling like he died just yesterday isn't great considering I have finally been getting a handle on my depression and anxiety. This has all come out of the blue and it's overwhelming me to the point where all my old thoughts of self harm have resurfaced. Am I being dramatic? I opened up to a friend about it last week and told her about the past month and was met with ""you should be over it by now"" which I understand but suddenly I'm not over it anymore. How is that even possible? When I was on the bus yesterday I was just looking out the window and thought I saw him. For a split second I was 100% convinced it was him but then reality hit me and I felt like an idiot. Five years and that happened....it that abnormal? I don't even want to sleep tonight in case I dream of him again.

Hi there, I'm not sure if this is where I should start but Grief and Loss has led me to the position I'm in now.
I have recently lost the person I thought was my soul mate and life love, not only that but because they know they are in the wrong they have become somewhat psychotic. I'm dealing with a myriad of lies and harassment being thrown at me and I'm on such an emotional rollercoaster I don't know what to do with myself.
I guess my main questions at the moment are, Is it possible to *develop* split/multiple personalities, Is it possible to develop them by choice, and what are the psychological effects?
Sometimes I want to shut everything out so much, feel I'm under so much stress, pressure and pain, that I am able to shut everything off and become someone else for short periods of time, its basically still me but minus any background or history, if that makes sense...? I'm just existing.
I have created an alias for myself, well 2, but they are online presences only and don't have any 'life' so to say. But there are times when I feel like I want to switch to BEING that person for periods of time.
I have a very broad personality, like I'm not the same around everyone (I know that's pretty normal for most), but there are parts of me I feel like I would like to section out, like becoming 2 or 3 different people dependant on situation. For example when I'm around others I want to be the happy laughing fun me, when I'm alone I want to become the serious devoted author, and at work I want to be the standard unfeeling corporate drone to get through each day.
¬†So...
Is it possible, and really is it healthy...?

Hi anyone in new here so please bare with me.
in April this year I lost my only child at 24 weeks gestation due to a rare condition.¬†
Im really struggling I've gone through good and bad moments but by far this is the worst.¬†
from the moment I the dr told me my son would not make it I have felt empty and cold. I have no affection or love for anyone anymore.and I dream about my son constantly.
i dnt understand how my life went from so perfect to so bad in a matter of a few hours, my life really took a bad turn the day I walked out of the hospital with empty arms and know I was walking away from my son and my heart, leaving him at the hospital and there was nothing I could do. I will never forget driving out of the city heading home that night I was discharge driving away from the city lights into the country darkness saying goodbye to my lil boy.¬†
I have no purpose in life anymore I failed my son and I knew that the moment I delivered him and held him he was so perfect and looked so pieceful as though he knew I was his mummy.¬†
But really rips my guts of is that he passed away while I was actually delivering him.¬†
I felt him moving just before the dr told me it was time to push.
¬†im really in a bad place and have a lot of pressure.¬†
My husband has 2 children to his ex who he doesn't see because of me and our late son. (His ex hates me and the fact that we had a child) so he doesn't see them.

thanks for listening¬†

In June of 2014 I moved to Australia to be with my fiance--leaving my family and friends in east coast of the states. I left knowing that my mother's ongoing battle with addiction wasn't improving. My biggest fear when leaving was that something would happen to my mom while I was away. That fear came true on Easter morning when I woke up to a phone call from my father and brothers telling me that my mother had passed away. Since that day my heart has been broken and is nowhere near healed.
I went back to the states with my partner for the services and came back 3 weeks later to continue my life in Australia. A month and a half later my partner and I had split and I decided to stay in Australia on my own. The past 5 months have been a constant struggle. Feeling every emotion possible--all at a heightened level. Whenever I feel like I've taken 2 steps forward I find myself going backwards again.¬†
¬†I realised in this time period that grief isn't just about death--it's about loss. I lost two things, my mom and my relationship. I lost the two most important people in my life and I feel that no one around me gets it at all.
On the surface I seem OK for the most part, people can't see the pain that I'm going through but the pain is so significant and it's not getting easier. I find that I can't talk to anyone to TRULY tell them about my pain. It's not that I don't want to, it's that I can't find the words. I can't even figure it out myself.

I lost my husband 7 weeks ago, although he was ill his death was very sudden, we had been together for 32 years. ¬†My hubby was 52 when he passed away. ¬†He was my best friend and the love of my life, I am feeling very lost without him. ¬†I know people say give it time but for me the pain is more now than when he first passed. ¬†The hardest things I have found are not having someone to share your life with, ¬†to hold hands and cuddle. ¬†The little things that I guess we all take for granted, going out instead of two their is now only one. ¬†How do people get over their grief? ¬† We have two beautiful children who are older and who have also been traumatised by the passing of my hubby so I try to be strong in front of them but I am finding this harder and harder to do. ¬† Does anyone have any advice, I guess I am hoping that others will be able to share their stories and that maybe this will help ¬†me to understand grief.

My partner and I got engaged last year and in that moment life felt perfect. After a terrible argument early this year , we split up. I was very angry and though my heart craved for him, I refused to speak to him. He tried really hard - emailing regularly to me - to win me back. Then one fine day cops came around to tell me that he was found dead at his home. We don't know if it was drugs or a heart attack. He was found after 12 days
¬†Its been six months and I am still grappling with it. Breaks my heart every time I think my babe was dead for 12 days.¬†
¬†the year held so much promise for us and the last 7 months have been in a nightmare.
I miss him so much that it overwhelms me.¬†

At the start of October I lost my uncle. He and I were very close until this year and while I mourned his death I think I was coping ok. I know this was partly because I had so much to do following his death but also because my best friend was there to support me even though he was on the other side of the world.¬†
2 days after I buried my uncle, my best friend disappeared. This was someone I spoke to online or via phone calls multiple times a day, after a week of worry his son called me to let me know he had passed away from a heart attack (just 48) the day he disappeared from my life.
with the news of his death I have literally fallen apart and hiss loss hurts so much more then that of my uncles. I feel guilty that this has hurt me more and I find myself even after 3 weeks not being able to cope.¬†
I loved my friend and now find that without ever realising it he infiltrated a lot of my life. Certain times of the day are hard now, for example- we always talked at 8:30pm every night before he went to work. And I find myself reaching for my phone at these times without thinking or expecting the phone to ring. I get angry at myself doing this and often just curl up and cry.
im trying so hard to distract myself during these times and I am failing miserably
my partner is worried, he thinks I was unable to get closure by not going to the funeral and worried that since my bestfriend was my go to person for most things that I don't have the support I need to get through this. (He feels he isn't enough).
I know eventually I'm going to be ok. But now im not only trying to remind myself not to expect the phone to ring etc and break the habits I've spent 15 years doing with my bestfriend but I'm trying to force myself back together to ease the burden this is placing on my partner.¬†
I suppose I'm looking for advice not just with coping mechanisms but of ways I can better deal (work through?) this loss without my usual support, instead of burdening just 1 person with everything

My husband passed away on 16th September, I found him, in our lounge room, collapsed on the floor. I thought that he had fallen and hit his head, but when I moved his arm there was no response, I think I knew he was dead, but called 000 and did cpr and mouth-to-mouth until help arrived. It was awful. Probably the worst thing I have ever experienced. I thank God for my kids (all adults) who were with me as soon as they could. I am grateful for the friends who have rallied around me. It hasnt been long, I realise that, but I am so lonely. I cry so much and when I think I can't cry any more the tears come again. I wander around the house lost. I don't know where to turn. I am seeing my psych more at the moment that ever before. I take my meds, more aware of how much I need them now. But I find coping on a day to day basis so hard. And the anger, it is so intense. I let people see only a part of me, they dont see the loneliness, the hurt and pain, the depression that is worse than ever. I try not to let people in to my empty world, I pretend all is ok and I am getting on with life, when in reality I am not. My step daughters (both adults) want to come and go through their fathers stuff, I have said no, they dont understand that I need to do it in my own time, when I am ready. They tell me I am selfish, but I need time with what I have left of him, and that is just his material possessions. I dont know what is right or wrong with regards his things. We had been together 15 years. It wasnt a lifetime in some peoples lives, but it was our life time. I am scared of being alone and I am scared of how this is affecting my depression and bi=polar. Its funny people always tell me I am a strong person, but I am not. I am not coping and don't know where to turn. The loss is so immense, part of me wishes I was with with him, not that I am suicidal, just lonely and lost. My children tell me to call anytime, but I don't want to burden them. I wonder where I am heading now, what do I do with my days, how do I continue on. He was my world, we did everything together and I am just broken. Have you experienced what I am going through? How did you cope? How did you get through? Life seems so unfair, we had just moved to a new house, we had made plans. So lost, so lonely, so angry, so heart broken, so depressed, so very very sad

Between june and august i went to 5 funerals. My uncle (very sick) and one of my friends fathers whilst i was growing up. Then my partners grandfather died. Two weeks after that my best friend called me at work and said he and his father had found his mother (suicide). Her funeral was on a friday. Then the Sunday of that weekend my Nan passed away. I was at her bedside and it was peaceful. But when it was all happening i sort of felt like i was making a recovery from one death and boom. Another would come along. So i just got on with it and tried to cope the best i could and supporting my mum. Im also building a house which is stressful in itself. My partner is a police officer and whilst trying to be helpful its been a bit rough. Now im finding that everything has calmed down and is back on track, all the deaths are catching up to me at once. And i find it really hard to get up. Im crying and lashing out at my partner but he doesnt understand. Work (law firm) is also stressful and everything is just piling up and i feel like i cant breathe.¬†

Two weeks ago, my uncle died.
Growing up, I had very little family outside my immediate one. I had my parents, my brother and sister, my grandmother and her husband and my uncle. That was it.
I would like to recognise that I know I am incredibly fortunate just to have had that much. I know many don't.¬†
I have not known grief or loss. Growing up on a farm, losing pets was never that much of a sad occasion. You were grateful for the memory but the loss wasn't usually unexpected. The only other two people I know who have died were great-grandmothers - and their deaths were not unexpected. We celebrated their long lives and all they had accomplished. There was some mourning, but I never knew them well enough to feel that great loss.¬†
My uncle was 48. He was my dad's best friend for almost four decades. He was diagnosed with brain tumours two years ago. He leaves behind two tween children.¬†
Even writing this, I tear up. This was the only person who I have in my memories outside of my immediate family who has been there. He let me live with him for a few months when I moved to the city for work before I found a place to live. When I did move out he was the person I knew I could call at any time if I was in trouble and he'd be there. He is in many of my memories as a child and teenager.¬†
I don't even know how to handle such a loss. The family didn't have a funeral, and while I went home to be with my mum and spend time being supported by my boyfriend (long distance), coming back to my regular life has been incredibly difficult. I live across the other side of the country to all I know and love. I find myself mindlessly watching TV or sleeping or pacing. If I'm not forgetting to eat, I'm eating a lot. I'm recognising signs of when I suffered depression almost two years ago.¬†
Does it get easier? Do you feel normal again? Even those I know who have lived through loss haven't been able to help me - no one I know has any kind of similar story.
I'm at a bit of a loss.

It's been 8 months since my wife has left me and took the kids and moved away.
It still doesnt make sense that she has done this as I treated her really well. Yes we had our ups and downs like every marraige, but to say I ruined her and then proceed to have an affair was horrible.
The problem is I would forgive her and take her back to right the wrongs.
Ive being doing OK and starting to see other people. I just cant proceed any further than friends with these women as when I compare them to my wife, I find I still love her.
Ive been freaking out lately knowing Ive probably lost her for good and wont see my children day to day.

Hello, I'm not used to doing this whole thread thing but I need advice. I lost my best friend (18) to suicide in mid August this year. In the following 24 hours, I lost my brother (15) to respiratory failure. It happened two months ago and I'm still waking up to forgetting they're gone. Every time I remember it tears me apart like it did initially. My heart aches and I can't stop crying. This happens on a daily basis. My brother was like my secons best friend. I can't even begin to think how I'm going to remember that the two of them are no longer here... I never thought I'd ever had to think about it before.¬†
‚ÄãI see my psychologist once a month and I'm no longer in school so I can't see the counsellor. I try to drown myself in work and music and cleaning but whenever I stop something, I just breakdown. I don't enjoy the things I once loved. I bought myself a baby rabbit and he's helping me by keeping me company and keeping me busy. But I have exams coming up and I just can't push myself into studying like I need to.
¬†Part of me feels selfish whenever I smile or laugh. I feel like I shouldn't be happy. I'm just really lost. ¬†But yeah, any suggestions?

I lost my sister - my best friend - about 2 and a half years ago. About three months ago my boyfriend left me, in many ways related to my inability to move past my grief but for other reasons as well. ¬†I have been prone to depression on and off throughout my life, but when I have been at my lowest over the past few years, he was my rock, my saviour, the one who understood and knew what to say and do.
I am trying to get on with things, I am trying to focus on myself and the things that bring me joy but I find that there are so few of these things these days.
The worst for me right now is the loneliness. Without my sister and through my grief, my relationships have all changed, with my friends, with her friends. Some of them can't handle who I am now, the new less fun, more sad version of me. Some of them have moved on and made families in the period that I was focused on my sister's health, then my relationship and now my own wellbeing. Some are just harder to be around; our values and views are different. ¬†The things that I used to enjoy doing are more difficult to do now and I have less people to do them with.
I feel like what I need is to find people who can relate to me, where I don't feel pressure to be happy and fun all the time. People who understand what it's like and accept me for who I am now. Are there groups like this? Two years ago I didn't think I would benefit from this kind of support, but now I think I would. ¬†I just need more supportive friends around me and I don't know where to look. I don't know how it got to this point for me, how I have gone from having so many friends to being so alone. ¬†I guess what I need from my friends has changed and what I am able to offer seems less than it was. ¬†Does anyone else know where to look?

Hi,¬†
Myself and my best friend have lost a friend to suicide almost two months ago. She was very close to him and is not coping well. I am trying to be supportive, let her know I loved her and I would always be there for her etc. I tried organising a catch up even if just for a quick hello/coffee but she can't seem to lock anything in with me or not making time for me (even though she has caught up with a few other friends). I keep trying to tell myself its normal to go through these emotions and you can push people away in these times of grief. But we were super close and now I can't understand why my best friend has pushed me away so much but seems to be reaching out to other friends and her new relationship. She says she isn't happy and nothing is making her happy yet she seems to be very happy with her new partner and is talking to her other friends and not a single interaction with me.
I am very hurt and we have talked a bit about it and I have expressed very honestly but kindly how I feel (mainly that I am hurting to and I just want us to be there for each other, I miss her a lot), but she seems to avoid the issue of how I am feeling very hurt when I just want to be there for her, but also I need her to be there for me as I am grieving too. She has lashed out at me as well, but also says she is the closest to me and she loves me, but her actions tell me otherwise and I really felt like our friendship is broken. It is giving me anxiety and because we were so close, now I feel alone and like I cant talk to anyone. It seems everything she says is the opposite of how she is reacting and that makes me upset because I feel like she actually doesn't care anymore about what we have lost in our friendship too.¬†
I need some insight as to why she keeps saying I miss you and need you, but she won't make the time to catch up, we aren't talking but she has been interacting a lot more with other friends.¬†
I don't know what to do. I have tried everything and I can't handle just being a sideline friend when I feel like I've lost my best friend :( Advice from anyone going through the same?
Thanks.¬†

Hi my name is Ingrid I lost my daughter to suicide 3 years ago and it is not getting easier, I have grief attacks fairly frequently which throws me into a mix of emotions and depression. I also have very little support and as for friends who I can talk to a few and far between which I think makes it harder. Iam no longer the same person and wonder will this ever get any easier, because I don't think I can live my life like this much longer. Thanks for listening..

My son lost the will to live almost 3 months ago.He had suffered with mental illness since about the age of 16 years .He was diagnosed with multipal conditions on numerous different medications .Bipolar,scitzaphrinia,DID,mania,ocd just to name a few.i think this last year of his life was the hardest by far.i saw him at least every second day assisted him with daily activities,doctors appts. Just being there for him.He used to talk about suicide and how he wanted his mental pain to stop and this was the only way out .I tried so hard to get help for him .He even admitted himself to 2 private hospitals for 3months.2 days before he was discharged he tried to end his life in hospital.I pleaded with doctors and psycitrist not to that I was concerned .they told me they couldn't help him anymore.He health went down hill after that.i feel the mental health system failed him and feel I have failed my son.my pain is enormous and I miss him soo much.We need more education on mental health .I think it should be introduced in high school.There needs to be more awareness and more help emotionally physical they need empathy ,love,respect and understanding.I keep asking myself where did I go wrong what should've I done differently.I thought even he said he wants out of this mental torture I didn't think he'd go through with it.What can we do as a community to stop all this wasted lives.I thought my son will see me get old .Thanks in advance¬†¬†beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

Hello
I am new to this board.
I suffered a terrible loss 2 years ago.
My partner of 17 years died.
It would seem I have not been able to cope with the loss and accompanying other losses associated with her death.
There is so much to our story it would seem at time impossible and even like a betrayal to even talk about it all.
However i seem to have become chronically depressed over it all.
The depression started some 5 months after her death.
I did not understand how serious the depression was until I look back at what happened to me.
When she died I lost my best friend and partner.
As a result of bad decisions ,seemingly motivated by grief on my part I also lost my business ,my friends ,all my associates ,my community ,allot of money ,my country of residence for 13 years .
I am an Australian national however we lived in North America .
I came back to Australia for business and maybe relocation but accidentally let my visa expire.
I thought it would be easy to get it back ,however it has proved an impossible task.
I became stranded in a rural town in Australia.
I was semi Ok for round 5 months after her passing.
I would guess it was because I had my friends and business as a distraction and support.
When I lost everything ,including my partner I sunk into a profound depression.
These days I seem to wake up and wish I did not.
I have lost my social confidence also.
I have no thoughts of suicide just a sinking feeling in my tummy.
I cry allot over it all and have lost interest in most things I use to enjoy.
I have had grief counseling.
It was good but still at the end of the day I lost her and everything else.
It is very sad and nothing can change that.
On top of this I am being screened for cancer but have to wait as i have noprivate health insurance.
It all has become too much.
I think it would be for anyone.
The losses where tremendous.
Apologies regarding the length of this post.

My beautiful mum passed away 5 months ago and every day is getting harder. My mum was sick with Cancer but a horrible stroke came out of no where and took her from us leaving us all in shock. In my mind I mentally prepared myself for my mum passing away gradually from Cancer and I thought we still had plenty of time left. The stroke left her on life support and she passed away within 24 hours. I held her hand as she drifted away.
I am generally a strong person but this has knocked me for six. I am pining for her - I miss her terribly. My chest feels tight whenever I think about not been ever able to see her again. I keep thinking she is going to walk through the door at any minute. 
My mum was a huge part of my life and my families life - she was my best friend and I just cant comprehend all of this. She was beautiful, always well dressed and I just thought she would beat cancer and be with us for years to come.
I feel shocked and I feel such a huge loss - its quite overwhelming.......

I find myself on here after all this time because, if there is something that the social media ought to be able to do, it ought to be able to connect people who otherwise would be isolated from each other. And I have been isolated from anyone by a big and horrible word - suicide. More than fifty years ago my father committed suicide and I have never spoken about it with anyone even though I have come to the conclusion that I have to share this experience in order to deal with my feelings properly. Sound crazy? After 50 years! The problem has for me been the big wall of shame and secrecy behind which I have cowered all my life and I think now it has to stop - even if it is only in the ""virtual"" world that I am coming clean. I have had to speak about this stuff with my wife and three kids of course. And once I admitted to a colleague who was depressed, and whose own brother had committed suicide, that this is what my father had done. But that is it. In fifty years, that is it. For the rest of the time I have felt cripplingly and secretly ashamed of father while loving him at the same ¬†time. What happened caused a fair bit of damage as I am sure you can appreciate but, because of the nature of the trauma, I feel like I have not been entitled to deal with it openly ¬†/ socially. It is like my relative died and was buried in unsanctified ground outside the churchyard. If anyone ever caught me standing with flowers in my hand at his graveside I would be giving the game away. Everyone would know my shame. I got the loss but It feels like I also lost the right to grieve. I wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience?

I was 9 years old when I and my 7 year old brother were alone in the house when we found my father had died in his sleep. In a cruel twist of faith almost 39 years to the day we found our 13 year old boy had also left us while gently sleeping. In my mid 20's my brother and his friend were walking along a sea promenade in the middle of the afternoon and were both taken by a freak wave. They were never found.
I guess that sort of qualifies me to speak about coping with grief. As a little boy I became aware early that I needed to make a decision. I could get all the sympathy and support I needed, but I never liked it. For some reason playing that card did not make me feel good. I didn't understand why at the time. The grief would occupy all of my mind and I found the same thoughts going around and around in my head. They weren't taking me anywhere. No parent should ever have to bury their children but it does happen. Yes of course I get a bite of pain when I see his friends now driving around in cars and wonder what life would be like if he was here. But this next paragraph, I believe, is the key to coping with grief.
On one hand we have sadness, a sense of loss, confusion or maybe even anger. On the other we have pride, treasured memories and admiration. We have a choice which one we can put into our mind. The mind is like a computer. It will take and run whichever program we give it. I wake up on their birthdays and am immediately faced with a choice. THERE IS NO UPSIDE WITH SADNESS. So I swap a sense of loss with a sense of admiration.
Of course I miss them and any psychologist would probably have a field day with me, but when I carry that sense of admiration around with me, and as those beautiful memories come forth, I develop a little inward smile that just radiates my day and lights up everything.

I moved to Australia from the UK just over three years ago for a two year secondment through work. Three months into my adventure here, my Dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer. The day that they called to tell me, the first thing Dad told me was that he didn't want me to stop having my adventures, that I was to continue living my life as normal and that was what he wanted. So I did. I've settled here and I love my life. This year I've fallen in love for the first time in my life and I should be happier than I have ever been... And some days I am. But my Dad's doctors have run out of options and he is deteriorating fast and I can't handle it. 
I'm going back for a visit soon, taking my boyfriend with me (it is so very important to me that he meets my family and now especially my Dad)... But I can't help but think that I'm going back to say my goodbyes to a man who I love dearly, that will not be around to walk me down the aisle, to see his grandchildren, to see my life here and realise why it makes me want to stay. And I don't know how to say goodbye.
¬†I feel selfish staying here and yet to go back to the UK would mean I'd just be going there to wait for him to pass, which neither him nor me really wants, I'm sure of it. And yet I feel like I've abandoned my family when they need me the most.¬†
¬†I'm just sat at my desk at work crying right now, it's one of my bad days. I get good spells and bad spells and yesterday I got a message from Mum telling me that she thinks I'll be shocked at how much he has deteriorated and it's triggered another down spell... But I feel like I need to be strong for my parents because I'm not even there to see the reality of the situation, dealing with it day to day.
If I can't cope with this, how am I going to cope when the inevitable time comes and he's no longer here?

Hi everyone
I lost my beautiful husband 7 weeks ago in a tragic accident at home.¬† I had not been able to contact him during the morning so came home early from work to find the car he had been working on had crushed him when the jack stands collapsed.
My life has been turned upside down and a good nights sleep is a thing of the past.¬† I am trying to deal with a couple of major issues - finding my gorgeous husband crushed under a car, losing my soulmate (we only met when I was 42 - I am now 55)), a financially motivated step son and people dropping out of my life left, right and centre.
I am struggling to keep my head above water and have sought the assistance of a psychologist.¬† My husband and I never fought as we discussed everything and always came to an agreement about everything.¬† We had a rule that we never went to bed angry and we also parted each day with an ""I love you"".
We spoilt each other rotten and did absolutely everything together so life now is extremely difficult. We were best friends and we crammed so much in our 12 years together that we felt like we had been married for 50 years.¬† In fact, we lived life to the full.
There are probably many more people on here that have sad or tragic stories, so any help you can offer me would be very much appreciated.
Thank you
Donna

I've been handling my mental health problems somewhat better lately. But 2 weeks ago a very good friend took his life whilst struggling with a very bad depression. For 9 or 10 days I cried alot or put it out my head, but at the end of last week that all changed. Whilst there is grief I also have a great deal of fear;¬† that my mind can't cope with it all and I'll become ill and maybe very ill.To let you understand. J, another friend and I were very close friends because of our illness. I'd known J for over 15 years. Because we'd all been in a terrible place we understood each other and I would say that we knew each others illness better than anyone else. For 9 months was very ill and though he has family I was his only other confidant as for whatever reason he didn't want the other friend to know. We weren't constantly in touch but each call was charged with J's illness. Anyway, 2 weeks ago his wife rang to say he had taken his life. He'd never attempted suicide before. I think if he had I could have accepted it more easily but J was the greatest fighter I knew. Thank God I don't feel guilt. As I said I feel frightened. I went to see my gp yesterday. He asked me if I wanted to harm myself - I don't but the question really freaked me out as he never asks me that. I wanted him to say you'll be fine. He said he thinks I'll probably pick up but is seeing me in a month. I am so scared. Suicide frightens me so much and I have a very good idea where J was in his head. People tell me that I'm¬† much better than I realise (I've been recovering for 13 years now). I have no confidence in my mind and I'm scared. The funeral is tomorrow and naturally it will be good to get it by.

Two weeks ago, one of my best friends died. An aneurysm. Sudden. Shocking. She was only 32. I'm moody. Teary. Irritable. So incredibly sad.
I also live with my mother. She has terminal cancer. I try to juggle work (although, now four days a week) and caring for her. This is hard enough. I love her so much. Mum is the nicest, warmest most giving person... ¬†
The loss of my friend has really exposed a nerve. Just so vulnerable and raw. I'm trying to grieve, but without overly affecting my mum. This morning I had ¬†meltdown over boiled eggs. Maybe it's too soon to expect normal 'reasoning'...¬†
I'm trying to live a simple life. Remove myself from stressful situations. I don't want the stresses of my corporate job. It's too much. 
I try to relax doing creative things. I create crochet hats for mum. Booties for my friend's kids. Scarves.¬†
I just feel so overwhelmed with sadness. I hate when people tell me to be strong for my mum. I mean 'wow, really, I'd never thought of that'. ¬†If only it was as simple as putting a smile on my face and everything would be ok. But it just doesn't work that way.
I don't believe in prayer. I don't understand how prayer will fix mum's cancer cells. My father died from cancer 14 years ago. I'm an adult... but I'm an only child. There is no other family to help me.
I think I need reassurance that my emotional state is not 'out of the ordinary' given my circumstances.¬†
Just struggling at the moment.

this is my first time here. i don't know where to turn as losing my son in January this year has killed my soul. i feel as if i have exhausted all the support i have had around me and i can see how everyone has gotten on with their lives and rightly so, but that's not where my life is at. this is the loneliest feeling i've ever experienced.¬† it's so hard to listen to people talk about the struggles in their lives as i would give anything to swap my struggle with theirs, i find it difficult to not think of their ""complaints or issues"" as quite trivial, in fact but i do recall that given one year ago, i too was one of these people thinking i had problems.¬† how a day can change your life, actually not even a day, just those crucial few minutes that you wish you could take back and change.¬† i wish i had a mundane life again with trivial complaints.¬† i feel the only place to turn now is here, where i can be anonymous, where maybe there is someone else feeling what i am feeling to help ease my feelings of loneliness.¬† i don't like it when people say i'm looking good, that doesn't feel like a compliment at all, it feels as if losing my son doesn't matter at all and i have just moved on with life and superficial appearances....even though i know full well that's not at all what they meant.¬† i just cant be happy about anything any more.¬† i also despise it when people say i need to look after myself now and get on with my life.....how offended i am when people tell me that !¬† let them walk in my shoes and see if they feel like just moving on with life as if they just lost a job or something bearable like that.¬† there's no joy, no passion, no excitement, i'm just an empty shell without my baby boy and can't see the light.¬†

Hi all, this is the first time I have posted one here..
My partner is 24 and last year his twin brother tragically died in a motorbike accident. He is very good at covering up his feelings. He refuses to cry or show his pain around me. Although he does open up and cry around his mates it doesn't happen often.
I have tried multiple times to get him to seek some counselling as I can see it is affecting him. He drinks a lot and is very angry when drunk (he has never hurt me but always seems to pick fights). Last night while at the pub, he opened up to a girl who he went to primary school with and told her he plans to kill himself on his birthday which is in September.
Hes away this weekend on a 'boys weekend' so I haven't had the chance to talk to him about it, and he has no idea that I even know. I have spoken to his Aunty and Uncle who are helping me support him and we are trying to workout where to go from here. He refuses any sort of counselling and says he is fine.
We have a 13 month old son and it really hurts me that he thinks its fine to leave myself and our son in this world alone.. I suffer from mild depression myself..
Im also worried he may have bipolar as his mother does and his attitude is much like hers..

Thanks for reading. Sorry it's so long, any advice greatly appreciated..

I lost my best friend in 2008 in a tragic helicopter accident that I was suppose to have been on but didn't as my one year old at the time was unwell. This was devastating to me and for many years I struggled with her passing. Too young and too many things in life yet to complete and achieve. I cant help but think that I was not there in that moment for a reason.
I lost my grandmother who grew me up from a infant. I was holding her hand when she passed. She is always in my memory and my heart and thoughts.
Its been 7 years since l lost my best friend and 2 years since I lost my grandmother who both played a very important role in my life.¬†
I struggle at times but its made me realize that life is too short and all I want is to be simply be happy and love life with the people I have in it.¬†
The journey has been hard and long but I've finally overcome the loss. I miss them and shed tears when I think of them but I know they would want me to be happy and to make the most of my life.

Hi I lostmy daughter Ashleigh, August 7th 2009.. And I still struggle with overwhelming grief without her.. Flashbacks of that day..
she was born with a congenital heart condition, had 4 open heart ops.. And lots of hospital stays in her 16yrs.. She was a little fighter... And 09 her health went down hill with pulmonary hypertension, and she was looking aga heart lung transplant.. It was such a shock! She decided to do all tests for transplant.. And it was then we realised her pacemaker was getting close to being replaced.. And they weren't wrong.. A week later we were back and waiting for adr and anethasist to do her surgery.. Took 2 wks before they did it, and she got so much sicker waiting...I walked up with her to the theatre.. She was so looking forward to feeling better.. As she lay there, I mouthed to her, I LOVE YOU.. She nodded at me with a smile on herf face.. It was only 20 mins later we got called back, because they were trying to revive her.. Complications with surgery and the hypertension... They managed to revive her.. And she went up to icu..¬†
They had stabilised her and our dr said they were going to let her sleep over wkend.. But when we went in the nurses were till weaning her off, and slowly waking her!! The icu dr had not relayed anything of what ourdr had said.l.. And then when they did her obs, she got startled and things were beeping everywhere!! I was telling her I was there with her... And then they sent me out..6pm we lost our beautiful Ash... We miss her so much,and some days I really struggle... I haves great husband, a a great faith, but some days it's not enough!!! I wishi could of taken her place..I dontbelieve she's in heaven watching over me, and I hate it when people say that.. Because really, if Ash saw how much we were suffering, and how much she was missing, she would be devastated.... ¬†How do any of you out there cope.. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi!
My parents are in their late 50's. They are in good health and there is no reason I believe they will be passing sooner rather than later.¬†
However, I worry about how I will deal with their eventual death. I have a history of depression and anxiety, and my folks have been a huge support. I'm concerned that losing them would be a huge blow and I would struggle to cope with their loss.¬†
Does anyone have any tips for how to prepare for the death of loved one's? More so, in the long term. If you have lost a loved one, was there anything in particular you struggled with, or wish you'd come to be aware of sooner?
¬†Cheers!

I am 32, with a wife and 18 month old son which I love very much. Just over 2 years to the day I lost my father unexpectingly. Loneliness, grief, sadness, longing are all emotions I feel every day. 2 years has passed and things don't seem to get any easier. I know nothing will change and I can't bring it back but I need to move forward to help, support and love my family.
I finally found the courage and saw a counsellor. The first few visits have been productive and helpful and I will continue for a few more visits. I hope my lack of communication, distancing myself and troubles have not caused a divide in my relationship with my wife that can't be fixed. Although seeing a counsellor has been productive I wish I could share my feelings and thoughts with my family as they are my life.
I have written this to share my thoughts rather than keep them to myself and am not specifically after any feedback.

Hello everyone :)
Hopefully I won't bore you, I'll make it brief...
My Dad passed suddenly a few years ago and I don't think I've been the same since. ¬†I miss him terribly, and even though the raw feelings of grief have eased, I have this constant nagging fear that I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop - so to speak. ¬†Who's next? ¬†What's next? ¬†Since my Dad passed I have been the primary carer for my Mum, whom I love dearly. ¬†I am so worried about her, all the time. ¬†Has she taken her medication? ¬†Has she had a fall? ¬†My husband is wonderful, he's my rock. We don't have kids (we are unable to) and I worry about him, all the time. ¬†Is he ok? ¬†Has he been in accident? ¬†I love my pets so ¬†much. ¬†Unfortunately, they are elderly now too and I worry about them, all the time. ¬†Will they be alive when I get home? ¬†My job involves caring for the elderly with disabilities. ¬†That in itself is stressful. ¬†
The time before my Dad passed now seems like a distant, foggy memory. ¬†Even though I've always had social anxiety, I'm pretty sure I used to be happy quite a bit and maybe even carefree at times. ¬†Now, I dread getting out of bed. ¬†I don't have any close friends, and I hardly ever hear from my 2 sisters. ¬†Rarely a day passes when I'm not on the verge of tears. ¬†I don't have any motivation. ¬†I feel like I'm not living, just existing, waiting for the next inevitable tragedy. ¬†
I hope someone reading this can understand, as I've almost given up hope that my life will ever be any different.
Thank you for taking the time to read my story :)¬†

She was recently diagnosed with a mid-range heart murmur soI now worry about her all of the time, I don't want to lose her, I just want her to live forever and be with me in my life. ¬†My dog is so much to me and I can't imagine what my life would be like without her in it. ¬†I adopted her two years ago and my depression has been much better with her in my life, she makes me happy and I love her so much, she is just like this burst of joy that I was lucky enough to have come into my life, I still can't believe I was so lucky that noone else wanted her and I was able to have her, I feel like she was meant to be with me and I was meant to be with her. ¬†Even when she is just sitting beside me having a snooze, like now, I feel 100% better, I don't know what to do if she dies or how to cope with losing her. ¬†I don't know if I should bury her or have her cremated, I worry about ¬†what bad things may happen to her soul if she is buried or cremated. Not sure if anyone can help.

... But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; Thou livest; report me and my cause aright To the unsatisfied.
Never believe it:
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:Here's yet some liquor left. ¬†¬†

As thou'rt a man,
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
Absent thee from felicity awhile,
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
To tell my story. 
Hamlet
For those who follow these post, you might know that my dear son Nick hastened into this god night. Well, it is now almost 6 months ago, but only last night.¬†
But I feel cursed. Suicide seems a family trait.My father. my son, others. These past few months have been as bad as you can imagine. Oh, I have a few supportive friends, a partner who tolerates and cares for me in equal measure and doctors who are wise in when to express sympathy and when to challenge. Most others are useless. My bosses way of support was to advise that they didn't feel I'm ""a good fit"" at this time. I little cared. We maddies are use to platitudes.¬†
¬†Anyway, I'm posting this by way of reassuring BB online monitors, who I feared interpreted a previous post that I may be suicidal. To praraphrase one of my favourite TV shows Sling and Arrows, when the lead character Geoffory Tennant is ask by a Police Officer after a pub brawl if he is a suicide risk, he quibs ""isn't everybody"" But for myself,I'm more like Haratio than Hamlet. I wish I wasn't. And there are never gurrantees. My doctor finds it acceptable that I've no wish to add to his gallery of the dead but it is a professional hazard. ¬†He sort to reassure me that my father and son would have been in a dissociatiated state when they died. I'm not completely convinced. I certainly reserve it for myself to die I chose clear headed. But we have a safety plan; I report in, take my medication, follow advice and stay away from dangerous locations.
I find solance is Ophelia's lament. ""And
will he not come again?
And
will he not come again?
No,
no, he is dead:
Go
to thy death-bed:
He
never will come again.
His
beard was as white as snow,
All
flaxen was his poll:
He
is gone, he is gone,
And
we cast away moan:
God
ha' mercy on his soul!
And
of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.""¬†
Anyway, allow me m pain. It tells me Nick was alive and I loved him. Its my journey and I would wish anyone else to join me.

Hi there,1 month ago, I lost my grandfather to cancer. It was sad, but it was his time and the family has accepted this loss and is moving forward, last week I lost my cousin who was 33 and fit as a fiddle, He leaves behind his 2 year old baby girl and a pregnant wife with their unborn child. The day after I found out about my cousin, who I spent countless days and nights playing with when younger, my girlfriend broke up with me. She said she didnt want to be in a relationship, and that was that. It happened so quickly and there has been no closure. Whats even worse, she did it over the phone and ultimately, via a text message. I have borken off all contact, but she hasnt attempted to msg me in over a week now. So its not looking good.¬†

My depression started 22yrs ago with the death of my first son but it wasn't diagnosed until the following year when I had twins and the doctor thought it was post natal depression. I have been taking anti depressants ever since and can't go off them as I plummet down to the depths of despair if I try. I have a chemical imbalance in my brain so need the pills to fix it.
10 yrs ago my beloved husband was taken by cancer and I died that day too. I was left with 10 yrs old twins to raise so I put my life on hold making sure they were ok. In 2010 I decided to start dating again and had 2 disasters.
the first was still married and the second turned out to be a serial conman who took me for $20000. I will never trust any man again.
my son has been a very troubled boy since his dad died. He smoked weed but got off it but substituted it with alcohol. He's now lost his driving licence on 1 yr probation and has to do 40 hrs community service. He still hasn't learnt a lesson thought and goes out boozing all the time. He'll end up in jail one day.
i am so very lonely and sad all the time. I force myself to go out but don't enjoy anything. I sit alone at night crying and long to be with my husband again. I would've thought I would be past this by now but it doesn't pass. I guess I just learnt to live with it. It doesn't SMTP me being lonely though. I don't have anyone to talk to as my family and friends live 16000 miles away on the other side of the world.
i know I need help to feel better. Nobody knows about this. It's my secret. Everyone thinks I'm a strong woman but alone I'm a wreck. Can you pls help?

I must have walked under a ladder with a black cat on Friday the 13th. ¬†Since 2007 my life has been one setback after another. ¬†My sister-in-law passed away from cancer early that year at the young age of 51. ¬†Later that year, my husband and I separated after 35 years together. ¬†We had grown apart and no longer made each other happy. ¬†I retained the marital home in our financial settlement. ¬†Our separation was very amicable and we remained good friends. ¬†I continued to work four days a week until in 2008 a change in administration had me answerable to the supervisor from hell. ¬†She made my life miserable in a job I had held happily and successfully for 17 years. ¬†I tried to battle through this but it was soul-destroying. ¬†In 2009 my son went on an extended overseas holiday and he is now a resident of Canada. ¬†I miss him terribly. ¬†In 2010 my husband announced that he had a new 'companion'. ¬†This news was hard for me to hear, but I knew one of us would eventually move on. ¬†He went overseas with her and on his return, told me that he was having some health issues. ¬†He was diagnosed with bowel cancer and passed away in early 2012. ¬†He left his estate to our children. ¬†I was not a beneficiary. ¬†Later that year, my working life had become intolerable. ¬†I walked out and ended up in a doctor's office shaking with anxiety. ¬†I was granted sick leave which then extended into leave without pay until I was forced to relinquish my position at the end of 2014. ¬†Since then I have been doing a little casual work and with my savings dwindling, have resorted to Centrelink for help. ¬†At the age of 61 - 5 1/2 years too young for the aged pension, I am now on New Start allowance and am looking for work. ¬†The problem is, I am so depressed about my situation that I don't even want to get out of bed! ¬†I do not want to burden my family with my problems. ¬†I am embarrassed and ashamed that my life has come to this. ¬†To top it all off, I have now discovered that I have termites in my house which is my only asset. ¬†I know there are people out there who are worse off than me but I can't see any light at the end of the tunnel and I just wish the Earth would swallow me up. ¬†I adore my two children and don't want to cause them any pain....they are the only bright light in my life. ¬†Please help me!!! ¬†How can I rise above this?????beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

My son took
his own life not long after the New Year.¬†
He was 22 years of age. As a child he was diagnosed as having ADHD and
later this was clarified as Asperger's syndrome.¬† He was to experience learning difficulties,
his parents‚Äô divorce, his mother dying much too soon, having to take what work
might be offered and various tribulations of life.
As you can
imagine I miss his more than be imagined. I have other children whom I need to
be available for. My friends and partner, and my own medical professionals have
sought to help me. I take each day as it comes, but with each day the
realisation that my son is gone.
This is not what I want to talk about. But the context. What keeps
distressing me is every time I see some article in the newspaper or professional
journal asserting that suicide among young people is getting worse. Only this
week, I felt anger when I heard a welfare professional on the radio claim that young people were more likely to kill themselves
than die in a car crash. I wanted to
yell at them that there has
been a fantastic improvement in reducing suicides, but even more dramatically
reduction in road fatalities.
¬†
My partner thinks this anger is just my sense of grief.
My doctor nods wisely advising that we know folk twist things to get media
attention. I‚Äôm still left with my anger. I have told my doctor that I was responsible
for keeping my son safe. My doctor at least offers I would feel like that,
instead of most folk lamely say I did the best I could. Even if I did, he is
still dead.
¬†
My son sought
medical advice on his own initiative about the increased anxiety he was experiencing.
He took the prescription medication he was prescribed.¬† I had accompanied him to see a clinical psychologist
and did not miss any appointments. I‚Äôd helped to arrive had also enrolled in a TAFE
course. Spent increasing time with him, listened, reassured, tried to get him
to come out places. He‚Äôd sometimes come to my partners for dinner, to the
cinema, cooked together, but other times said he was tired and just wanted to stay
home. It still wasn‚Äôt enough.
¬†
But it
is people who know better lying about statistics that angers me. I can‚Äôt change
this. I hate those who tried to big note themselves by making a horrible
situation worse. I really hate them! I miss my son. I want him back.

I lost my father three months ago, he was diagnosed with bone, lung and liver cancer in December 2014. It was so unexpected to hear he was so unwell and it was so serious. I was away on holidays when he was diagnosed and given only two months left on this earth. He made my family promise not to say anything to me until I got home. This was the first news I heard when I came home, my dad was in hospital from the unbearable pain. I didn't know how to cope with the news and tried to pretend it wasn't happening. We brought dad home from hospital and got to spend my brother's birthday, Christmas, New Years and Australia Day as a family. These were the moments we all cherished and held onto so tightly. The two months we got were so full of life, dad always stayed positive and tried to make everyone laugh on a daily basis. Dad became more and more ill and eventually had to be admitted to hospital for pain management. On the day he passed we were expecting to bring him back home and he was so excited to be coming home. This was such a big shock for everyone as he was so bright the day before. I spent almost the entire day by his bedside and didn't want to leave him. It's been three long painful months and I still miss him everyday and expect him to walk through the door with a big smile on his face. It's been so difficult trying to deal with the grief and be able to talk about how I feel. I'm also at university in my third year of studies and my focus this semester is completely gone. I feel upset everyday and don't know what to do? I love and miss my dad so much! I'm only 21, he is going to miss out in so many life events :(¬†

Hello,
In 2012, I lost my Mum a week before school started to liver failure. I did not know what to do, I felt so overwhelmed and I did not want to go to school, however my Dad thought the support there would be good so I went. A month later, my good friend was in a terrible car accident and passed away. I couldn't go to school anymore. The thought of him not being in the classroom shattered me. I got really sick with anxiety and depression and didn't go to school much. Later that year my Grandpa passed away of a heart attack.¬†
I started to get better, things were starting to get on track. However at the end of last year, my step grandpa who had been my swimming coach for nine years passed away.
I am lost. I do not know what to do. I hate these feelings I have and I cannot let go of them. I miss them so much. Why does death take away the most beautiful people? They didn't need to die yet, they had so much more time to live. I don't understand. I hate getting close to people now, I am afraid they too will disappear on me.¬†
I miss them so much.¬†

I lost my last remaining close family member almost a year ago. She was my rock, who loved me for everything that I was and everything that I wasn't, truly unconditional love. This has obviously been a massive jolt to my system, especially as I am the kind of person who people would not necessarily believe would suffer from a lack of self-esteem; I am outgoing, play lots of sports and have a job which requires me to be 'forthright'. However, lack of self-esteem I do sometimes have, and like all of those types of things, this is worse when I am under stress, tired, etc. To lose her lost me my final back-stop, the one person who had known me all my life and loved me without reserve.
I have friends, one of whom is amazing at putting things into perspective but she lives in the UK, has a family and with time-zone differences, I don't like to bother her too much. I have a couple of good friends here but they have busy lives also and I don't want to 'use-up' all their time.
I started my first same-sex relationship a few days before Wendy died (my first relationship in 15 years) and it has not been smooth sailing. She is a great person but we are very different and i can't tell if some of the problems between us are caused by my grief, by the differences between us or other factors.
I am afraid that I am staying in a relationship I am not suited to in order to have someone there, to compensate for my loss and am willing to put up with a damaging relationship to not be completely alone.
In the same vein but opposite side, I am afraid to let it go as we still seem to have something¬† special but are having what are normal relationship difficulties but i can't deal with them because I a) haven't ever really been in a 'proper' relationship and b) I'm a bit all over the place with grief.
I can't deny that we are very different, she is very scientific in her thinking and American and I am more spiritual, a feeling person and english by birth. But I am very scared of losing something special that just needs a bit of work and suffered from the trauma of my loss but at the same time I am also worried that my grief is being made worse by my possibly staying in a relationship that isn't good for me and is making my emotional instability worse; I really am in a quandry and trying to work it all out.
Thanks for this forum, it has helped just to 'say it out loud' so to speak.

I've always known I was one of twins. My wee brother John died 24 hours old. My Dad was the only one to see him. We were born 12 weeks prem. There is no grave or marker for John. My Dad said he went up in smoke like comes out of a chimney. I've now found out theres no record for him either. No stillborn record looked. No birth certificate record looked. No death certificate record looked. My wee twin John who is part of me , been part of me all my life, who has lived with me. Never recorded? Is there no official paperwork for wee John. Are we the family the only ones who know. So that when we all die no one will know he was. I have no one to ask my parents are now dead . Him and I against the world and against and for each other. Funny but he and I have had a love and hate relationship all along. He's me and I'm him.

Ok, so I was wrong.
I was posting to another member the other day (it could well have been Alan) and saying that my Mum sadly left this world on 14th October 2014 and that next week (ie:¬† today) will be 6 months to the exact day.¬† I said that I would be no sadder on that day than I've been already.
But I was wrong.
I'm down, well I have been for a fair while now, but I'm down and it feels like the black dog has got hob-nailed boots on all four paws and he's booting me.
It'll pass I guess, but at the moment, things ain't good.

I can't even see that it's that bad, yeah I'm sad and just going say to day, but I can't even see the hurt I'm causing around me, or the spark that has gone from within myself.
i get upset, I get angry, it's unfair, I feel like lying in bed all day, I want to be alone... All of these things I think and feel.

What happened today?It was my brother's birthday today. He would have been 21. I still feel so incomplete about his passing. ¬†I remember the night quite well.

Too damn hard. If I set my mind loose about my brother, it is always brought back to the night that he died. I was 12. He was 6. I remember seeing this tiny child in my mother's arms, tubes and wires going everywhere.I didn't believe that he was going to die.He always pulled through everything.My brother, the fighter.I remember becoming concerned when I saw a Doctor talking to mum, the Doctor broke down in tears and I just knew this was the end. I ran to my brother and pleaded and pleaded with him not to go.Pleaded that I would be a better sister and that I would protect him more.I pleaded so hard, I even said prayers to God, even though it had been a very long time since I had come close to saying a prayer. I prayed and prayed and prayed. I watched them pull around the curtains. I frantically pleaded with my brother not to go, not to leave me. ¬†I remember looking up at the monitors and looking at his heart rate.I remember the number 186 His little heart was beating 186 beats a minute.Then I saw the numbers ¬†fall.We were losing him.I remember the nurse turning off all the monitors and alarms and left the bedside.I remember hysterically pleading with him to not go, that we had a lifetime of things to do together.I was beyond hysterical.What was I going to do with out him?. I remember seeing a lifeless little body, my brother was dead. This is why I don't do anything on my brother's birthday. ¬†Every time I think of him, this is what I remember. I can't get it out of my head. ¬†It's like it's burnt forever in my memory, those thoughts and memories aren't going anywhere. ¬† It's too HARD to celebrate when this is what I think of when this time of year comes around.

We found my mum passed away on Christmas Day 2014, cause still unknown. On top of it, my brother and I are looking after everything as mum was divorced a year before this after 35 years of marriage. I wish I got time to say a proper good bye, the shock has been intense. This is on top of various family issues.
¬†I want to try and make sure that everyone makes the most of time with their loved ones. This grief is unbelievable especially with the sudden and unexpected circumstances. There's a big hole in my life and I know it'll get better. I'm very fortunate to have beautiful friends and colleagues. I don't know how I'd have survived without these people.
One strange thing is, the very little information on grieving when this happens (direct contact) I'm still waiting nearly 3 months later for counselling via the coroners court, although I ended up sourcing out my own.
I now cry every time I see a news article on accidents, or sudden deaths, feeling for the family that weren't able to tell the deceased how they feel. I feel for those family members and friends so much.

Have started writing this a number of times now, and am not
sure where to start so I guess I‚Äôll jump right in...
My parents passed away within 5 weeks of each other last
year. ¬†Mum passed first, which came as quite
a shock, as although she had emphysema we had been told time and time again by
the specialists that she was not anywhere near end stage yet.¬† Dad had dementia, so we made the tough
decision not to tell him mum had passed as he was at long last settled in a
care home, and hadn‚Äôt known mum the last time she had visited.¬† We felt he had had a tough enough time and it
would only cause him unnecessary distress.¬†
But it would seem that after 50 plus years of marriage there are ties that
dementia cannot destroy as on the day of my mums funeral, my dad turned to one
of his carers and said ‚Äúyou know my wife is gone‚Äù.¬† From that moment, he moved quickly through
the end stages of dementia, stopped eating and drinking, and slowly slipped
away from us over the following weeks.¬†
The best thing we could do for him was to make sure he was not in any
pain and let him know it was ok to go, after years of mental torment it was
time for him to find peace.¬† I thought I
was ready for losing dad, I had mourned our relationship years ago, when he no
longer recognised me ‚Äì although I still felt there was always an emotional
connection when I saw him.¬† I know now
you are never fully prepared.
I have good days and bad, and had actually felt I was doing
really well as this year started, but the last couple of days have been tough, I
have found myself exhausted and the tears have started flowing again...¬† It would have been their 53rd
wedding anniversary in the middle of Feb, and around this time last year was
the last time I spent any quality time with my mum ‚Äì I‚Äôm an ex-pat so all my
family are overseas.¬† I have a great
doctor and have been for counselling and I know everything I‚Äôm experiencing is
a normal part of the grieving process.¬† I
also know how lucky I am to have had both my parents with me for so long.¬† I just needed an outlet today so hope it‚Äôs ok
to share on here, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who is experiencing this sort
of situation so maybe it will help others to know they‚Äôre not alone.

I just don't know what to do. I've been married for 2 years, together for 10, and now my husband says he's no longer in love with me. We have a 2 year old child and hubby is sleeping in another bed the past couple weeks. Yesterday he told me he's been happier since doing this. We've both seen a counsellor individually a couple times and hubby admits he's depressed. I'm pretty sure it's mostly based on relationship issues we've had for 3 years or so (I think I got depressed after my Dad died and then I possibly got postnatal depression too and somehow put up walls against intimacy, so barely any sex. He then felt rejected and now no longer loves me. We've been together since we were 18). It's just that I love him so very much and haven't shown it and now I'm scared it's too late. He's leaning towards separation and has even taken his wedding ring off. There was also a brief infidelity moment on his part, I guess because he felt so emotionally rejected himself. He says he isn't sure what he wants which is why he's still living with us, but the counsellor makes him question things but he's no longer sexually attracted to me either. He has mentioned not making any big decisions until he is sure but I feel so hopeless sometimes. I feel so rejected. We also work together. He has brought up such issues of splitting our belongingings and who should get what and seems to think too much water has passed under the bridge but is being plenty nice to me. I don't know how to deal with my pain. I really want us to try and work through this and love each other again (a long road I know), but he just seems genuinely like he's lost those feelings. Do I just give up? I feel like he's going to move out soon. I've tried to back off but have told him I'm there and I won't give up. But I'm gutted and just don't know what to do. I feel like giving up. He really is the love of my life.¬†

I always think I am crazy, grieving for my Grandparents when they are still alive. Last night I cried myself to sleep because I do not want to lose my Grandma. Because of situations, my maternal Grandparents practically raised myself and my brothers. Their home was a safe haven; a happy place. Whether we were inside in the kitchen with Grandma or outside in the paddocks with Grandpa...those are my favourite memories. I haven't been particularly close to my own Mum because events made her very reserved and in her own little world. So when I needed someone to talk to (especially a female) I would go to my Grandma.I would talk to her about my struggles, my broken heart, dreams that I had. Grandma never passed judgment, only kindness and love. However, she was strong enough to correct me if she thought I needed it. She taught me everything that a young lady needs to know in life. The last couple years her memory has been getting rather bad. At first it was just little things, but now she can hardly put sentences together. It's like she knows what she wants to say, just doesn't know how to say them anymore. Apparently she is having lots of little strokes at the front of her brain which affects her thinking ability. It breaks my heart to see this beautiful woman slipping away. I have tried not to question and not to get angry at God but I can't help it. I honestly don't know how I am going to cope without her. She is my Grandma, my sister by heart, my angel and my best friend. I almost wish I didn't love so much because then it wouldn't hurt so. When I was little and they would go on holidays; I would go into total shut down mode. I would not eat or sleep, so in the end they would take me with them. All I know is that when they (my Grandparents) got to their eternal home; I want to go with them.

Recently our family has undergone several deaths , my husbands grandfather, my stepfather and a close friend. I have over 20 years having had depression, and it has been diagnosed. I am finding lately i am continually worried about when my own time will be. I know that no one has the answer to when or how, and i understand it is nature, but i am so focussed on the fact that one day i wont be here and this is causing me so much grief and anxiety. I havea wonderful husband, and a three year old son, and the thought of not seeing them makes me have anxiety attacks. I am having morbid thoughts about it, and it is impacting my ability to enjoy life fully im focussed almost obsessing over it. I don't know if this is a phobia, my psychologist is on maternity leave so i am looking for a new one, and i don't want them to think im weird, finding someone i trust is really important to me. My own parents are aging, and the thought that one day i too will age, and die is so painful for me. What can I do? Are there any suggestions out there for how to help me deal with this continual worry? How can i get over these feelings?

i have a huge heaviness in my heart these days. im 21 years old and have just found out my father has a very agressive cancer and has been told by doctors that they cannot cure him of cancer only help maintain ¬†quality of life for as long as possible. i dont even know how to handle the emotions surrounding this issue. i live 4 hours away from him with my partner, whom ive been with for 4 years and starting to build a life with. my first instinct was wanting to go home to my family, but my dad does not want this and my partner cannot come with me if i chose to go. but my heart is tearing my in so many direction.
on a different note my partner is so unhappy. i have no idea what is going on im trying to be there and be understanding,and try to support his life plans for us, but i have so much sadness in my heart right now i dont know how to hold things together for the both of us its all becoming so hard and stressfull. and there seems so be no happiness in our lives right now and i really dont want everything to come crumbeling down :( please can anyone relate !

my dog was hit by a car today. I feel like it was my fault because she jumped out the car window just after I had parked. She's never done that before. She died instantly. I was at my daughter's place. I made her go out to the road. I couldn't look. It was so terrible. We are all grieving her loss. I lost another dog a few years ago. I actually ran over him. I lost the plot and ended up in hospital. I just hope that this won't send me over again. All I can think is what if! Why did I put the window down? It's terrible. She was my husband's little girl. I'm just feeling so terrible. My heart is aching for everyone and a dear sweet little dog who shouldn't have died like that.

My partner and I recently lost our bubba at 15 weeks pregnant. ¬†The grief of this has torn us apart after nearly three years together. We are in our late teens/early twenties, which complicates it further being young. I have both diagnosed anxiety and depression prior to this event. I strongly suspect my partner has both too but I can't support him in a way that can convince him to get any help and I am very concerned as he has spoken openly of sucide.¬†
I have reached breaking point with this and other stresses in my life.
I guess im just hoping someone who has been through something similar might have some advice to offer.
Thanks either way

Hi There,On Saturday I had the police turn up at my work to inform¬†me that¬†my Nan had died.¬†¬†This all comes at a time where my psychologist had started lengthening the time between our appointments because she thought I was doing so well and was well on my way to recovery since ahuge depression/anxiety bout last year. My doctor also impressed with my improvement said she would look at reducing my antidepressants with the view of weaning off them all together later on in the year if I kept doing well. I also decided to leave the comfort of my salary job to go to TAFE to study this year which was a huge step for me.¬†Now, I feel like I'm not doing well with the grief. I can't cry but yet my emotions are on the boiling point. I'm sleeping but it feels like I haven't slept at all. I'm even falling asleep at my desk or even on the floor of the bathroom at work today. I'm constantly exhausted and everything is an effort. Its a huge effort to get out of bed in the morning and my partner forces me to get up. I don't want to slip back to where I was. I saw my psychologist yesterday to help but we could only cover so much. I see her again next week. She said that these things are normal signs of grief and just to go back to basics to get through this hard time.¬†Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with grief, how not to slip back into the dark cloud of anxiety and depression (especially since mine was based on separation and bad things happening to those I love). I just can't get the horrible picture of my Nan dying scared and alone out of my head and its even haunting my dreams :(¬†

This year is 3 years since my mother passed of cancer. It was so bad and I'm so pissed off. they like found something ages before but said it was nothing and then 2012 she had a fall at home and was having seizures and I was in shock and crying and then she went to hospital and then they found lumps on her brain and then it just spread every were and in the blood and then she went down hill. I was lucky anuff that there was a trial drug and that gave her months till she passed Jan 2013 in that time I saw her go from what she was to what she ended up like she was. She ended up having lots of seizures but there was nothing any one could do. I didn't even like spending time with my own mother as I would worry that she would have a seizure and that felt bad. I was an still am grateful my grandma and her partner could take her in and look after her. My mum ended up having one more seizure and ended up in hospital and couldn't talk or swallow and got annoyed cause she couldn't go to the toilet by her self. In the end she was not given any pain meds and then went peacefully. I'm glad she got to meet my now husband and new he would look after me. Im glad he was and is my rock. I now have anxiety and depression and agoraphobia. it was really bad. I used to be able to not be left alone and now i can stay at home by my self. I'm having trouble going out to places by myself as I think something bad will happen. I've just been able to go round the block and down into the servo. I cant go anywhere else by myself. Its relay hard as my hubby cant get work unless its at night when I'm asleep. I have to have a phone with me so i feel safe. I had a baby and it hurts that my mums not here to see her to hold her to hear her talk to find out her name. she always wanted me to have kids ¬†and now I have one its hard shes not here as she would of been so good with her. I get sad when other ladies who are around mums age hold her and it makes me want to see that with my mum. I find it hard some time to look after my own baby sometimes when i used to be really good with babies. I have a amazing friend whose like the big sister I never had and she has been through things with me and that's helped having a female around. I also have a neighbor who kind of reminds me of my own mum and its nice to go sit with her.¬†
¬†even thought I have these women and am very great full for them I still feel lost hurt and some days just want to cry and do cry. I find it hard to get up in the morning.

Today I lost my dad. He was diagnosed with cancer 3 weeks ago and he died today. We were able to look after him at home for the last week. I'm extremely close to my father. I became sick in my early 20's and my parents looked after me. I left home for a while but then my mum and dad had health issues so I moved back in with them for the last few years.
I'm feeling a complete overwhelming panic. I don't know how I'm going to continue without him. He was the strong one in the family. I still suffer with my health and my mum is quite weak. How do I stop the panic? The thought that I don't know how we are going to cope without him. I feel so numb. I still can't believe he has gone. I feel like I'm pretending he is just away or in hospital. How do I keep the panic at bay? How do I do this? How do I keep going with just my mum and me. I'm so grateful I still have her but they were extemely close. Married 59 years. What if I lose her then I'm completely alone. I don't do alone well. And I don't have anyone that I can get to move in. I'm terrified of being alone and now with dad gone I feel it's just a matter of time. My health really hampers being able to do things and get out of the house. 
¬†What do I do how do I get past this huge thing that has happened. He hasn't even been gone for a day yet and I'm already a wreck.

Hello,
I am new to this, really, I have no ideas what I am even going to say. I am not sure how to deal with my shock and sadness. I am however seeing a doctor and a counselor (for bipolar, depression, anxiety and follow-up DV from 2 years ago). 
I figured on here wont hurt!¬†
2 months ago we found out my father (73) had terminal cancer, 5 weeks later he passed away, 13 days later my husband left me and drained all of our bank accounts. This was my 2nd marriage, we only been married 2.5 years - this is the 4th time he had left me. 
I have been delivered the cruelest double wammy.
I miss my Dad more than I could ever have imagined. He was always there to celebrate my achievements, to deal with my issues, he¬†was my rock when things went wrong in my life. But I feel like I have been robbed my grieving time and energy for my father, as I am hurt and trying to work out what to do now my husband has gone.¬†
Is this something that happens ... ever? 
Do some people just decide it will be too hard to support their spouse as they grieve the loss of their loved ones?¬†

Hi,
Quote from a funeral director on a Billy Connelly show tonight ""Grief is like a doorway...so high you cant climb over it, so wide you cant go around it, so deep you cant go under it....YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT""
And quote from Billy Connolly ""If death was with us everyday....we wouldnt care so much about it"" 
They say on average a person undergoes grief from a death every 10 years. But they didnt include marriage/partner breakups. And girlfriend/boyfriend splits that can have just as devastating effects. 
If we were to 'expect' a death of a loved one and (sort of) accept that we will experience such grief, then maybe we can semi plan for how we are to manage our feelings at that time.¬† This sounds great eh? Planning your grief routine, What rubbish!!! Lets re-read that first quote about the door of grief....you have to go through it!
But if we do accept that we will ""go through it"" - the deaths of close ones and lets say none of these cases are any less devastating than the last, then perhaps we can expect it to happen. Wouldnt that assist in some way? Perhaps, perhaps not. for we know that everyone is different in this terrible experience of grief.
One thing that has helped me and might help you, is to take that loss you are experiencing- to the extreme. For example-
When my brother died in 1979 at 27 from his own hand, my mother at the time said ""I've lost a son, not many people lose a child"". At the time I lived in a unit and 3 doors down from me was a couple that came from Queensland. Eventually they told me their story which included the fact that in one car accident they lost 3 children and the ladies mother and father. Thirteen years later my father died and my mother said ""not many people lose a husband and a son"". I reminded her of that example. It didnt sooth her pain but it became a baby step to recovery. At a time when one feels they have been inflicted with the worst of all blows, it could indeed be worse. And the hands that embrace you at a service for the lost one...those hands are there while some people lose so many members of their family in one swoop or within a short space of time, it is a positive of sorts that it could be worse.
Yes, you have to go through it. Grief is not avoidable for most of us. Even the seemingly toughest person on earth cant avoid it. But it is part of us on earth in this life and we will never rid ourselves of the shock, the despair and the sheer loss.
But in some cases, it could be worse.

To You, My Dad, John. 11-12-64 ~ 5-12-92 ¬† 22 years today it's been since you left.¬† Left the physical world, left your uncertainties, left your own life. The years pass, and I get older and time changes most things, But never the fact that you're not here. Nothing will ever change that and it never gets any easier. In your absence and as the years pass, I've learned so much about reality and life's short comings, But mostly about what happens when finality kicks in. There's no closure, no questions answered and no bringing you back to tell us why!!! And with that I realised quite quickly in my young life that there's nothing myself or anyone else can do about it. So what do we do?? Lose grip on reality and live a life We can blame on tragedy and the downfalls?? No chance. We keep living and fighting with a cause.¬† Im not delusional and I know I can't make miracles happen, but I take losing you, the uncertainties, the sadness and all the unknowns and I channel them and use them as power & ammunition for me to get through my days. I refuse to lose or be beaten, I will never wallow in self pity or blame anyone or anything for my downfalls and losses, I live a life I'm proud of, And try to make the world a better place. I struggle, I fall, I hate life sometimes. It's reality, it's life, But despite the struggle, life is always worth staying and fighting for, your death taught me that. There is so much greatness to live for, the blessing I've been given with my family, friendships and the opportunities created for myself. The light and hope does appear, and there's always people willing to help & support other people. I will spend the rest of my days trying to lift the taboo's and negative opinions that surround Suicide & mental illness and I will advocate for and support causes that help people with their turmoil and tough times...Because I wish with all of my soul that there was just one person to help you when you went through yours. I will never hear your voice, see your smile or feel your hugs of support.¬† But I know with every ounce of my being, you're my guiding light and biggest support and ali. I feel that in the decisions I make and the things I think and feel.¬† May your soul be resting eternally in the solace you so deserve Dad, and I'll be sure to catch you on the other side. Until then, I will love you immensely, and miss you even more.¬† All my love for you always ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è¬†

I have never really written on one of these before but tonight everything has just been so overwhelming. 2014 has been one of the hardest years of my life so far. At the beginning of the year I lost my aunty to cancer. It was really hard to deal with because she was my favourite and closest aunty, my dads only living relative and as all signs were showing she was improving greatly but unfortunately randomly took a turn for the worse. The guilt that I was supposed to fly over and see her in January for her 50th birthday has been eating me alive. That chance to see her one last time before she passed that I didn't take because my dad couldn't get time off work and I didn't want to go alone. She was the first person I've lost and that was really hard to deal with, I don't think I've quite dealt with it to date. It made it harder to deal with the loss because on top of losing my aunty, I also lost friendships with four of my closest friends. I'm not very good at being alone but for most of this year, besides my amazing family and two friends that have stuck by me, I've had to deal with the loneliness. It's hard for me to deal with overwhelming feeling of suffocation from sadness, anger and envy because I don't have a hard or bad life. I just can't comprehend why I feel so terrible all the time when my life isn't even bad..I feel so guilty for feeling this terrible. I have a great family, an easy going life, I have my health, a roof over my head, I lead a good life. Tonight everything has really gotten to me and feeling torn between not wanting to die, but also not wanting to live has pushed me to the point I wanted to reach out, the point where I need to reach out. I guess I just want something other than the 'you'll get over it' that I've received all year, the 'I don't really care' response just makes it hard for me to open up to anyone I thought really cared.beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

My daughter passed away last October while undergoing her second heart surgery. I have a 7 week old baby who was due on my little girls angelversary, I was induced early - for my own mental wellbeing! But I have been struggling a lot lately, I think maybe it's a combination of baby blues and grief. I have started having horrible nightmares, I've woken from my sleep sweating, screaming, crying, and it's really messing with my head. I have been putting on a fake smile and convincing everyone I'm fine, but I'm really not coping, with the nightmares, my own insecurities and having a new baby.. I'm not scared that I'll do something stupid or irrational.. I'm just worried that my cracks will start to show more and my children and my husband will be the ones who suffer!

Okay, so this is a bit of a yucky post..I'm just feeling so confronted by all of this.my father suffers from depression and anxiety, so does my older brother and so do I.there seems to be more and more ""family history"" of it all popping up as we go on..basically as I was the first one to be diagnosed with mental illness, at that time there was no recorded family history of it anywhere.no one really understood my condition (which I am still struggling with on and off 5 years later), my family doesn't seem to take it seriously.since my diagnosis, my brother contemplated taking his own life (he went so far to write a will) but seems to have recovered now, my father came out with some sort of psychosis and we had to have him involuntarily treated in a hospital earlier this year.. He's living with my grandmother now and was on the path to recovery..until last Tuesday anyway..his brother (my uncle) seemed to pretty much ""spontaneously"" commit suicide..I just don't get it..Last Monday he put my dad and his name down to play bowls for Wednesday, then had some kind of argument with his wife on the Monday night. By Tuesday morning he called in sick from work for the day, called his doctor and made an appointment, but suicided before the appointment.What pushes someone to end it all so spontaneously?the family is devastated and I just can't get it off my mind.. I wasn't really close to my uncle, I guess I'm more upset because the family is so upset.funeral is this Thursday and I'm not sure if I can bring myself to go because the family is all pretty close except me.

I'm 21, my mum had been physically sick with a whole range of illnesses my whole life which I believe led to her also being what I assume was heavily depressed and even for lack of a better word, mental.
also, we never really knew everything that was going on with her because neither her or her doctor would tell us and she was always bitter or sleeping which made it very hard to communicate effectively with her.
i cared for her a lot whilst growing up but I never realized I became relatively desensitized to her suffering because I was around it so much.¬†
I said many many hurtful things to her. I know now that I was taking my stress from her out on her, and she had lived for so long being so sick, my family and I naively got used to an idea that she was always going to live.¬†
Even the week she died we knew it was imminent but we didn't know how to react and she refused any help and had half lost her mind by that stage, so we kind have just went about our week relatively normally knowing she was likely to die any day then.. A thought which we had been having for years but was so much more real at that stage.
¬†it has been 1.5 years since her death and I live with heavy guilt every single day and night. I used to be so positive and now it's like there's no point. My siblings don't feel the same as we all have different experiences of relationships with her and I hate bringing it up to them because I don't want them to feel bad. I've always been the strong one who has been there for others and never asked for help.
¬†i feel like I will never heal because you can't change the past and I can't take back the horrible things I said to her.¬†
No amount of positive words or affirmations or self forgiveness has helped at all.
what can I do? I try talking to her spirit, I've been to psychics, I've written to her in my diary etc. but I feel no change.¬†

Thank you

After reading some posts this morning, I realise I am not alone in my depression. Today has been a bad one, I now see many of you out there, like me, are still struggling with loss years later. I lost my mother to suicide; my partner in a car accident; and recently one of my closest friends. 3 women I was very close with. Guilt. Anger. Questions of why me? Weren't you happy enough taking one special person from me? Why three? Some days I cruise along, smiling, working, not sharing what is happening in my head. It's not cool for us guys to show emotion. Suicidal thoughts? Sometimes. Anniversaries are always so hard. Birthdays. Christmas. I randomly came across this site today. After reading many posts with others describing their struggle to deal with the loss of loved ones, I can now see I am not alone. I feel for all of you struggling with the horrible emotional roller coaster we ride every day. Is there a group which meet together to talk these things through? I have tried the GP. I have tried the shrink. Sometimes I just need someone to listen to me talk and cry out.

With over 40 years of being a fairly happy female and never having really had much to do with grief, I have recently been confronted with the death of someone else's child I don't even know and never met through social media (Facebook).¬† It has broken my heart, and I feel like my life is crumbling around me.¬† I was just a light user of Facebook, but over the last couple of months, friends have shared stories of other parents' Community Facebook pages of their own children recently having died of cancer.¬† They continue their Facebook pages as a way of grieving.
Not knowing much about childhood cancer, I read through their stories and the mothers' constant updates throughout their journey, their photos, even the ones closer to their child dying - so confronting for me.¬†I was coping ok with them, although I was feeling different about life as I knew it, and then I read about¬†a beautiful little 6 yr girl who only died only a few weeks ago from soft tissue cancer, and she reminds me so much of my 5 yr old daughter.¬† I am totally devastated by reading about the pain this little girl endured for over 2 years, and every photo she has a smile on her face, and then¬†her final days in extreme pain, and now her mother's painful grief.¬† I can't stop thinking about¬†the little girl and her mother¬†and feel guilty if I try to return to my family's happy and healthy life.¬† I constantly cry, can't eat, don't want to face life¬†and feel like I will never be the same person I was once before.
I keep going back to her Facebook page as her mother updates most days, and the only good thing about it all is that she died in the arms of her mum and with medical supervision.¬† But, why can't I get over this?¬† Why do I need to revisit her Facebook page?¬† Many friends have said stop reading it, but I feel like her mum might post something beautiful up and I will miss it.¬† I have started to see a psychologist to try and find out what went wrong with me, and she thinks I may be suffering from Vicarious Trauma, which is more related to Health Professionals dealing with constant trauma.¬† There isn't much on the internet about social media and the effects it can have on us.¬† Is it this little girl triggered something in me as she reminds me of my daughter, or is it that I can't cope with all these sad stories on Facebook and the internet, news etc.

my little brother died by suicide a few days before christmas in 2012. it was the hardest thing i have ever experienced. not just my own pain but seeing how crushed my mum and dad werejust left me so heartbroken. we were always fighting as kids and teens but we became good mates later in his life. i would stop by his house on my walk home from work and we would have a few cones and watch tv and just talk about what ever was on tv or in the news.they day i knew he died i was at work. my dad had called me that morning quite irate. he couldnt get in contact with my brother and was getting scared. i assumed he was over reacting as parents do.then i saw a news article on facebook about a man who was my brothers age who had died on my brothers street. it was him, not that i was sure at the time but i can admitt in hindsight im pretty sure i was in denial. i read the article, absorbed it and went back to work. i told myself i was stupid to think it was him. my mum called me a bit later and said she was worried about my dad, he had stopped in at her place on the way down to my brothers and she said he was really agitated. i told mum not to worry and that ben was fine, i even told her about the article i read that day and laughed about the coincidence that a man the same age on the same street died. i cant get over how stupid i was, everyone was telling me something was wrong but i just.. i dont even know what the term is.. blocked it out isnt sufficient. it was just.. it wasnt like i felt like i knew it was him and i was blocking myself from thinking it. i just didnt think it. i had all the facts but that last mental domino just didnt clink downwards. so much so i just went to lunch like normal. i bought red rooster.during my drive my phone rang but i couldnt find it so i let the blutooth answer it. it was my other little brother. i told him he would have to speak up cos i was driving and on speaker. ""ben died, mum said can you come home?"". in that moment everything clicked and i just looked at myself thinking... you ...... it was so obvious. and i had really said all that stupid stuff to my mum and dad... joking about a guy my bros age on his street of like 12 houses dying the day before... my mind just cracked a little that day and i dont think its come right since.¬†¬†

I'm having a difficult time dealing with the upcoming anniversary or my sisters passing. Two years ago I lost my sister to her 5 year battle with breast cancer. She passed away on my birthday. The trauma of the event has been extremely difficult as I find it hard to talk to anyone about the way I feel. My mother makes the situation much more difficult as she has picked up post traumatic issues with paranoia. My feeling have been pushed towards the back and I am constantly made to feel as though my pain is not adequate enough in comparison to 'a mother losing a child'. I struggle with an eating disorder and have been for the past 8 years. I feel as though I an spiralling downwards and I cannot sleep at night due to my depression. I need help with how to cope?

It is now almost 7 weeks since my husband was found neardeath on the floor of the Dementia Specific Unit he was in. He died soon after. The DR thinks it was possibly a massive heart attack. But they don't know for sure. He had been in the Unit for about 2 months & prior to that in a low care facility ( at the same place ) for about 20 months.¬†I had written here before as I was very depressed.¬† My daughter was able to come home from Canada for what turned out to be 5 weeks which was really good for both of us. She has found losing her dad so suddenly very hard. She is now back in Canada & I guess I am now finding that the strength I had to have for her is goin' missin'. I am getting so down, tearful & depressed again¬† ( not suicidally yet thank God ) that I am finding it very hard. Now I know that tears are okay. I know that grief is okay. But the fact that my husband was the only person I had ever been out with, trusted & wasn't scared of is coming back to haunt me I guess. Yes, I was assaulted as a kid & a young person & so was very scared of men. Until I met my husband.He had been my rock for 45 years. I miss him so. I guess I just want to hear that it's okay Ellen. And don't be afraid to ask for help.

Hi all, I just signed up today. I was feeling pretty good until a few days ago. I have my anxious days but there's always a reason for it - uni stress usually. But I read an excerpt of anacquaintances ¬†upcoming book at 1am on a freezing night and it's been my undoing.¬†The book is about drug addiction and the piece I read was about a suicide attempt. (Which she was brought back from). 15 years ago a very good friend of mine took her life. She wasn't fortunate enough to be in a public place. She had gone through treatment, rehab and detox during the time I knew her. She decided to move out of the city so we wrote letters and I visited her twice. She was going to meetings and seemed in a good place. But the letters stopped and I couldn't call her. I finally called her mum three months later to find out she had died a week after I last saw her.¬†¬†I didn't get to saygoodbye at the funeral, I just had I get on with things. It was very sad and weird. But I did get over it. Until I read that piece of a book. As it's all back again.¬†¬†This week I've teared up at everything. Had a stupid altercation with my stupid neighbour / landlord so home sucks too. My gf is away, my children are with their dad until tonight. I feel lazy and miserable and kinda pathetic right now.¬†thanks for letting me just write that out.¬†beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I am Grieving for the relationship I had with my Brother after he severed all ties with me due to my apparent betrayal of him
I am Grieving for the Father I never knew and will never know now
I am Grieving for my lost innocence and childhood after being continually abused by my step father
I am Grieving for what could have been and the opportunities lost.
When you grieve for someone who has passed over, it is so very final but doesn't hurt any less. What I am finding so difficult is the grief is overwhelming. It feels like someone has died but without the finality of attending a funeral or celebration of their life.

Hiim new to BB and wanted to share my story. I feel like all your threads have spoken to me in some way or another and so hopefully can add something that someone else may draw from.My history starts from being diagnosed with adolesant depression at 11 and being on meds most of my life. I more recently took them up again after an affair and also losing my brother to suicide a few yrs ago and found i couldnt cope. My drinking and drug use got out of control in an attempt to self medicate and then my other brother died from a heart attack due to long term drug abuse. This only pushed my own abuse into overdrive.¬†¬†More recently i have attended drug and alcohol detox and am on my 22nd day of sobriety. Realising its a long hard road to come back from all the anguish i have inflicted upon myself.¬†I am now trialing my 3rd different anti d in the last month and am scared andtired of the self loathing and being in my own company. I havent recovered from the deaths of my siblings nor the daily self punishment for my past/current actions. I feel like im losing grip.¬†beyondblue's clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

I lost my eldest son in 1997 to suicide, ¬†now I have just lost my eldest daughter to what I feel is the same. ¬†We have to wait for 6 mths for toxicology results as her autopsy was deemed inconclusive. I dont know how to feel or what to do
¬†After my son died, it raised all my grief from a miscarriage I suffered about 5 years earlier, and this in turn made me all clucky and I desperately wanted to have another baby. I was just 40 and although my marriage was rocky, we had not just 1 but 2 then 3 more kids, with an oppsy at 45......... ¬†¬†¬†At the same time my daughter was also grieving for her brother but had met her partner and they too were having a family, so we alternated having babies for the next few years with both of us having our last 1 week apart in 2003. Soon after my marriage ended.
After some years a rift happened with my daughter and I still don't know why, but she moved to qld with her partner and kids.(my grand-kids) ¬†Until last week I hadn't seen her or the kids for about 7 years, it was her choice to cut us out and try as I might she refused to have any contact with us whatsoever. It has been really hard trying to deal with the loss of those years and the loss of her. ¬†With friends relaying her recent posts on FB the state of mind she was in led me to believe her.
I don't know if what I am feeling is self pity or the right amount of grief, I have my kids I have to look after alone, they have no (or very little) contact with their father, so I have to be there for them as well, and life, work, everything I am responsible for is all just too hard right now. ¬†I just don't want to do anything. Its all too hard.

This week is one year that my beautiful mixed up niece, at age 23, took her own life.¬† I reflect back to all those years of no contact with her or her parents and it is very sad. I feel sad of the loss that we didn't get to see her for quite a long time.
She was a lonely girl who just wanted family, wanted her dad - but she never got him; never got to see him.
I will remember my niece as a fun loving little girl who used to play with my children down at the beach, making sandcastles and playing in the water.

My husbands father was diagnosed with advanced melanoma 10 weeks ago he passed away 2 weeks ago. The day of his funeral my father died suddenly from a heart attack.¬†
I now have a grieving husband, mother, mother-in-law, children, brothers and sister and myself.¬†
As the eldest child I have always ¬†been the one everyone can depend upon. While my sister has been wonderful in helping my mum I still feel that this is largely my responsibility.¬†
My mother-in-law appears to be coping quite well whereas my mother is not my husband seems also to be coping ok but the amount he is drinking tells me otherwise.¬†
I miss my dad terribly. I can't enjoy anything as I keep thinking he should be here doing whatever it is we are doing. I want to cry all day everyday but I do t for fear of upsetting everyone so I leave it till bed time or in the shower.¬†
¬†
I just don't know what to do first. I can't be everything to everyone and I can't expect to ""get over"" all of this quickly but I'm just on edge constantly. I can't sleep with everything going through my head and I don't feel I can turn to my husband as he has his own grief to deal with. It's all too much !!!!!!¬†

I watched my grandpa die on September 27 2012 at approximately 11:45am, yet I haven't started grieving. I have completely shut it off. This also means that in turn, I haven't grieved for the loss of my baby on the 7th of April 2014 at approximately 3:30am. My little angel who would have been 1 this year. I haven't grieved for my beautiful little dog Cadbury who was my fur baby that I had to put down or my other fur baby lily who is in a new an loving home. I haven't grieved for my grandmother who passed on the 2nd of December 2014 at 2:30am an I haven't grieved for the loss of my physical health that has ment I'm physically unable to work, an most days even function on any level.The thing is, it's all starting to bubble to the surface an I can't seem to be able to push it down. I haven't cried since the 26th September 2012.¬†I'm not ready to accept any of this as my reality. I'm not ready to let go¬†

Hi there,
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† I have been suffering depression and anxiety for about 5 years now and am new to this forum and the beyond blue experience, tonight I thought I would try something different as I am just struggling to cope at the moment. The usual life stresses of work/life/full time study and a long distance relationship with my boyfriend of almost 3years balance with a mental health condition/s I am also struggling with the loss of my best childhood friend that I suddenly lost almost a year ago. I think about her everyday and miss her more than anything. She was my best friend since we were 7 years old, I am almost 23. We never had any problems in our friendship and it was that one person who knew everything about you and you didnt need to explain when you felt sad or upset because she always knew. At the start she was my main support and as selfish as this sounds I now am unsure who I can fully discuss my pain with as my partner just purely does not fully understand mental health issues even though he is the best support and does listen whenever I need it.
People always say it will get easier with time, but does it really? It's already been almost. year and it feels like I lost her yesterday. So much reminds me of her and I know she would want me to life my life to the fullest and be happy, but I feel as though how can I be happy when she is dead? Has anyone been through a similar situation that can offer some of their thoughts or feelings to share please?
¬†

I lost my wife in 2011 & I tried to be a carer for her too towards the end (she had diabetes & her organs were failing too), I couldn't stay in the house where we were living so now I'm in a Homeswest unit on my own, gradually after she died I didn't get hardly any visitors & I got lonely & no-one to care for.
i tried my best but for few years now I've been on oxygen 24/7 due to emphysema (30 cigs a day for 30 years. Haven't smoked for 7 years) now I find it hard to get out of bed sometimes & personal hygiene is very poor, I don't care about my appearance much now.
i just want to feel a bit of happiness & enjoy life a bit instead of feeling tired & no get up & go,¬†
I used to think alcohol would do it but it didn't.¬†
This is my first time on bb

Hi All
¬†Was wondering if anyone else holds on to significant dates for years and relives the hurt? For example this week three years ago I broke up with my ex so I have had a bad week knowing it was the anniversary of our break up and reliving the pain.
¬†Is this a common symptom of depression? How do I put a stop to this and move on?

Hi, I'm a newbie.
In a nutshell, I work full-time, study part-time at uni (on campus 1 day + online) and a bit over 2 weeks ago my mother-in-law died suddenly at 52.
She had been battling cancer for just over 18 months and was recently told to stop treatment. She was given 6 months to live, 6 weeks ago. She went on the holiday she'd been planning for ages, had emergency surgery whilst away and was finally 'well' enough to travel home. We thought she was recovering¬†and back with us until Christmastime. A dislodged blood clot suddenly took her life whilst in hospital. She never made it home. We buried her a week ago.
Prior to this I was already 'down';trapped and overwhelmed with the pressures of juggling work and school, as well as on-going family issues.
I went to the¬†Drs today to get¬†more time off work and she suggested putting me on a Mental Health Plan.¬†This has helped somewhat in the past (I intermittently suffer from anxiety and they were at an all-time high around my wedding 2 years ago), but I just feel like it'll be the same thing: relaxation, breathing techniques, medication discussion (which I am resistant of).
I was reminded of this site when I googled 'I can't stop crying', as that is the kind of day I've had. I have assignments due tomorrow (which I've already had an extension for), but I simply cannot organise my thoughts right now. I feel numb outside, but my heart is physically hurting inside and I feel alone. I feel guilty, weak, stupid and¬†confused at the intensity of my emotions.
What about my husband? He cannot deal with seeing emotions, especially me crying as I am the 'strong type'. He becomes miffed and walks away. His way of dealing with his mother's death is to seclude himself in the shed, whilst 'getting on with it'. He is also planning a week away to see (our) friends, without me. All of this I know he needs to do- and it's his way of grieving, but I¬†can't help but¬†feel unsupported by him- then I feel guilty for those thoughts, guilty for taking our mother's death so hard- afterall, she wasn't¬†MY mum, yet I feel her loss has magnified the 'down' feelings I was already having.
I feel like I cannot turn to friends as grief makes people uncomfortable and although people say 'I'm there for you', it's really a token.
I guess I will see what the psych says. In the meantime I feel sick about how far behind I am at uni- not just with assignments, but school work also. If I cannot do my best I don't want to do it.

Hi I had a good friend of mine kill himself 17 years ago(I was 17 at the time as well) and his death still hurts me. I haven't really talked to anyone about it before apart from my wife. ¬†I was wondering if I should talk to his parents about him as his death so I can finally put it to rest or is taking to them a bad idea.

Past: I was lucky enough to say goodbye to my aunt over¬†2 days last yrafter she had been diagnosed with C, decided no treatment and was starving herself to ensure an earlier departure. She died 5 weeks later. She was like my mother- my mother, her sister, committed suicide when I was 5.¬†Their father committed suicide 2 yrs later. Her 2 sisters attempted multiple times.Recent: Easter 2014. So my aunt's gone. Acceptable as she was fit 1 day, suffering the next and it was her choice not to have tment. Then my sister was diagnosed with C. Unacceptable. Treatment offered, given. A week after she was diagnosed, my dad died suddenly. Unacceptable - we weren't prepared, he wasn't sick, it was my sister we were focused on.Then, my ex husband, father of my 3 adult kids, was diagnosed with terminal C. What the ?? My kids are falling apart. He was offered a trial drug, to extend perhaps life expectancy to 30mths - 10% chance. 50/50 of 11mths. Our poor kids. How they're hurting!Back to sister. Treatment completed. All was supposed to be good.¬†Except for new C in pelvic bone, liver and kidney!!Back to ex. Experimental¬†tment - 10 weeks¬†pass before they commence because govt approval was not given until the new tax year. Staff at the hospital required professional devt. 10 weeks may not sound like much but a 10cm tumour in the right lung is now 32.5cm. They don't even check nor treat the cancers within the lymph glands.Today:¬†I've done well. So many family members suffering. Everyone it seems.¬†I gave in yesterday. Took me over 24h to get out of bed just to write this. I don't want to give up. I know what it's like for those left behind. I've been there. My mother's suicide has formed the person I've become. But I'm running out of caring and energy to keep going. I feel as if I' ve got nothing left to give nor the desire to take.My daughter rang 2x within past 24 hours, telling me how she had a panic attack, how she had to leave work early because she just can' t cope. Geez, telling her mum this who has had two days off work as the mere thought of it is totally exhausting. That's why I made the apt with dr 2moro. What do I need? Who knows...pills, counselling, whatever...what do I want? An island where I can hide.The worst is that it's only going to get worse, before the healing can start. That could be months or years or who knows. I don't know whether I can last that long! Or can be bothered to actually.That's my story. 8 points.¬†beyondblue‚Äôs clinically-trained moderators often work offline (invisible to you) on issues relating to suicide or self-harm.

So sad about the genius Williams. Am new to this forum. I suffered severe depression last year, got better and stopped my meds in september 2013. Was great until a few weeks ago and noticed early relapse - poor sleep and appetite. Didn't want to go back on meds cos of side effects. I spoke to the only friend who knows what I was going through, and she recommended a book called 'The Apron and Napoleon's Hat', by Dr H.Murray. It's an ebook available on the ibook store and I think it's on Kindle and a few other e-readers. Brilliant!! If you like a bloody funny read about real and gross medical stuff, and more importantly, a book that tells mental illness like it really is and helps to remove the stigma written by someone who knows what he is talking about, read it and tell your friends. We need doctors like this who can genuinely relate. Feel much better now and without meds.

Later this month it will be the 21st anniversary of our son's stillbirth. Part of me would love to celebrate this occasion with a party, I don't think any of the family remember the date or year of our son's birth/death, and that is fine. We never talk about the loss of our children to our families, I have a couple of very close friends I can share some of my feelings with, so at least that is something.
Instead, I will remember our son in my heart and mind on his special day, take myself out to lunch somewhere nice as my husband will be busy that day doing his won stuff, and he doesn't want to know about our children any more than the family do.
I might buy something special to celebrate the occasion, and to keep as a memory of what would have been our son's 21st.
Just writing this, has me in tears. Just wanted to share my rambling thoughts with someone who might care.
¬†
¬†¬† Cheers, from Dools.
